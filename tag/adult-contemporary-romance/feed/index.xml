										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fourth novel in the #1 New York Times and #1 USA Today bestselling Crossfire series.     </p>
<p>                    Gideon calls me his angel, but he&#8217;s the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own.     </p>
<p>                     The vows we&#8217;d exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn&#8217;t sure I was strong enough to bear.     </p>
<p>                     At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we&#8217;d worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we&#8217;d had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 6 million copy global bestselling Crossfire series from Sylvia Day continues in Entwined with You as Eva and Gideon face the demons of their pasts and accept the consequences of their obsessive desires . . .    </p>
<p>                    From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn&#8217;t resist. I also saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside &#8211; so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat.    </p>
<p>                    No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I&#8217;d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become.    </p>
<p>                    Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bared to You by Sylvia Day is the first in the Crossfire trilogy featuring Gideon and Eva, two wounded souls who come together in an explosion of lust and passion as intoxicating as it is devastating &#8211; the perfect read for fans of bestselling erotic romance Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. Our journey began in fire&#8230;Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness &#8211; beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white hot. I was drawn to him as I&#8217;d never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily&#8230;Gideon knew. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other&#8217;s most private wounds &#8230;and desires. The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn&#8217;t tear us apart&#8230;Intensely romantic, darkly sensual and completely addictive, Bared to You will take you to the very limits of obsession &#8211; and beyond.<br />
                    Sylvia Day is the number one New York Times and number one international bestselling author of more than a dozen award-winning novels, which have been translated into thirty eight languages. She has been nominated for the Goodreads Choice Award for Best Author and her work has been honoured as Amazon&#8217;s Best of the Year in Romance. She has won the RT Book Reviews Reviewers&#8217; Choice Award and been nominated for the Romance Writers of America&#8217;s prestigious RITA award twice. The second novel in the series Reflected in You is available from Penguin in october. `Bared to You has an emotional feel similar to Fifty Shades of Grey&#8230;It is full of emotional angst, scorching love scenes, and a compelling story line.` (Dear Author). `While it is true that Bared to You has much in common with Fifty Shades of Grey, Bared to You is a more complete story, one that is better written. The characters are better developed and the story is far sexier. This is an erotic romance that should not be missed. It will make readers fall in love.` (Romance Novel News).<br />
                    `The secondary characters are just as flawed as Eva and Gideon, which makes Bared to You richer and more real to me than many of the contemporary books I&#8217;ve read in a while.` (Romance Junkies). `This is a sophisticated, provocative, titillating, highly erotic, sexually driven read and is extremely well done. I enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey, but I loved Bared to You.` (Swept Away by Romance). `This book was just incredible. I couldn&#8217;t put it down! The sex was so hot and the relationship was so juicy that I just had to know what was coming next!` (Read Our Lips). `It literally blew my mind and after finishing it, I wasn&#8217;t able to stop thinking about it! &#8230;Bared to You is an intense novel full of hardships, heartbreak, overcoming obstacles, trust, and most of all &#8230;trying to find love in a relationship that may seem hopeless. I truly and wholeheartedly was amazed by this book.` (Happy Ever After). `Bared to You obliterates the competition with its real, emotionally intense characters that deal with pain and pleasure with honesty`. (Joyfully Reviewed).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ice is a cold mistress. As the league&#8217;s most eligible goalie, Max Fournier has access to his fair share of willing puck bunnies, but right now he&#8217;s more interested in bringing home another championship than a one-night stand. A romantic at heart, Max believes in love; he&#8217;s just not great at relationships. So when he finally meets a nice girl who&#8217;s not blinded by his celebrity, he&#8217;s feeling the heat&#8211;and the pressure to save her from herself. Between working two jobs and raising her sister&#8217;s kids, Julianne Bradley doesn&#8217;t have time for sports&#8211;or men. All she knows about Max is that he&#8217;s the sexiest customer to ever grace her gas-station counter. And he sees past her tired eyes and makes Jules yearn for things she can&#8217;t have: a glamorous fling, a passionate lover, and the time to enjoy both. Max makes her feel like Cinderella, even though Jules has enough baggage to crush a glass slipper. Luckily, he&#8217;s no prince&#8211;only a fierce competitor determined to win her heart.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marek Fabritis is used to delivering blows, not receiving them. But when he gets tipped off by an anonymous email about his ex-girlfriend, the news leaves him ice cold-and it&#8217;s not because Gracen Moore is getting married to a total jerk. It&#8217;s the fact that Marek has a three-year-old daughter he never knew about. Now he&#8217;s going back home, not to play knight in shining armor but to make damn sure that no man takes what&#8217;s his. For the first time, there might be something more important than hockey. Gracen Moore has always loved Marek. That&#8217;s why she let him go, so he could pursue a career in the NHL. And that&#8217;s why she never told him about Lilly. Only now does Gracen realize that she made an unforgivable mistake. But is that any reason for Marek to crash her wedding and make an epic scene? If the spark that still smolders between them is to be trusted, maybe. Still, Gracen&#8217;s not getting her hopes up. Because she knows better than anyone that appearances aren&#8217;t always what they seem . . . Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a league full of troublemakers, Cold Fury defenseman Roman Sýkora stands out&#8211;at least when it comes to negative publicity. When he&#8217;s not chilling in the penalty box, the sizzling Czech skate demon is racking up tabloid headlines for his scandalous behavior with the ladies. But now Roman&#8217;s feeling the burn from management to clean up his act, or else. Luckily he&#8217;s got an enticing distraction: a fun-loving barista who plays the ukulele and brings out a side of Roman he didn&#8217;t know he had. Lexi Robertson came to Raleigh, North Carolina, to finally meet her father, Brian Brannon, and her half sister, Gray, both of whom work in the Cold Fury&#8217;s front office. That&#8217;s where she first meets sexy, intimidating Roman&#8211;who&#8217;s really a big softie at heart. As one relationship takes off, another begins: Brian seems to be clicking with Lexi&#8217;s boss at the coffee shop. But when the friction between Roman and her new family heats up, Lexi wonders whether she&#8217;s a pawn in their game. Feeling hurt and foolish, Lexi&#8217;s ready to quit while she&#8217;s ahead. Trouble is, Roman&#8217;s not ready to quit on her.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carolina Cold Fury star Garrett Samuelson never wants to miss out on a single minute of fun. Whether he&#8217;s playing hockey, hanging out with friends, or walking the red carpet with a new date on his arm, he lives every day to the fullest. When he meets Olivia Case, he sees someone who&#8217;s exactly his type&#8211;confident, sexy, and smart. But the more he pursues her, the more Garrett shares a side of himself that other women don&#8217;t normally get to see. Olivia has been keeping a secret. She&#8217;s undergoing treatment for some serious medical issues, and she doesn&#8217;t have time for a relationship with no guarantees&#8211;especially one with a hot-as-sin womanizer who won&#8217;t take no for an answer. But as she gets to know the real Garrett, Olivia can&#8217;t help falling for him . . . hard. To reveal the truth would mean risking everything&#8211;but you can&#8217;t score without taking the tough shots.    </p>

<p>                    Cooper Sullivan spent the summers of his youth on his grandparents&#8217; South Dakota ranch, sharing innocent games and stolen kisses with the neighbor girl, Lil Chance. Now, twelve years after they last walked together hand in hand, fate has brought them back to the Black Hills.    </p>
<p>                    Though the memory of Coop&#8217;s touch still haunts her, Lil has let nothing stop her dream of opening the Chance Wildlife Refuge, but something-or someone-has been keeping a close watch. When small pranks and acts of destruction escalate into a heartless attack on Lil&#8217;s beloved cougar, memories of an unsolved murder have Coop springing to action to keep Lil safe.     </p>
<p>                    Both of them know the natural dangers that lurk in the wild landscape of the Black Hills. But a killer of twisted and unnatural instincts has singled them out as prey&#8230;.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Off the ice, elite defenseman Hawke Therrien enjoys his fair share of booze and good times. And why shouldn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s worked his way up from the minor leagues and made himself a star. The only thing Hawke misses from that life is the pierced, tattooed free spirit who broke his heart without so much as an explanation. She&#8217;s almost unrecognizable when she walks back into his life seven years later, except for the look in her eyes that feels like a punch to the gut. Vale Campbell isn&#8217;t the same girl she was at twenty. As crazy as she was about Hawke, her reckless behavior and out-of-control drinking were starting to scare her. She had to clean up her act, and that would never happen with Hawke around. Cutting him loose was the hardest thing Vale ever had to do&#8211;until now. Because she&#8217;s still crazy about Hawke, and if he could ever learn to forgive her, they just might have a future together.Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one plays like Reed Olson, whether it&#8217;s hockey season or not. After back-to-back NHL championships, he&#8217;s craving a little R&#038;R. Reed leans to a specific type&#8211;blond, busty, and interested&#8211;and fortunately he has a little black book full of options. So why is it he can&#8217;t stop dreaming about the new girl who just moved in next door? A certified brainiac, she seems to want nothing to do with the hard-bodied athlete. Josie Ives desperately needs something her celebrity neighbor obviously doesn&#8217;t: solitude. Reed is everything she imagined&#8211;a little too good-looking, with a body that puts Greek gods to shame. But she didn&#8217;t expect he would also be funny and charming. Josie knows she&#8217;s the opposite of his type, and that&#8217;s fine with her. Still, the chemistry between them is undeniable. Their newfound friendship certainly has its benefits, but she&#8217;s starting to wonder if opposites really do attract. Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the league&#8217;s toughest enforcers, Van Turner is ruthless on the ice. He plays hard because it&#8217;s the only way to channel the rage boiling inside, and a reputation as an A-hole is better than everyone knowing the truth. Van has spent his entire life running from a secret that&#8217;s kept him from getting involved in relationships-or accepting lucrative deals with East Coast teams. Then the Carolina Cold Fury makes him an offer he can&#8217;t refuse . . . and Van meets a woman he can&#8217;t resist. Simone Fournier is the stubborn one in her family-and that&#8217;s saying something, considering her brothers are two of the Cold Fury&#8217;s biggest stars. Simone gets what she wants, and what she wants is Van. Still, there&#8217;s a part of him Simone can&#8217;t reach, no matter how hard she tries. In private, he&#8217;s all fire and passion. In public, he freezes her out. Van may want to push her away, but Simone won&#8217;t let him go that easily. Because this time, she&#8217;s playing for keeps. Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Carolina Cold Fury hockey team is stacked with hotshots. But when a new player joins their ranks, he learns that even superstars can&#8217;t go it alone when it comes to love. Lucas Fournier is only serious about one thing: hockey. The league&#8217;s fun-loving charmer, Luc is always up for a good prank or a great lay, and he has no intention of settling down. But being traded to the Carolina Cold Fury&#8211;and to play alongside his big brother, Max&#8211;is no joke. With another title in sight, the last thing Luc wants is to let his new teammates down. To succeed, Luc will need to keep his head in the game and the most . . . er, demanding member of his anatomy in check. But when temptation hits, Luc hits back harder. Museum curator Stephanie Frazier has always put business before pleasure, which just about explains her nonexistent sex life. But when Stephanie meets Luc at a champagne-fueled gala, she finds herself flirting like crazy&#8211;and going home with the uninhibited athlete. For one night, she learns what passion is all about. She just never counted on the little surprise Luc leaves behind. And that&#8217;s when things really start to get interesting.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hockey star Alexander Crossman has a reputation as a cold-hearted player on and off the ice. Pushed into the sport by his alcoholic father, Alex isn&#8217;t afraid to give fans the proverbial middle finger, relishing his role as the MVP they love to hate. Management, however, isn&#8217;t so amused. Now Alex has a choice: fix his public image through community service or ride the bench. But Alex refuses to be molded into the Carolina Cold Fury poster boy . . . not even by a tempting redhead with killer curves. As a social worker, Sutton Price is accustomed to difficult people like Alex, who&#8217;s been assigned to help her create a drug-abuse awareness program for at-risk youth as part of the Fury&#8217;s effort to clean up his image. What she doesn&#8217;t expect is the arrogant smirk from his perfect lips stirring her most heated fantasies. But Sutton isn&#8217;t one to cross professional boundaries-and besides, Alex doesn&#8217;t do relationships . . . or does he? The more she sees behind Alex&#8217;s bad-boy fa�ade, the more Sutton craves the man she uncovers.    </p>

<p>                    Jack Norton is a GhostWalker, a genetically enhanced sniper with a merciless sense of justice, a phantom welcomed by the anonymity of the night. But a mission to rescue his brother in the jungle has left him vulnerable to rebel forces. His only salvation is his power of telepathy. Then he meets Briony, an unusual beauty on a mission of her own. But they share more than the sweltering heat&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Briony shares the GhostWalker powers. Yet she&#8217;s different. She doesn&#8217;t know what she is, or what she&#8217;s capable of. But her enemies do. And Jack and Briony&#8217;s flight will take them into a frightening conspiracy of mind and body&#8211;across the globe, and into the heart of darkness where the shocking truth is something neither of them could have foreseen&#8211;or can escape.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Christine Feehan reaches new heights of passion and suspense in this thrilling novel that takes readers deep into the California backcountry, where a woman is tormented by visions of a killer.  </p>
<p>                    It starts in her dreams. Hideous flashes from a nightmare only she can stop. Images of a murderer stalking the ones she cares about most&#8230;  </p>
<p>                    Stella Harrison thought she got away from the traumas of her past. Running the Sunrise Lake resort high in the Sierra Nevada mountains has brought her peace, even though she doesn&#8217;t truly share her quiet life with anyone. Not even Sam, the hired handyman that notices everything and always seems to know exactly what she needs. </p>
<p>                    Stella doesn&#8217;t know anything about Sam&#8217;s past, but somehow over the last two years his slow, steady presence has slipped past her defenses. Still, she knows she can&#8217;t tell him about her recent premonitions. So far there&#8217;s been no murder. No body. No way to prove what&#8217;s about to happen without destroying the life she&#8217;s built for herself. </p>
<p>                    But a killer is out there. And Stella knows that this time she&#8217;ll do whatever it takes to stop him.</p>

<p>                    Sometimes the past is better left behind you&#8230;.     </p>
<p>                    Lena Turner has spent her life as the outsider. Thanks to her extraordinary gifts, she&#8217;s learned to be independent &#8211; especially when it comes to men. She&#8217;s content to live her life in New Orleans as a schoolteacher, dating casually and dedicated to her small family. Long term is not part of her plan.     </p>
<p>                    Sometimes the past catches up with you&#8230;.     </p>
<p>                    Leaving Lena behind to pursue his career was the most difficult thing Mason Coulter ever did. He told himself that it was for the best, had even convinced himself that he had only Lena&#8217;s best interests in mind. But now, after six long years, he&#8217;s back in New Orleans to settle his late eccentric aunt&#8217;s estate. All he has to do is get in and out of the city without submitting to the need to see Lena. But to Mason&#8217;s dismay, his aunt made other plans.     </p>
<p>                    And sometimes the future and the past collide&#8230;.     </p>
<p>                    Having Mason walk back into her life is something Lena never saw coming. She could refuse to help him, but she&#8217;s never been good at telling Mason no. So she&#8217;ll do what she can to get the estate settled and Mason out of her life for good.     </p>
<p>                    At least that&#8217;s the plan. But Mason has plans of his own&#8230;.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After staring down the wrong end of a gun, not once, but twice, all Patty Harmon had wanted was to have a little fun. She&#8217;d spent most of her life taking care of everyone else but herself. While she had a plan for her life, she hadn&#8217;t yet started to live her life. So, when the aloof, distant, and emotionally unavailable New York State Trooper Reese McGinn takes an interest in her, she&#8217;s all in&#8230;for the moment.     </p>
<p>                    When the moment is over, they go their separate ways, and Patty can get back to her life plan. But once again, that plan is interrupted when Patty finds herself pregnant. She&#8217;ll let Reese back in for the sake of the child, but can she keep Reese from stealing her heart?     </p>
<p>                    New York State Trooper Reese McGinn has been haunted by his late mother&#8217;s confession and the secret she took to her grave. For the last seven years, he&#8217;s done nothing but move from job to job and town to town, vowing to never put down roots. But when his summer fling with Patty Harmon ends with a child on the way, he decides it&#8217;s time to forget the past.     </p>
<p>                    Only, the past doesn&#8217;t want to forget him, and a deadly secret rises from the grave, threatening to take away everything he thought he never wanted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Family. Responsibility. Stability. As the co-CEO of Bayou Enterprises and the eldest of the Boudreaux clan, Beau is the epitome of these. Now that his baby sister, Gabby, is happily settled down, Beau has moved into the company loft in the heart of the French Quarter to be closer to his office while his own home is built. He doesn&#8217;t have time for anything but the family he adores and the company that drives him.     </p>
<p>                    If only the bewitching owner of the herb shop downstairs from Beau&#8217;s loft weren&#8217;t so damn tempting.     </p>
<p>                    Mallory Adams is living the life. The good life. The best life for her. After years of hiding who she is and the gifts she&#8217;s been cursed with, Mallory opened her little shop in the French Quarter, offering herbs and lotions for anything from soothing a sunburn to chasing those pesky ghosts New Orleans is known for out of a client&#8217;s home. Some call her eccentric, and some say she&#8217;s simply odd, and that&#8217;s okay with her. She is a bit odd, but in her experience, all of the best people are.     </p>
<p>                    When an old pipe bursts in the loft above her store, flooding her storeroom, Mallory comes face to face with Beau Boudreaux, and she doesn&#8217;t need the clairvoyant abilities that have been passed down through generations to know that she&#8217;ll never be the same. Beau is her exact opposite: serious, straitlaced. He wears suits, for Pete&#8217;s sake, and probably wouldn&#8217;t know the difference between arnica and flaxseed if his life depended on it. But when he touches her, the electricity is through the roof, and she&#8217;s smart enough to know that a chemistry like theirs doesn&#8217;t happen every day.     </p>
<p>                    Can two people so very different possibly find their way to happily ever after?</p>

<p>                    Emilia<br />
                    They say love and hate are the same feelings experienced under different circumstances, and it&#8217;s true.<br />
                    The man who comes to me in my dreams also haunts me in my nightmares.<br />
                    He is a brilliant lawyer.<br />
                    A skilled criminal.<br />
                    A beautiful liar.<br />
                    A bully and a savior, a monster and a lover.<br />
                    Ten years ago, he made me run away from the small town where we lived. Now, he came for me in New York, and he isn&#8217;t leaving until he takes me with him.     </p>
<p>                    Vicious<br />
                    She is a starving artist.<br />
                    Pretty and evasive like cherry blossom.<br />
                    Ten years ago, she barged into my life unannounced and turned everything upside down.<br />
                    She paid the price.<br />
                    Emilia LeBlanc is completely off-limits, my best friend&#8217;s ex-girlfriend. The woman who knows my darkest secret, and the daughter of the cheap Help we hired to take care of our estate.<br />
                    That should deter me from chasing her, but it doesn&#8217;t.<br />
                    So she hates me. Big fucking deal.<br />
                    She better get used to me.     </p>
<p>                    Vicious is a complete standalone and a part of the Sinners of Saint series</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I met Bianca in an elevator.    </p>
<p>                     She was on her way to interview me when we got stuck.<br />
                     The beautiful raven-haired reporter assumed I was a delivery guy because of the way I was dressed.    </p>
<p>                     She had no clue I was really Dex Truitt, the wealthy, successful businessman she&#8217;d dubbed &#8220;Mister Moneybags&#8221;―her afternoon appointment.    </p>
<p>                     Bianca told me how much she hated Dex&#8217;s type―snobby, over educated, silver-spooned men who didn&#8217;t appreciate the simple things in life.    </p>
<p>                     So, after the elevator finally started moving again, I cancelled the interview and let her believe I was someone I wasn&#8217;t―a bike messenger named Jay. I loved the way she looked at the fake me and didn&#8217;t want it to end.    </p>
<p>                     I began dating her as &#8220;Jay&#8221;―all the while letting her interview the real me over email.    </p>
<p>                     I didn&#8217;t expect that our chemistry online would be just as hot.<br />
                     I didn&#8217;t expect the mess I&#8217;d gotten myself into.<br />
                     I didn&#8217;t expect that Jay and Dex would fall in love with her.    </p>
<p>                     And she was falling for two men.<br />
                     Only, both men were me.<br />
                     And when she found out, we were both going to lose her.    </p>
<p>                     Nothing could have prepared me for that day. And I certainly wasn&#8217;t prepared for what came after.    </p>
<p>                     All good things must come to an end, right?<br />
                     Except our ending was one I didn&#8217;t see coming.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beards, brothers, and bikers! Oh my!    </p>
<p>                    Identical twins Beau and Duane Winston might share the same devastatingly handsome face, but where Beau is outgoing and sociable, Duane is broody and reserved. This is why Jessica James, recent college graduate and perpetual level-headed good girl, has been in naive and unhealthy infatuation with Beau Winston for most of her life.    </p>
<p>                    His friendly smiles make her tongue-tied and weak-kneed, and she&#8217;s never been able to move beyond her childhood crush. Whereas Duane and Jessica have always been adversaries. She can&#8217;t stand him, and she&#8217;s pretty sure he can&#8217;t stand the sight of her&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    But after a case of mistaken identity, Jessica finds herself in a massive confusion kerfuffle. Jessica James has spent her whole life paralyzed by the fantasy of Beau and her assumptions of Duane&#8217;s disdain; therefore she&#8217;s unprepared for the reality that is Duane&#8217;s insatiable interest, as well as his hot hands and hot mouth and hotter looks. Not helping Jessica&#8217;s muddled mind and good girl sensibilities, Duane seems to have gotten himself in trouble with the local biker gang, the Iron Order.    </p>
<p>                    Certainly, Beau&#8217;s magic spell is broken. Yet when Jessica finds herself drawn to the man who was always her adversary, now more dangerous than ever, how much of her level-head heart is she willing to risk?</p>

Inside, he&#8217;s battling his own demons, shunning relationships, and finding solace in the arms of a string of anonymous women paid very well for their discretion. But when he&#8217;s photographed in a compromising position by an over-eager reporter, the only way to save his career is to say that the woman he was with is his fianc&#8217;e. And now Lyle has to play a very public game with the only woman who&#8217;s ever managed to get under his skin.     </p>
<p>                    Struggling waitress Sugar Laine agrees to spend one night with Lyle &#8211; but only because she&#8217;s desperate to save her family home.

<p>                    Losing has never been easy for a Maddox, but death always wins.     </p>
<p>                    Eleven years to the day after eloping in Vegas with Abby, Special Agent Travis Maddox delivers his own brand of vigilante justice to mob boss Benny Carlisi. Vegas&#8217;s oldest and most violent crime family is now preparing for vengeance, and the entire Maddox family is a target.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author Gena Showalter is back with a sizzling Original Heartbreakers tale about an icy war vet and the only woman capable of melting him&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    With trust issues a mile long, Ryanne Wade has sworn off men. Then Jude Laurent walks into her bar, and all bets are off. The former army ranger has suffered unimaginably, first being maimed in battle then losing his wife and daughters to a drunk driver. Making the brooding widower smile is priority one. Resisting him? Impossible.     </p>
<p>                    For Jude, Ryanne is off-limits. And yet the beautiful bartender who serves alcohol to potential motorists tempts him like no other. When a rival bar threatens her livelihood&#8211;and her life&#8211;he can&#8217;t turn away. She triggers something in him he thought long buried, and he&#8217;s determined to protect her, whatever the cost.     </p>
<p>                    As their already scorching attraction continues to heat, the damaged soldier knows he must let go of his past to hold on to his future&#8230;or risk losing the second chance he desperately needs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author Brenda Novak returns to Silver Springs with a moving story about rebuilding your life when you&#8217;ve got nothing left to lose     </p>
<p>                    Savanna Gray needs a do-over. Her &#8220;perfect&#8221; life unraveled when, to her absolute shock, her husband was arrested for attacking three women. With her divorce settled, she takes her two children home to Silver Springs to seek refuge between the walls of the farmhouse where she was born. It needs a little TLC, but she&#8217;s eager to take control of something.     </p>
<p>                    Gavin Turner understands the struggle of starting over. Abandoned at a gas station when he was five, it wasn&#8217;t until he landed at New Horizons Boys Ranch as a teen that he finally found some peace. He steps up when Savanna needs help fixing things&#8211;even when those things go beyond the farmhouse.     </p>
<p>                    Despite an escalating attraction to Gavin, Savanna resolves to keep her distance. She trusted her ex, who had a similarly tragic background, and is unwilling to repeat her past mistakes. But it&#8217;s hard to resist a man whose heart is as capable as his hands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From New York Times Bestselling author Kristen Proby comes a series set in the intriguing New Orleans, Louisiana. A powerful family, the Boudreaux siblings are successful and ready to find love!Simon Danbury, an internationally sought-after motivational speaker, helps women from all walks of life with love, self-esteem, dating and career building skills. Handsome, witty and wealthy, Simon seemingly has everything a man could want. But appearances can be deceiving. While Simon may have the answers for millions of women all over the world, when it comes to his own love life, he&#8217;s a giant, sexy mess. Divorced, and convinced that he&#8217;ll never love again, the very last thing he expects is one Charly Boudreaux. Charly doesn&#8217;t want to be at this seminar in the middle of nowhere, but her sister made her go. She&#8217;s the one who has her life together. Great career, amazing family, nice home, and loyal friends. So what if she doesn&#8217;t have a man? She doesn&#8217;t need one. If she&#8217;s learned anything in her almost thirty years, it&#8217;s that men are more trouble than they&#8217;re worth. And they have a nasty habit of breaking your heart into a million tiny pieces. So, she&#8217;ll sit through all of Simon&#8217;s touchy-feely crap and go home and get on with her life. Except Simon isn&#8217;t really spouting crap, and when he smiles at her, the butterflies are ridiculous. Never mixing business with pleasure, Simon finds Charly to be a bright spot in a universe that&#8217;s been dark for too long. But will he be able to resist her? And why would he want to?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fortuitous encounter. A meeting that should never have happened.     </p>
<p>                    Many years ago, two children from completely different worlds forged a connection, a fateful connection, an unbreakable bond that would change their lives forever&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Salome knows only one way to live &#8211; under Prophet David&#8217;s rule. In the commune she calls home, Salome knows nothing of life beyond her strict faith, nor of life beyond the Fence &#8211; the fence that cages her, keeps her trapped in an endless cycle of misery. A life she believes she is destined to always lead, until a horrific event sets her free.     </p>
<p>                    Fleeing the absolute safety of all she has ever known, Salome is thrust into the world outside, a frightening world full of uncertainty and sin; into the protective arms of a person she believed she would never see again.     </p>
<p>                    River &#8216;Styx&#8217; Nash knows one thing for certain in life &#8211; he was born and bred to wear a cut. Raised in a turbulent world of sex, Harleys, and drugs, Styx, unexpectedly has the heavy burden of the Hades Hangmen gavel thrust upon him, and all at the ripe old age of twenty-six &#8211; much to his rivals&#8217; delight.     </p>
<p>                    Haunted by a crushing speech impediment, Styx quickly learns to deal with his haters. Powerful fists, an iron jaw, and the skillful use of his treasured German blade has earned him a fearsome reputation as a man not to be messed with in the shadowy world of outlaw MC&#8217;s. A reputation that successfully keeps most people far, far away.     </p>
<p>                    Styx has one rule in life &#8211; never let anyone get too close. It&#8217;s a plan that he has stuck to for years, that is, until a young woman is found injured on his lot&#8230;a woman who looks uncannily familiar, a woman who clearly does not belong in his world, yet a woman he feels reluctant to let go&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Available in audio first, New York Times best-selling author Laurelin Paige&#8217;s newest red-hot romance!     </p>
<p>                    Weston King knows how to play. But wild nights and owning an extensive collection of women&#8217;s panties don&#8217;t carry the thrill they once did, so when his business partner, Donovan, suggests an outrageous plan to allow them to take over their competition, Wes takes him up on the offer. The crazy idea? Marry the competitor.     </p>
<p>                    Elizabeth Dyson, the bride-to-be in question, is on board with the plan. She wants access to her trust fund and can only get it once she marries. Each has something the other wants &#8211; all they have to do is pretend to like each other well enough to tie the knot.     </p>
<p>                    Only trouble is, playing fiancé to Elizabeth isn&#8217;t quite that simple. Wes finds her sexy and brilliant&#8230;and soon wishes their engagement wasn&#8217;t fake at all. Not that he&#8217;d ever tell her that.     </p>
<p>                    But a lover boy like Wes can stand an empty bed only for so long&#8230;and even the best of players has to put down his cards eventually.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stella Lane thinks math is the only thing that unites the universe. She comes up with algorithms to predict customer purchases&#8211;a job that has given her more money than she knows what to do with as well as way less experience in the dating department than the average thirty-year-old. It doesn&#8217;t help that she has Asperger&#8217;s and that French kissing reminds her of a shark getting its teeth cleaned by pilot fish. She decides that she needs lots of practice&#8211;with a professional&#8211;which is why she hires escort Michael Phan. The Vietnamese-Swedish stunner can&#8217;t afford to turn down Stella&#8217;s offer, and he agrees to help her check off all the boxes on her lesson plan&#8211;from foreplay to more-than-missionary position&#8230; Before long, Stella not only learns to appreciate his kisses but also to crave all of the other things he&#8217;s making her feel. Their no-nonsense partnership starts making a strange kind of sense. And the pattern that emerges convinces Stella that love is the best kind of logic.</p>

<p>                    Sam Shaw hat für seinen Erfolg hart gearbeitet und sich aus dem Nichts ein millionenschweres Vermögen aufgebaut &#8211; weshalb er noch nie Zeit für Beziehungen hatte. Auch als er die Galeriebesitzerin Grace Astor kennenlernt, scheinen die Spielregeln klar: eine Nacht, nicht mehr. Egal wie sehr sie ihm unter die Haut geht. Doch als Grace mitten in der Nacht Sams Wohnung ohne ein weiteres Wort verlässt und sich nicht mehr meldet, ist sein Ehrgeiz geweckt. Er will der hübschen Prinzessin von Manhattan beweisen, wer in den Schlafzimmern der Park Avenue den Ton angibt &#8211; auch wenn er dabei riskieren muss, sein Herz zu verlieren.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eva and Gideon return in `Reflected in You`, the second novel in the erotic romance `Crossfire` series, following on from `Bared to You` &#8211; this is the perfect read for those who loved `Fifty Shades of Grey`, `Fifty Shades Darker` and `Fifty Shades Freed` by E.L. James. Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn&#8217;t stay away. I didn&#8217;t want to. He was my addiction&#8230;my every desire&#8230;mine. My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We&#8217;d never work. It was too hard, too painful&#8230;except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession&#8230;Intensely romantic, darkly sensual and completely addictive, Sylvia Day&#8217;s `Reflected in You` will take you to the very limits of obsession &#8211; and beyond. `If I were to recommend any book today to readers who enjoyed `Fifty Shades of Grey`&#8230;[this] would be the first one I would offer&#8230;It is full of emotional angst, scorching love scenes, and a compelling story line.<br />
                    `  (`Dear Author`). `Far sexier than `Fifty Shades of Grey`&#8230;this is an erotic romance that should not be missed.` (`Romance Novel News`). `I became so attached to Eva and Gideon that I actually hurt for them. I shared their pain and their joy as they fought to keep each other.` (`Joyfully Reviewed`). `A well written and sexually charged romance with characters who have real depth &#8230;it&#8217;s what `Fifty Shades of Grey` should have been.` (`The Book Pushers`). Sylvia Day is the `New York Times` and `USA Today` bestselling author of over a dozen novels written across multiple sub-genres &#8211; contemporary, fantasy, historical, futuristic, science fiction, romantic suspense, paranormal romance, and urban fantasy &#8211; under multiple pen names: three! A wife and mother of two, she is a former Russian linguist for the U.S. Army Military Intelligence. The first novel in the `Crossfire` series, `Bared to You`, is also published by Penguin.</p>

<p>                    When Jackson St. James decided that six weeks in Vermont&#8217;s Green Mountains would help him get his life together, he didn&#8217;t anticipate replacing his craving for whiskey with a craving for his alluring new landlord, Gabby. Now, instead of prioritizing his sobriety and the resolution of the lawsuit threatening his business, he&#8217;s making excuses to spend time with the spunky young landscaper whose candor is more than a little addictive.    </p>
<p>                    Gabby Decouteau refuses to let her pill-popping mother and unreliable baby daddy turn her into a cynic, so she doesn&#8217;t fight her attraction to her enigmatic new tenant. Although Jackson&#8217;s smile rarely reaches his eyes, his generosity and dependability make her willing to overlook his demons. But once she convinces Jackson to give in to temptation, Gabby&#8217;s jealous ex threatens to disrupt the life Gabby has built for herself and her son.    </p>
<p>                    With so much at stake, Gabby and Jackson must decide if love is worth the risk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are three things you should know about Quinn Sullivan: 1) He is madly in love with Janie Morris, 2) He&#8217;s not above playing dirty to get what (or who) he wants, and 3) He doesn&#8217;t know how to knit.    </p>
<p>                    After just five months of dating Janie, Quinn&#8211;former Wendell and unapologetic autocrat&#8211;is ready to propose marriage. In fact, he&#8217;s more than ready. If it were up to Quinn, he would efficiently propose, marry, and beget Janie with child all in the same day&#8211;thereby avoiding the drama and angst that accompanies the four stages of pre-matrimony: engagement, meeting the parents, bachelor/bachelorette party, and overblown, superfluous wedding day traditions.    </p>
<p>                    But Janie, much to Quinn&#8217;s dismay, tosses a wrench in his efficacious endeavors and challenges him to prove his devotion by going through the matrimonial motions, no matter how minute and mundane.    </p>
<p>                    Will Quinn last until the wedding day? Or will he yield to his tyrant impulses?    </p>
<p>                    This book is not a standalone. It is the sequel to &#8216;Neanderthal Seeks Human, &#8216; and is book #1.5 in the Knitting in the City series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adam Spencer loves women. All women. Every shape and size, regardless of hair or eye color, religion or race, he simply enjoys them all. Meeting more than his fair share as the manager and head bartender of The Odyssey, a hot spot in the heart of New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter, Adam&#8217;s comfortable with his lifestyle, and sees no reason to change it. A wife and kids, plus the white picket fence are not in the cards for this confirmed bachelor. Until a beautiful woman, and her sweet princess, literally knock him on his ass. Sarah Cox has just moved to New Orleans, having accepted a position as a social worker specializing in at-risk women and children. It&#8217;s a demanding, sometimes dangerous job, but Sarah is no shy wallflower. She can handle just about anything that comes at her, even the attentions of one sexy Adam Spencer. Just because he&#8217;s charmed her daughter, making her think of magical kingdoms with happily ever after, doesn&#8217;t mean that Sarah believes in fairy tales. But the more time she spends with the enchanting man, the more he begins to sway her into believing in forever. Even so, when Sarah&#8217;s job becomes more dangerous than any of them bargained for, will she be ripped from Adam&#8217;s life forever?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is there room for two in that sleeping bag?     </p>
<p>                    When it comes to love, a chiseled loner takes the scenic route in this irresistible stand-alone from the author of Eye Candy (&#8220;Truly the perfect romantic comedy.&#8221; &#8211;Lauren Layne).     </p>
<p>                    Dax After spending months buried up to my eyeballs in my family&#8217;s affairs, I&#8217;m ready for a break. The kind of break where I can spend two solid weeks camping and fishing in the company of absolutely no one. Then I find myself directly in the path of a drop-dead gorgeous tornado by the name of Becca Stone. Who can resist a night with a damsel in distress? Especially when she happens to be a leggy blonde? The last thing I expect is for Becca to show up on my cabin doorstep the next night, shivering in the rain and ready for seconds.     </p>
<p>                    Becca One minute I&#8217;m admiring the rock-hard jaw of the Magic Mike lookalike who walks into my bar, and the next I&#8217;m getting fired by my own brother. Loudly. In front of everyone. Luckily Dax Vaughn is a gentleman who aims his white-hot smile at me. Oh, it&#8217;s on. Wham, bam, thank you ma&#8217;am. Then a torrential storm washes out the main road and causes a massive power outage, giving us two whole weeks to enjoy each other&#8217;s company. At which point Dax will go back home, leaving &#8220;us&#8221; in the rearview mirror. That&#8217;s the plan. Or it was&#8230;until I started falling for him.     </p>
<p>                    Look for Jessica Lemmon&#8217;s stand-alone romances with heartfelt HEAs:     </p>
<p>                    Fighting for Devlin<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>USA TODAY BESTSELLING romantic comedy series &#8216;Dating-ish&#8217; can be read as a standalone, is a full length 100k word novel, and is book #6 in the Knitting in the City Series. There are three things you need to know about Marie Harris: 1) She&#8217;s fed up with online dating, 2) She&#8217;s so fed up, she&#8217;s willing to forego the annoyance and consider more creative alternatives, and 3) She knows how to knit. After the most bizarre and irritating first date in the history of humankind, Marie is looking for an alternative to men. With the help of her friends, she quickly identifies a few possibilities: Need a cuddle? Use a professional cuddler. Need affirmation? Get yourself a life coach. Need an orgasm? Try orgasm meditation! Why does she need the hassle of a romantic partner when she can meet all her needs with paid services? But then her irritating date resurfaces. And he&#8217;s not at all the person she thought he was. And he suggests a different&#8211;and crazier&#8211;solution to her dilemma . . . As everyone knows (or will soon come to realize), traditional relations between humans are a thing of the past. Robots are our future. And if robots are our future, then why do we need other people at all?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Esther Williams Sanchez is busy living her life the way she&#8217;s always done. Spending time with her pets, working as a divorce mediator, and enjoying her newly renovated cottage on the beach. She&#8217;s also decided it&#8217;s high time she learn how to swim to prepare for an upcoming cruise. It&#8217;s time to let go of a horrible past experience and take some lessons. So at thirty-two, Esther enrolls in the only class at the Y with a spot left. A Mommy and Me class-which seems quite tame, considering her oldest classmate aside from her is three-years-old. Learn to swim with a bunch of babies and toddlers? Easy-squeezy, right? Er, no. As Esther leaves the pool after her very first lesson, she sprouts a magnificent tail and fins. Oh, and hair the color of a rainbow. Lots and lots of luscious hair. Lucky for her, the OOPS girls are on site, and as they set about finding out how this happened to Esther, they run into a hunky Australian merman named Tucker Pearson who happens to be the key to Esther&#8217;s problem. But Tucker has problems of his own, and they include being kicked out of his family&#8217;s bottled water company, booted from his pod, and accused of embezzling over a million bucks. Oh, and killing someone . . . OOPS, here we go again!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author K. Bromberg is back with an all new second-chance, standalone hockey romance.     </p>
<p>                    At first, the request seemed simple-sign a new athlete to the agency.     </p>
<p>                    Then I found out the new athlete was none other than the most wanted man in hockey today: Hunter Maddox     </p>
<p>                    Gifted. Sexy. At the top of his game. And the only man who has ever broken my heart.     </p>
<p>                    If signing him will help save our family business, I&#8217;ll swallow my pride and do what&#8217;s asked.     </p>
<p>                    But when it becomes clear his uncharacteristic antics off the ice are a hint of something deeper, keeping things strictly professional between us becomes more than complicated. But I know better than to cross that line.    </p>
<p>                    I&#8217;ll never date a client. Not even for him.     </p>
<p>                    ***     </p>
<p>                    Win the Stanley Cup and do it before time runs out.     </p>
<p>                    Not a small feat, but it&#8217;s what&#8217;s motivated me since the start of my career.     </p>
<p>                    And time is running out.     </p>
<p>                    Enter Dekker Kincade.     </p>
<p>                    Feisty. Dogged. Damn gorgeous. The one I let get away.     </p>
<p>                    I have no idea why she&#8217;s traveling with the team, but hell if resisting her is going to be easy.     </p>
<p>                    But I have a job to do, and I refuse to lose sight of that end game. Even if she confuses me. Even if she sees parts of me I&#8217;ve hidden from the world.     </p>
<p>                    I can&#8217;t lose focus. Not even for her.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re a Delta Force soldier, you see a lot. Often too much. But nothing can ever prepare you to see your entire team die before your eyes&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    The loss of his Delta brothers-and his arm-has Dane &#8220;Fish&#8221; Munroe still struggling months later. He&#8217;s moved to Idaho, where an isolated lifestyle is making things worse, not better. Not that there&#8217;s anyone left to care.    </p>
<p>                    Actually, Bryn Hartwell cares. In fact, she tries to surreptitiously make life just a little easier for the mysterious man who comes into the grocery where she works late at night, only to get a tongue lashing for her trouble. Still, he&#8217;s obviously hurting; someone has to worry about him, spurring Bryn to nurse Dane when he hits a particularly low point.    </p>
<p>                    Intrigued by the quirky, kind, socially awkward woman, Dane allows himself to get close to someone for the first time in ages. A potentially epic mistake-because when her interest in the prepper lifestyle puts Bryn in the hands of a homegrown terrorist, losing her could put Dane&#8217;s mental recovery permanently out of reach.    </p>
<p>                    But once a Delta, always a Delta. And there&#8217;s a team in Texas who are ready to have Dane&#8217;s back at a moment&#8217;s notice.    </p>
<p>                    **Rescuing Bryn is the 6th book in the Delta Force Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author Kristen Proby delivers another sizzling novel in her delectable and sexy Fusion series.  Riley Gibson is over the moon at the prospect of having her restaurant, Seduction, on the Best Bites TV network. This could be the big break she&#8217;s been waiting for. But the idea of having an in-house show on a regular basis is a whole other matter. Their lives would be turned upside down, and convincing Mia, her best friend and head chef of Seduction, that having cameras in her kitchen every day is a good idea is daunting. Still, Riley knows it&#8217;s an opportunity she can&#8217;t afford to pass on. And when she meets Trevor Cooper, the show&#8217;s executive producer, she&#8217;s stunned by their intense chemistry.  Trevor&#8217;s sole intention is to persuade Riley to allow Best Bites TV to do a show on her restaurant. But when he walks into Riley&#8217;s office, he stops dead in his tracks. The professional, aloof woman on the phone is incredibly beautiful and funny. But can he convince her that he&#8217;s interested in Riley for himself? Or is he using the undeniable pull between them to persuade her to agree to his offer?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His life is chaos and confusion. It&#8217;s a storm of uncertainty and raging emotion. Sutton Warner is a mess. Everything in his life feels like it&#8217;s unraveling. He&#8217;s let a lot of people down lately, including his daughter. Sutton always promised his little girl he would never disappoint her and that he would always be there when she needed him. Until he wasn&#8217;t. The truth is, he&#8217;s used to disappointing the women in his life. First was his mother who couldn&#8217;t find a reason to stick around when he was growing up. Then there&#8217;s his ex. The woman who takes unbridled delight in making his life incredibly complicated. Luckily, his daughter is still young enough to believe her old man is some kind of hero. But he knows the day is coming when she realizes the truth, that he&#8217;s just a man with some serious flaws and a list of ever-growing weaknesses. Finally, there&#8217;s the woman he&#8217;s desperately trying to forget with every shot tossed back and each pill popped. He more than disappointed Emrys&#8230;. He almost got her killed. Her love is steady and sure. It&#8217;s a shelter shaped by conviction and silent assurance.     </p>
<p>                    Emrys Santos is lost. Everything in her life feels pointless and futile. She&#8217;s been busy running away from her feelings and all the people who love her the most &#8211; including her best friend, the one person who knows exactly what she&#8217;s been through. They promised to always stick together and to lean on one another. It was a promise Em had to break so she could lick her wounds and figure out her next move. For once, there is no easy way out of the tangled web of emotions she&#8217;s caught up in, and right now, she recognizes that all roads lead back to Wyoming&#8230;and back to Sutton. The man she nearly got killed.     </p>
<p>                    Shelter is a standalone novel, the second book in the Getaway series, which features the hardheaded and brokenhearted Warner brothers and the women who dare to love them. These boys are very good at putting the wild in wilderness.</p>

<p>                    Ivy thought that she and Adrian had conquered their fates. Yet with thousands of innocents still trapped in the demon realms, she&#8217;s determined to locate the final hallowed weapon and harness its unparalleled power to free them. But the last relic nearly put Ivy in the grave-there&#8217;s probably no coming back from this one.     </p>
<p>                    Adrian&#8217;s dark lineage has made him the most powerful of his kind, yet even his incredible abilities might not be enough now. Instead, the treacherous fate he has fought so hard to escape might be the only way he can save Ivy. Their scintillating bond has been tested before, but never with so much on the line. Now fate will come head-to-head against true love, and nothing they&#8217;ve endured can prepare Ivy and Adrian for the unthinkable choices they&#8217;ll face.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Friends Without Benefits can be read as a standalone, is a full length 120k word novel, and is book #2 in the Knitting in the City Series. There are three things you need to know about Elizabeth Finney: 1) She suffers from severe sarcastic syndrome, especially when she&#8217;s unnerved, 2) No one unnerves her like Nico Manganiello, and 3) She knows how to knit. Elizabeth Finney is almost always right about everything: the musical merits of boy bands are undervalued by society, &#8220;benefits&#8221; with human Ken dolls are better without friendship, and the sun has set on her once-in-a-lifetime chance for true love. But when Elizabeth&#8217;s plans for benefits without friendship are disarmed by the irritatingly charismatic and chauvinistic Nico Manganiello- her former nemesis- she finds herself struggling to maintain the electric fence around her heart while avoiding electrocution or, worse, falling in love.</p>
