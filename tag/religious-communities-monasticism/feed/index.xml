										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most famous books ever written about a man&#8217;s search for faith and peace.      </p>
<p>                    The Seven Storey Mountain tells of the growing restlessness of a brilliant and passionate young man, who at the age of twenty-six, takes vows in one of the most demanding Catholic orders&#8211;the Trappist monks. At the Abbey of Gethsemani, &#8220;the four walls of my new freedom,&#8221; Thomas Merton struggles to withdraw from the world, but only after he has fully immersed himself in it. At the abbey, he wrote this extraordinary testament, a unique spiritual autobiography that has been recognized as one of the most influential religious works of our time. Translated into more than twenty languages, it has touched millions of lives.    </p>
