										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of America&#8217;s great chefs&#8221; (Vogue), Grant Achatz, shares how his drive to cook immaculate food fueled his miraculous triumph over tongue cancer.     </p>
<p>                    By 2007 chef Grant Achatz had been named one of the best new chefs in America by Food &#038; Wine, he had received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award, and he and Nick Kokonas had opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by Gourmet magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world&#8217;s culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer.    </p>
<p>                    The prognosis grim, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that ravaged his body and left him without a sense of taste. Tapping into his profound discipline and passion, he trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest, the food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free and went on to achieve some of the highest honors in the culinary world. Life, on the Line is not only a chef&#8217;s memoir, it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship.</p>
