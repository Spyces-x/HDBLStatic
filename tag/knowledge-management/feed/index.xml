										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of industry, most major companies are becoming technology companies. The successful management of information has become so critical to a company&#8217;s goals, that in many ways, now is the age of the CIO. Yet IT executives are besieged by a host of contradictions: bad technology can bring a company to its knees, but corporate boards rarely employ CIOs; CIOs must keep costs down at the very same time that they drive innovation. CIOs are focused on the future, while they are tethered by technology decisions made in the past. These contradictions form what Martha Heller calls The CIO Paradox, a set of conflicting forces that are deeply embedded in governance, staffing, executive expectations, and even corporate culture. Heller, who has spent more than 12 years working with the CIO community, offers guidance to CIOs on how to attack, reverse, or neutralize the paradoxical elements of the CIO role. Through interviews with a wide array of successful CIOs, The CIO Paradox helps readers level the playing field for IT success and get one step closer to bringing maximum value to their companies.</p>

<p>                    An international sensation&#8211;and still the talk of the relevant blogosphere&#8211;this Wall Street Journal and New York Times business bestseller examines the &#8220;power&#8221; in numbers. Today more than ever, number crunching affects your life in ways you might not even imagine. Intuition and experience are no longer enough to make the grade. In order to succeed&#8211;even survive&#8211;in our data-based world, you need to become statistically literate.     </p>
<p>                     Cutting-edge organizations are already crunching increasingly larger databases to find the unseen connections among seemingly unconnected things to predict human behavior with staggeringly accurate results. From Internet sites like Google and Amazon that use filters to keep track of your tastes and your purchasing history, to insurance companies and government agencies that every day make decisions affecting your life, the brave new world of the super crunchers is happening right now. No one who wants to stay ahead of the curve should make another keystroke without reading Ian Ayres&#8217;s engrossing and enlightening book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Achieving faster, better, cheaper, and more creative innovation outcomes with the 5&#215;5 framework: 5 people, 5 days, 5 experiments, $5,000, and 5 weeks.     </p>
<p>                    What is the best way for a company to innovate? Advice recommending &#8220;innovation vacations&#8221; and the luxury of failure may be wonderful for organizations with time to spend and money to waste. The Innovator&#8217;s Hypothesis addresses the innovation priorities of companies that live in the real world of limits. Michael Schrage advocates a cultural and strategic shift: small teams, collaboratively&#8211;and competitively&#8211;crafting business experiments that make top management sit up and take notice. He introduces the 5&#215;5 framework: giving diverse teams of five people up to five days to come up with portfolios of five business experiments costing no more than $5,000 each and taking no longer than five weeks to run. Successful 5x5s, Schrage shows, make people more effective innovators, and more effective innovators mean more effective innovations.</p>
