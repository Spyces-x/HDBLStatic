										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depression doesn&#8217;t happen all at once. It starts gradually and builds momentum over time. If you go through a difficult experience, you may stop taking care of yourself. You may stop exercising and eating healthy, which will end up making you feel even worse as time goes on. You are caught in a downward spiral, but you may feel too tired, too overwhelmed, and too scared to try and pull yourself back up. The good news is that just one small step can be a step in the right direction.    </p>
<p>                    In The Upward Spiral, neuroscientist Alex Korb demystifies the neurological processes in the brain that cause depression and offers effective ways to get better-one little step at a time. In the book, you&#8217;ll discover that there isn&#8217;t &#8220;one big solution&#8221; that will solve your depression. Instead, there are dozens of small, practical things you can do to alleviate your symptoms and start healing. Some are as simple as relaxing certain muscles to reduce feelings of anxiety, while others involve making small efforts toward more positive social interactions. Small steps in the right direction can have profound effects-giving you the power to literally &#8220;reshape&#8221; your brain.    </p>
<p>                    Like most people, you probably didn&#8217;t wake up one day and find yourself completely depressed. Instead, it probably happened over time, as a series of reactions to difficult situations and negative thinking. But if you are ready to reverse the trajectory of your depression and find lasting happiness, this book will show you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Extraordinary and courageous . . . No doubt if everyone were to read this book, the world would change.&#8221;&#8212;New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    New York Times-bestselling author Ron Powers&#8217; critically acclaimed narrative of the social history of mental illness in America paired with the deeply personal story of his two sons&#8217; battles with schizophrenia.    </p>
<p>                    From the centuries of torture of &#8220;lunatiks&#8221; at Bedlam Asylum to the infamous eugenics era to the follies of the anti-psychiatry movement to the current landscape in which too many families struggle alone to manage afflicted love ones, Powers limns our fears and myths about mental illness and the fractured public policies that have resulted.     </p>
<p>                    Braided with that history is the moving story of Powers&#8217;s beloved son Kevin&#8211;spirited, endearing, and gifted&#8211;who triumphed even while suffering from schizophrenia until finally he did not, and the story of his courageous surviving son Dean, who is also schizophrenic.     </p>
<p>                    A blend of history, biography, memoir, and current affairs ending with a consideration of where we might go from here, this is a thought-provoking look at a dreaded illness that has long been misunderstood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A book to savour, to practise, and take to heart&#8217; Professor Mark Williams    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As clear and inspired as it gets&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Four steps to counterbalance your brain&#8217;s negativity bias and learn to hardwire happiness in only a few minutes each day.     </p>
<p>                    Recent scientific breakthroughs have revealed that what we think and feel changes the brain. Dr Rick Hanson&#8217;s Hardwiring Happiness is the first book to show how to transform the simple positive experiences of daily life into neural structures that promote lasting health, contentment, love and inner peace.     </p>
<p>                     To keep our ancestors alive, our brain evolved a &#8216;negativity bias&#8217;, which lets positive experiences flow through it like water through a sieve. Yet positive experiences are the building blocks needed for health, happiness and fulfilling relationships. Drawing on neuroscience and the contemplative traditions, Hardwiring Happiness shows how to overcome that negativity bias and get those good experiences into the brain where it can use them, providing the tools we need to heal old wounds, develop our inner resources and, ultimately, transform our lives.</p>
