										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So much goes unnoticed. We multi-task, switch between screens, work faster. When was the last time you paused to consider a beautifully made object or stunning natural landscape? Yet this is when our spirits lift, our soul is restored. Designer Alan Moore invites us to rethink not only what we produce &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a website, a handmade chair, or a business &#8211; but how and why. With examples including Pixar, Apple, and Blitz Motorcycles, we are encouraged to ask: Is it useful and considered. Is it a thing of beauty? Do Design will inspire you to:<br />
                    &#8211; Improve your creative process<br />
                    &#8211; Raise the quality and craft of your work<br />
                    &#8211; Consider the experience as much as the product<br />
                    &#8211; Adopt simplicity, utility and honesty as guiding principles We are creative beings. We love to make things. This book will inspire you to create better things, for better reasons. Things that people will love &#8211; for a long time to come. Some say beauty is a luxury. But what if it is key to creating a better world for us all?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is crazy. Creative work is hard. And nothing is getting any easier!    </p>
<p>                    In his previous books &#8211; Steal Like an Artistand Show Your Work!, New York Times bestsellers with over a million copies in print combined &#8211; Austin Kleon gave readers the key to unlock their creativity and then showed them how to share it. Now he completes his trilogy with his most inspiring work yet.    </p>
<p>                    Keep Going gives the reader life-changing, illustrated advice and encouragement on how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself in the face of personal burnout or external distractions. Here is how to Build a Bliss Station &#8211; a place or fixed period where you can disconnect from the world. How to see that Every Day Is Groundhog Day &#8211; yesterday&#8217;s over, tomorrow may never come, so just do what you can do today. How to Forget the Noun, Do the Verb &#8211; stop worrying about being a &#8220;painter&#8221; and just paint.    </p>
<p>                    Keep working. Keep playing. Keep searching. Keep giving. Keep living. Keep Going. It&#8217;s exactly the message all of us need, at exactly the right time.</p>
