										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if the new far right poses a graver threat to liberal democracy than jihadists or mass migration?    </p>
<p>                    From Europe to the United States and beyond, opportunistic politicians have exploited economic crisis, terrorist attacks and an influx of refugees to bring hateful and reactionary views from the margins of political discourse into the corridors of power. This climate has already helped propel Donald Trump to the White House, pushed Britain out of the European Union, and put Marine Le Pen within striking distance of the French presidency.    </p>
<p>                    Sasha Polakow-Suransky&#8217;s on-the-ground reportage and interviews with the rising stars of the new right tell the story of how we got here, tracing the global rise of anti-immigration politics and the ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe&#8217;s new far right as defenders of Western liberal values.    </p>
<p>                    Go Back to Where You Came From is an indispensable account of why xenophobia went mainstream in countries known historically as defenders of human rights and models of tolerance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this powerful and emotional New York Times bestseller, Nobel Peace Prize winner and activist Malala Yousafzai shares various stories of displacement, including her own. Part memoir, part communal storytelling, We Are Displaced introduces readers to some of the incredible girls Malala has met on her many journeys and lets each tell her story &#8211; girls who have lost their community, relatives and often the only world they&#8217;ve ever known, but have not lost hope.    </p>
<p>                    Longing for home and fear of an uncertain future binds all of these young women, but each is unique. In a time of immigration crises, war and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder that every single one of the 79.5 million currently displaced is a person &#8211; often a young person &#8211; with dreams for a better, safer world.    </p>
<p>                    Includes a new Afterword by the author</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frontier Justice is a gripping exploration of the world-wide refugee crisis. Andy Lamey presents the story behind the radical increase in the global number of asylum-seekers, set within the historical and philosophical context in which the ideas of asylum originated and evolved.    Importantly, Lamey approaches the issue as a global one, presenting case studies from Australia, North America, and Europe He follows the extraordinary efforts of a set of Yale law students who sued the U.S. government on behalf of a group of refugees imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay; he recounts one refugee family&#8217;s harrowing journey from Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Iraq to contemporary Australia via the world&#8217;s most dangerous ocean crossing; and he explores the fascinating case of Ahmed Ressam, the so-called Millennium bomber who filed a refugee claim in Canada before attempting to blow up the Los Angeles airport.   Throughout Lamey&#8217;s account, he focuses on the rights of people in search of asylum, and how those rights are routinely violated. But Frontier Justice does not merely point out problems. At the      heart of the book is a new blueprint for how the rights of refugees might be enforced, and a vision of human rights that is ultimately optimistic and deeply affirmative.</p>
