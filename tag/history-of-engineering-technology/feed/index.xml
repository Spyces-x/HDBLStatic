										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roughly half the world&#8217;s population speaks languages derived from a shared linguistic source known as Proto-Indo-European. But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, and how did they manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization. Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia&#8217;s steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior&#8217;s chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange.<br />
                    He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper mining, warfare, and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries&#8211;the source of the Indo-European languages and English&#8211;and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tracy Kidder&#8217;s &#8220;riveting&#8221; (Washington Post) story of one company&#8217;s efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and has become essential reading for understanding the history of the American tech industry.  Computers have changed since 1981, when The Soul of a New Machine first examined the culture of the computer revolution. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations.<br />
                    The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century. &#8220;Fascinating&#8230;A surprisingly gripping account of people at work.&#8221; &#8211;Wall Street Journal    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Best Book of the Year:<br />
                    Mother Jones &#8211; Bloomberg News &#8211; National Post &#8211; Kirkus      </p>
<p>                     In these pages, Nicholas Basbanes&#8211;the consummate bibliophile&#8217;s bibliophile&#8211;shows how paper has been civilization&#8217;s constant companion. It preserves our history and gives record to our very finest literary, cultural, and scientific accomplishments. Since its invention in China nearly two millennia ago, the technology of paper has spread throughout the inhabited world.     </p>
<p>                    With deep knowledge and care, Basbanes traces paper&#8217;s trail from the earliest handmade sheets to the modern-day mills. Paper, yoked to politics, has played a crucial role in the unfolding of landmark events, from the American Revolution to Daniel Ellsberg&#8217;s Pentagon Papers to the aftermath of 9/11. Without paper, modern hygienic practice would be unimaginable; as currency, people will do almost anything to possess it; and, as a tool of expression, it is inextricable from human culture. Lavishly researched, compellingly written, this masterful guide illuminates paper&#8217;s endless possibilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revelatory look at our national power grid&#8211;how it developed, its current flaws, and how it must be completely reimagined for our fast-approaching energy future.     </p>
<p>                    America&#8217;s electrical grid, an engineering triumph of the twentieth century, is turning out to be a poor fit for the present. It&#8217;s not just that the grid has grown old and is now in dire need of basic repair. Today, as we invest great hope in new energy sources&#8211;solar, wind, and other alternatives&#8211;the grid is what stands most firmly in the way of a brighter energy future. If we hope to realize this future, we need to reimagine the grid according to twenty-first-century values. It&#8217;s a project which forces visionaries to work with bureaucrats, legislators with storm-flattened communities, moneymen with hippies, and the left with the right. And though it might not yet be obvious, this revolution is already well under way.     </p>
<p>                     Cultural anthropologist Gretchen Bakke unveils the many facets of America&#8217;s energy infrastructure, its most dynamic moments and its most stable ones, and its essential role in personal and national life. The grid, she argues, is an essentially American artifact, one which developed with us: a product of bold expansion, the occasional foolhardy vision, some genius technologies, and constant improvisation. Most of all, her focus is on how Americans are changing the grid right now, sometimes with gumption and big dreams and sometimes with legislation or the brandishing of guns.     </p>
<p>                    The Grid tells&#8211;entertainingly, perceptively&#8211;the story of what has been called the largest machine in the world: its fascinating history, its problematic present, and its potential role in a brighter, cleaner future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on unprecedented access to the corporation&#8217;s archives, The Intel Trinity is the first full history of Intel Corporation-the essential company of the digital age- told through the lives of the three most important figures in the company&#8217;s history: Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove.  Often hailed the &#8220;most important company in the world,&#8221; Intel remains, more than four decades after its inception, a defining company of the global digital economy. The legendary inventors of the microprocessor-the single most important product in the modern world-Intel today builds the tiny &#8220;engines&#8221; that power almost every intelligent electronic device on the planet.  But the true story of Intel is the human story of the trio of geniuses behind it. Michael S. Malone reveals how each brought different things to Intel, and at different times. Noyce, the most respected high tech figure of his generation, brought credibility (and money) to the company&#8217;s founding; Moore made Intel the world&#8217;s technological leader; and Grove, has relentlessly driven the company to ever-higher levels of success and competitiveness.<br />
                    Without any one of these figures, Intel would never have achieved its historic success; with them, Intel made possible the personal computer, Internet, telecommunications, and the personal electronics revolutions.  The Intel Trinity is not just the story of Intel&#8217;s legendary past; it also offers an analysis of the formidable challenges that lie ahead as the company struggles to maintain its dominance, its culture, and its legacy.  With eight pages of black-and-white photos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firebrand conservative columnist, commentator, Internet entrepreneur, and #1 New York Times bestselling author Michelle Malkin tells the fascinating, little-known stories of the inventors who have contributed to American exceptionalism and technological progress.     </p>
<p>                    Call them America&#8217;s &#8220;tinkerpreneurs&#8221;&#8211;unsung innovators who commercialized their &#8220;little&#8221; ideas to create products, companies, wealth, and opportunities that thrive today. Tireless, self-made, and largely self-taught, they raised our standard of living with the creation of items we daily take for granted, from razors to bottle caps, flashlights to bridge cables.     </p>
<p>                    This entertaining and enlightening treasury is, in part, Michelle Malkin&#8217;s response to President Obama&#8217;s infamous assertion that &#8220;if you&#8217;ve got a business, you didn&#8217;t build that.&#8221; She examines how factors such as profit motive, intellectual property rights, patriotism, faith, family, and an unwavering belief in American exceptionalism set the stage for the creation of toilet paper, glass bottles, the hydroelectric power plant, and more.     </p>
<p>                    Demonized by the left as greedy villains and selfish barons, these visionaries have nurtured job-creating powerhouses used today by &#8220;progressive&#8221; propagandists who can&#8217;t comprehend how much comfort and convenience they enjoy as a result of the ingenious contributions by these original American dreamers. Are they rich? You bet. They earned their private rewards for the public good. Find out Who Built That&#8211;and the next time you turn on your air conditioner, say thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An automotive and tech world insider investigates the quest to develop and perfect the driverless car&#8211;an innovation that promises to be the most disruptive change to our way of life since the smartphone    </p>
<p>                    We stand on the brink of a technological revolution. Soon, few of us will own our own automobiles and instead will get around in driverless electric vehicles that we summon with the touch of an app. We will be liberated from driving, prevent over 90% of car crashes, provide freedom of mobility to the elderly and disabled, and decrease our dependence on fossil fuels.     </p>
<p>                    Autonomy is the story of the maverick engineers and computer nerds who are creating the revolution. Longtime advisor to the Google Self-Driving Car team and former GM research and development chief Lawrence D. Burns provides the perfectly-timed history of how we arrived at this point, in a character-driven and heavily reported account of the unlikely thinkers who accomplished what billion-dollar automakers never dared.    </p>
<p>                    Beginning with the way 9/11 spurred the U.S. government to set a million-dollar prize for a series of off-road robot races in the Mojave Desert up to the early 2016 stampede to develop driverless technology, Autonomy is a page-turner that represents a chronicle of the past, diagnosis of the present, and prediction of the future&#8211;the ultimate guide to understanding the driverless car and navigating the revolution it sparks.</p>

Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women&#8211;known as &#8220;human computers&#8221;&#8211;who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews, Nathalia Holt offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we&#8217;ve been, and the far reaches of space to which we&#8217;re heading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT&#038;T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it&#8217;s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn&#8217;t been touched by Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century&#8217;s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In April 1956, a refitted oil tanker carried fifty-eight shipping containers from Newark to Houston. From that modest beginning, container shipping developed into a huge industry that made the boom in global trade possible. The Box tells the dramatic story of the container&#8217;s creation, the decade of struggle before it was widely adopted, and the sweeping economic consequences of the sharp fall in transportation costs that containerization brought about. But the container didn&#8217;t just happen. Its adoption required huge sums of money, both from private investors and from ports that aspired to be on the leading edge of a new technology. It required years of high-stakes bargaining with two of the titans of organized labor, Harry Bridges and Teddy Gleason, as well as delicate negotiations on standards that made it possible for almost any container to travel on any truck or train or ship. Ultimately, it took McLean&#8217;s success in supplying U.S. forces in Vietnam to persuade the world of the container&#8217;s potential.<br />
                    Drawing on previously neglected sources, economist Marc Levinson shows how the container transformed economic geography, devastating traditional ports such as New York and London and fueling the growth of previously obscure ones, such as Oakland. By making shipping so cheap that industry could locate factories far from its customers, the container paved the way for Asia to become the world&#8217;s workshop and brought consumers a previously unimaginable variety of low-cost products from around the globe. Published in hardcover on the fiftieth anniversary of the first container voyage, this is the first comprehensive history of the shipping container. Now with a new chapter, The Box tells the dramatic story of how the drive and imagination of an iconoclastic entrepreneur turned containerization from an impractical idea into a phenomenon that transformed economic geography, slashed transportation costs, and made the boom in global trade possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the face of today&#8217;s environmental and economic challenges, doomsayers preach that the only way to stave off disaster is for humans to reverse course: to de-industrialize, re-localize, ban the use of modern energy sources, and forswear prosperity. But in this provocative and optimistic rebuke to the catastrophists, Robert Bryce shows how innovation and the inexorable human desire to make things Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper is providing consumers with Cheaper and more abundant energy, Faster computing, Lighter vehicles, and myriad other goods. That same desire is fostering unprecedented prosperity, greater liberty, and yes, better environmental protection.Utilizing on-the-ground reporting from Ottawa to Panama City and Pittsburgh to Bakersfield, Bryce shows how we have, for centuries, been pushing for Smaller Faster solutions to our problems. From the vacuum tube, mass-produced fertilizer, and the printing press to mobile phones, nanotech, and advanced drill rigs, Bryce demonstrates how cutting-edge companies and breakthrough technologies have created a world in which people are living longer, freer, healthier, lives than at any time in human history.The push toward Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper is happening across multiple sectors. Bryce profiles innovative individuals and companies, from long-established ones like Ford and Intel to upstarts like Aquion Energy and Khan Academy. And he zeroes in on the energy industry, proving that the future belongs to the high power density sources that can provide the enormous quantities of energy the world demands.The tools we need to save the planet aren&#8217;t to be found in the technologies or lifestyles of the past. Nor must we sacrifice prosperity and human progress to ensure our survival. The catastrophists have been wrong since the days of Thomas Malthus. This is the time to embrace the innovators and businesses all over the world who are making things Smaller Faster Lighter Denser Cheaper.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world today,from the phone in your pocket to the car that you drive, the allure of social media to the strategy of the Pentagon,has been shaped irrevocably by the technology of silicon transistors. Year after year, for half a century, these tiny switches have enabled ever-more startling capabilities. Their incredible proliferation has altered the course of human history as dramatically as any political or social revolution. At the heart of it all has been one quiet Californian: Gordon Moore.At Fairchild Semiconductor, his seminal Silicon Valley startup, Moore,a young chemist turned electronics entrepreneur,had the defining insight: silicon transistors, and microchips made of them, could make electronics profoundly cheap and immensely powerful. Microchips could double in power, then redouble again in clockwork fashion. History has borne out this insight, which we now call  Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221;, and Moore himself, having recognized it, worked endlessly to realize his vision. With Moore&#8217;s technological leadership at Fairchild and then at his second start-up, the Intel Corporation, the law has held for fifty years. The result is profound: from the days of enormous, clunky computers of limited capability to our new era, in which computers are placed everywhere from inside of our bodies to the surface of Mars.Moore led nothing short of a revolution. In  Moore&#8217;s Law , Arnold Thackray, David C. Brock, and Rachel Jones give the authoritative account of Gordon Moore&#8217;s life and his role in the development both of Silicon Valley and the transformative technologies developed there. Told by a team of writers with unparalleled access to Moore, his family, and his contemporaries, this is the human story of man and a career that have had almost superhuman effects. The history of twentieth-century technology is littered with overblown  revolutions.&#8221;  Moore&#8217;s Law  is essential reading for anyone seeking to learn what a real revolution looks like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How much further should the affluent world push its material consumption? Does relative dematerialization lead to absolute decline in demand for materials?  These and many other questions are discussed and answered in Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization. Over the course of time, the modern world has become dependent on unprecedented flows of materials. Now even the most efficient production processes and the highest practical rates of recycling may not be enough to result in dematerialization rates that would be high enough to negate the rising demand for materials generated by continuing population growth and rising standards of living. This book explores the costs of this dependence and the potential for substantial dematerialization of modern economies. Making the Modern World: Materials and Dematerialization considers the principal materials used throughout history, from wood and stone, through to metals, alloys, plastics and silicon, describing their extraction and production as well as their dominant applications.<br />
                    The evolving productivities of material extraction, processing, synthesis, finishing and distribution, and the energy costs and environmental impact of rising material consumption are examined in detail. The book concludes with an outlook for the future, discussing the prospects for dematerialization and potential constrains on materials. This interdisciplinary text provides useful perspectives for readers with backgrounds including resource economics, environmental studies, energy analysis, mineral geology, industrial organization, manufacturing and material science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BY THE WINNER OF THE 2020 NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A powerful mix of science and ethics . . . This book is required reading for every concerned citizen&#8211;the material it covers should be discussed in schools, colleges, and universities throughout the country.&#8221;&#8211; New York Review of Books      </p>
<p>                     Not since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world about its use. That is, until 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR&#8211;a revolutionary new technology that she helped create&#8211;to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, most effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic diseases, and some cancers. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA could have myriad, unforeseeable consequences, to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of intentionally mutating embryos to create &#8220;better&#8221; humans. Writing with fellow researcher Sam Sternberg, Doudna&#8211;who has since won the Nobel Prize for her CRISPR research&#8211;shares the thrilling story of her discovery and describes the enormous responsibility that comes with the power to rewrite the code of life.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The future is in our hands as never before, and this book explains the stakes like no other.&#8221; &#8212; George Lucas     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An invaluable account . . . We owe Doudna several times over.&#8221; &#8212; Guardian</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isaac Newton was born in a stone farmhouse in 1642, fatherless and unwanted by his mother. When he died in London in 1727 he was so renowned he was given a state funeral&#8211;an unheard-of honor for a subject whose achievements were in the realm of the intellect. During the years he was an irascible presence at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton imagined properties of nature and gave them names&#8211;mass, gravity, velocity&#8211;things our science now takes for granted. Inspired by Aristotle, spurred on by Galileo&#8217;s discoveries and the philosophy of Descartes, Newton grasped the intangible and dared to take its measure, a leap of the mind unparalleled in his generation. James Gleick, the author of Chaos and Genius, and one of the most acclaimed science writers of his generation, brings the reader into Newton&#8217;s reclusive life and provides startlingly clear explanations of the concepts that changed forever our perception of bodies, rest, and motion&#8211;ideas so basic to the twenty-first century, it can truly be said: We are all Newtonians.</p>

<p>                    In sharply argued, fast-moving chapters, Cory Doctorow&#8217;s Information Doesn&#8217;t Want to Be Free takes on the state of copyright and creative success in the digital age. Can small artists still thrive in the Internet era? Can giant record labels avoid alienating their audiences? This is a book about the pitfalls, and the opportunities, creative industries (and individuals) are confronting today&#8211;about how the old models have failed or found new footing, and about what might soon replace them. An essential read for anyone with a stake in the future of the arts, Information Doesn&#8217;t Want to Be Free offers a vivid guide to the ways creativity and the Internet interact today, and to what might be coming next.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Pollan keeps you turning the pages . . . cleareyed and assured.&#8221; -New York Times</p>
<p>A #1 New York Times Bestseller, New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2018, and New York Times Notable Book</p>
<p>A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs&#8211;and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists.  Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.</p>
<p>A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan&#8217;s &#8220;mental travelogue&#8221; is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.</p>
