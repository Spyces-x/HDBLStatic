										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavioral economist and New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our general behaviour, up close and personal.    </p>
<p>                              In The Upside of Irrationality, behavioral economist Dan Ariely will explore the many ways in which our behaviour often leads us astray in terms of our romantic relationships, our experiences in the workplace, and our temptations to cheat. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.    </p>
<p>                              Among the topics Dan explores are:<br />
                    * What we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy;<br />
                    * How we learn to love the ones we are with;<br />
                    * Why online dating doesn&#8217;t work, and how we can improve on it;<br />
                    * Why learning more about people make us like them less;<br />
                    * Why large bonuses can make CEOs less productive;<br />
                    * How to really motivate people at work;<br />
                    * Why bad directions can help us;<br />
                    * How we fall in love with our ideas;<br />
                    * How we are motivated by revenge; and<br />
                    * What motivates us to cheat.    </p>
<p>                              Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational such a hit, Dan will emphasize the important role that irrationality plays in our day-to-day decisionmaking-not just in our financial marketplace, but in the most hidden aspects of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenal international bestseller that shows us how to stop trying to predict everything &#8211; and take advantage of uncertainty    </p>
<p>                    What have the invention of the wheel, Pompeii, the Wall Street Crash, Harry Potter and the internet got in common? Why are all forecasters  con-artists? Why should you never run for a train or read a newspaper?     </p>
<p>                    This book is all about Black Swans: the random events that underlie our lives, from bestsellers to world disasters. Their impact is huge; they&#8217;re impossible to predict; yet after they happen we always try to rationalize them.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Taleb is a bouncy and even exhilarating  guide &#8230; I came to relish what he said, and even develop a sneaking affection for him as a person&#8217; Will Self, Independent on Sunday    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hugely influential book on how the understanding of causality revolutionized science and the world, by the pioneer of artificial intelligence    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Wonderful &#8230; illuminating and fun to read&#8217; Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize-winner and author of Thinking, Fast and Slow    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Correlation  does not imply causation.&#8217; For decades, this mantra was invoked by scientists in order to avoid taking positions as to whether one thing  caused another, such as smoking and cancer, or carbon dioxide and global  warming. But today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, sparked  by world-renowned computer scientist Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has  cut through a century of confusion and placed cause and effect on a  firm scientific basis. Now, Pearl and science journalist Dana Mackenzie explain causal thinking to general readers for the first time, showing  how it allows us to explore the world that is and the worlds that could  have been. It is the essence of human and artificial intelligence. And  just as Pearl&#8217;s discoveries have enabled machines to think better, The  Book of Why explains how we too can think better.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Pearl&#8217;s accomplishments over the last 30 years have provided the theoretical basis for progress in artificial intelligence and have redefined the term &#8220;thinking machine&#8221;&#8216; Vint Cerf</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creator and host of the podcast The Gratitude Diaries and New York Times bestselling author Janice Kaplan examines the phenomenon of luck&#8211;and discovers the exciting ways you can grab opportunities and make luck for yourself every day.  After spending a year researching and experiencing gratitude for The Gratitude Diaries, Janice Kaplan is back to tackle another big, mysterious influence in all our lives: luck. And this time she&#8217;s joined on her journey by coauthor Dr. Barnaby Marsh, a renowned academic who guides her exploration. Together they uncover the unexpected, little-understood science behind what we call luck, proving that many seemingly random events are actually under your&#8211;and everyone&#8217;s&#8211;control. They examine the factors that made stars like Harrison Ford and Jonathan Groff so successful, and learn the real secrets that made Kate Spade and Warby Parker into global brands. Using original research, fascinating studies, and engaging interviews, Kaplan and Marsh reveal the simple techniques to create luck in love and marriage, business and career, and health, happiness, and family relationships. Their breakthrough insights prove that all of us&#8211;from CEOs to stay-at-home moms&#8211;can tip the scales of fortune in our favor. Through a mix of scientific research, conversations with famous and successful people&#8211;from academics like Dan Ariely and Leonard Mlodinow to actor Josh Groban&#8211;and powerful narrative, How Luck Happens uncovers a fascinating subject in accessible and entertaining style.</p>

<p>                    An international sensation&#8211;and still the talk of the relevant blogosphere&#8211;this Wall Street Journal and New York Times business bestseller examines the &#8220;power&#8221; in numbers. Today more than ever, number crunching affects your life in ways you might not even imagine. Intuition and experience are no longer enough to make the grade.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life, a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns&#8211;from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage&#8211;behind the rituals of love.     </p>
<p>                    The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that mathematics isn&#8217;t a crucial tool for understanding love.     </p>
<p>                    Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. And mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns&#8211;from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as the rituals of love do.     </p>
<p>                    In The Mathematics of Love, Dr. Hannah Fry takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What&#8217;s the chance of finding love? What&#8217;s the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide who to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down?     </p>
<p>                    From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves&#8211;with great insight, wit, and fun&#8211;that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A statistical national treasure&#8217; Jeremy Vine, BBC Radio 2    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Required reading for all politicians, journalists, medics and anyone who tries to influence people (or is influenced) by statistics. A tour de force&#8217; Popular Science    </p>
<p>                    Do busier hospitals have higher survival rates? How many trees are there on the planet? Why do old men have big ears? David Spiegelhalter reveals the answers to these and many other questions &#8211; questions that can only be addressed using statistical science.    </p>
<p>                    Statistics has played a leading role in our scientific understanding of the world for centuries, yet we are all familiar with the way statistical claims can be sensationalised, particularly in the media. In the age of big data, as data science becomes established as a discipline, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever.     </p>
<p>                    In The Art of Statistics, David Spiegelhalter guides the reader through the essential principles we need in order to derive knowledge from data. Drawing on real world problems to introduce conceptual issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether serial killer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Shines a light on how we can use the ever-growing deluge of data to improve our understanding of the world&#8217; Nature</p>

<p>                    We live in a world where the line between truth and lies is increasingly blurred by euphemistic terms such as &#8216;post-truth&#8217;, &#8216;counter-knowledge&#8217;, &#8216;fringe theories&#8217; and others. In a world where anyone can become an expert at the click of a button, we&#8217;re worse equipped than ever to evaluate the  information we encounter and separate the truth from the lies.  Daniel Levitin debunks the idea that truth no longer exists, and shows that we urgently need to learn the skills toeffectively ask ourselves: can we really know that? And how do they know that?     </p>
<p>                    In this eye-opening, accessible guide filled with fascinating examples and practical takeaways, acclaimed neuroscientist Daniel Levitin shows us how learning to understand statistics will enable you to make better, smarter judgements on the world around you.</p>

<p>                    Every time we choose a route to work, decide whether to go on a second  date, or set aside money for a rainy day, we are making a prediction  about the future. Yet from the financial crisis to ecological disasters,  we routinely fail to foresee hugely significant events, often at great  cost to society. The rise of &#8216;big data&#8217; has the potential to help us  predict the future, yet much of it is misleading, useless or  distracting.    </p>
<p>                    In The Signal and the Noise, the New York Times  political forecaster Nate Silver, who accurately predicted the results  of every state in the 2012 US election, reveals how we can all develop  better foresight in an uncertain world. From the stock market to the  poker table, from earthquakes to the economy, he takes us on an  enthralling insider&#8217;s tour of the high-stakes world of forecasting,  showing how we can all learn to detect the true signals amid a noise of  data.    </p>

                    How long will your kids wait in line at Disney World?Who decides that &#8220;standardized tests&#8221; are fair?Why do highway engineers build slow-moving ramps?What does it mean, statistically, to be an &#8220;Average Joe&#8221;?NUMBERS RULE YOUR WORLD<br />

These are the statistics that rule your life, your job, your commute, your vacation, your food, your health, your money, and your success.

But there&#8217;s one thing you won&#8217;t be able to deny: Numbers Rule Your World&#8230;&#8221;An easy read with a big benefit.&#8221;<br />

                     &#8220;A book that engages us with stories that a journalist would write, the compelling stories behind the stories as illuminated by the numbers, and the dynamics that the numbers reveal.&#8221;<br />
                    -John Sall, Executive Vice President, SAS Institute  &#8220;Little did I suspect, when I picked up Kaiser Fung&#8217;s book, that I would become so entranced by it &#8211; an illuminating and accessible exploration of the power of statistical analysis for those of us who have no prior training in a field that he explores so ably.&#8221;<br />
                    -Peter Clarke, author of  Keynes: The Rise, Fall, and Return of the 20th Century&#8217;s Most Influential Economist    </p>

If you want to understand how to use statistics, how to think with numbers and yet to do this without getting lost in equations, if you&#8217;ve been looking for the book to unlock the door to logical thinking about problems, well, you will be pleased to know that you are holding that book in your hands.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are the safest humans who ever lived &#8211; the statistics prove it. And yet the media tells a different story with its warnings and scare stories. How is it possible that anxiety has become the stuff of daily life?    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking, compulsively readable book, Dan Gardner shows how our flawed strategies for perceiving risk influence our lives, often with unforeseen and sometimes-tragic consequences. He throws light on our paranoia about everything from paedophiles to terrorism and reveals how the most significant threats are actually the mundane risks to which we pay little attention.    </p>
<p>                    Speaking to psychologists and scientists, as well as looking at the influence of the media and politicians, Gardner uncovers one of the central puzzles of our time: why are the safest people in history living in a culture of fear?</p>
