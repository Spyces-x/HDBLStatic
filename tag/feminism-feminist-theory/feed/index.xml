										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a fierce and humorous new voice comes a relevant, insightful, and riveting collection of personal essays on the richness and resilience of black girl culture&#8211;for readers of Samantha Irby, Roxane Gay, Morgan Jerkins, and Lindy West.     </p>
<p>                    Shayla Lawson is major. You don&#8217;t know who she is. Yet. But that&#8217;s okay. She is on a mission to move black girls like herself from best supporting actress to a starring role in the major narrative. Whether she&#8217;s taking on workplace microaggressions or upending racist stereotypes about her home state of Kentucky, she looks for the side of the story that isn&#8217;t always told, the places where the voices of black girls haven&#8217;t been heard.     </p>
<p>                    The essays in This is Major ask questions like: Why are black women invisible to AI? What is &#8220;black girl magic&#8221;? Or: Am I one viral tweet away from becoming Twitter famous? And: How much magic does it take to land a Tinder date?    </p>
<p>                    With a unique mix of personal stories, pop culture observations, and insights into politics and history, Lawson sheds light on these questions, as well as the many ways black women and girls have influenced mainstream culture&#8211;from their style, to their language, and even their art&#8211;and how &#8220;major&#8221; they really are.    </p>
<p>                    Timely, enlightening, and wickedly sharp, This Is Major places black women at the center&#8211;no longer silenced, no longer the minority.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;A life-transforming book&#8230; fascinating &#8211; Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Maisie Hill has written a bloody brilliant book (pun intended). Everything you need to know about periods and how they affect you and your life is here. It&#8217;s revolutionary&#8217; &#8211; Miranda Sawyer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thank GOODNESS for Maisie Hill! Flipping open the lid on a vital conversation. It&#8217;s about time we claimed the power of our periods!&#8217; &#8211; Gemma Cairney, broadcaster &#038; co-founder of Boom Shakalaka Productions    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is such an important book. Maisie&#8217;s insights and cycle strategy have changed my life and my cycle. Period Power is written with such intelligence, humour and a deep understanding of women&#8217;s health. If you have a period you need to read this book.&#8217; &#8211; Anna Jones, author of The Modern Cook&#8217;s Year    </p>
<p>                    A profound and practical blueprint for aligning daily life with your menstrual cycle.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is the handbook to periods and hormones that will leave you wondering why the hell nobody told you this sooner.    </p>
<p>                    The hormones of the menstrual cycle profoundly influence our energy, mood and behaviour, but all too often we&#8217;re taught that our hormones make us unreliable, moody bitches, or that it&#8217;s our lot in life to put up with &#8216;women&#8217;s problems&#8217;. Maisie Hill, a women&#8217;s health practitioner, knows the power of working with the menstrual cycle and refuses to accept this theory. Instead, Maisie believes that our hormones are there to serve us and, if utilized correctly, can be used to help you get what you want out of life. Yes, we are hormonal, and that&#8217;s a very good thing.    </p>
<p>                    This revolutionary book reveals everything you need to know about taking control of your menstrual cycle and outlines The Cycle Strategy to help us perform at our best, throughout our cycle. In Period Power you will discover how to:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; maximise your natural superpowers each month while making adjustments for the darker days, and use Maisie&#8217;s favourite tips to improve them<br />
                    &#8211; identify your personal patterns, powers and pitfalls for each phase of the menstrual cycle<br />
                    &#8211; plan your month to perform at your best in all aspects of your life<br />
                    &#8211; figure out if you have a hormonal imbalance and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is a no-nonsense guide with all the tools you need to improve your menstrual health.</p>

<p>                    The instant New York Times bestseller from the author of Reviving Ophelia&#8211;a guide to wisdom, authenticity, and bliss for women as they age.     </p>
<p>                    Women growing older contend with ageism, misogyny, and loss. Yet as Mary Pipher shows, most older women are deeply happy and filled with gratitude for the gifts of life. Their struggles help them grow into the authentic, empathetic, and wise people they have always wanted to be.     </p>
<p>                    In Women Rowing North, Pipher offers a timely examination of the cultural and developmental issues women face as they age. Drawing on her own experience as daughter, sister, mother, grandmother, caregiver, clinical psychologist, and cultural anthropologist, she explores ways women can cultivate resilient responses to the challenges they face. &#8220;If we can keep our wits about us, think clearly, and manage our emotions skillfully,&#8221; Pipher writes, &#8220;we will experience a joyous time of our lives. If we have planned carefully and packed properly, if we have good maps and guides, the journey can be transcendent.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this classic study, cultural critic bell hooks examines how black women, from the seventeenth century to the present day, were and are oppressed by both white men and black men and by white women.     </p>
<p>                    Illustrating her analysis with moving personal accounts, Ain&#8217;t I a Woman is deeply critical of the racism inherent in the thought of many middle-class white feminists who have failed to address issues of race and class.     </p>
<p>                    While acknowledging the conflict of loyalty to race or sex is still a dilemma, hooks challenges the view that race and gender are two separate phenomena, insisting that the struggles to end racism and sexism are inextricably intertwined.</p>

And whether that&#8217;s a football star, beloved celebrity, elected official, member of the clergy, or just an average Joe (or Joanna), there&#8217;s probably a community eager to make excuses for that person.In  Asking for It , Kate Harding combines in-depth research with an in-your-face voice to make the case that twenty-first-century America supports rapists more effectively than it supports victims. Drawing on real-world examples of what feminists call &#8220;rape culture&#8221;,from politicos&#8217; revealing gaffes to institutional failures in higher education and the military,Harding offers ideas and suggestions for how we, as a society, can take sexual violence much more seriously without compromising the rights of the accused.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shocking, heartfelt and well-researched&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A ground-shaping book that defines the edge of so many vital contemporary debates. Hers is a voice simultaneously behind and beyond the veil&#8217; Colum McCann    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating, can&#8217;t-look-away, whistle-stop tour of the Middle East&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>

<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens explodes the myth that we should stand back and watch while women are disempowered and abused in the name of religion.    </p>
<p>                     In this laceratingly honest account, Eltahawy takes aim both at attitudes in the Middle East and at the western liberals who mistake misogyny for cultural difference. Her argument is clear: unless political revolution in the Arab world is accompanied by social and sexual revolution, no progress will be made.    </p>
<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens is the book the world has been crying out for: a powerful, fearless account of what it really means to be a woman in the Muslim world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT is an empowering letter from former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri to the first woman president, and by extension, to all women working to succeed in any field.     </p>
<p>                    By using lessons learned during her experiences with Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and Elizabeth Edwards &#8211; to name a few &#8211; Palmieri through each chapter creates a forward-thinking framework of inspirational and practical advice for all women everywhere &#8211; from boardrooms to living rooms &#8211; who are determined to seize control of their lives, their workplaces, and their country. DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT will turn the results of the 2016 election into something incredibly empowering for future female leaders and independent thinkers everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    We haven&#8217;t wrapped our heads around what it should look like for a woman to be in the job of President. Our only models are men. This of course was seen during the Hillary Clinton campaign, and no one knows this better than Jennifer Palmieri. While wildly disappointed by the outcome of the election, Palmieri optimistically argues in the book that the Clinton candidacy and all she experienced on the campaign trail &#8211; confusion, admiration, hate, love, acceptance, rejection &#8211; can now open the country up to reimagining women in leadership roles. And that is what Palmieri takes on in this book &#8211; redefining expectations for women looking to lead and creating a blueprint for women candidates and leaders to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This riveting narrative explores the lives of six remarkable female pharaohs, from Hatshepsut to Cleopatra&#8211;women who ruled with real power&#8211;and shines a piercing light on our own perceptions of women in power today.    </p>
<p>                     Female rulers are a rare phenomenon&#8211;but thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt, women reigned supreme. Regularly, repeatedly, and with impunity, queens like Hatshepsut, Nefertiti, and Cleopatra controlled the totalitarian state as power-brokers and rulers. But throughout human history, women in positions of power were more often used as political pawns in a male-dominated society. What was so special about ancient Egypt that provided women this kind of access to the highest political office? What was it about these women that allowed them to transcend patriarchal obstacles? What did Egypt gain from its liberal reliance on female leadership, and could today&#8217;s world learn from its example?     </p>
<p>                      Celebrated Egyptologist Kara Cooney delivers a fascinating tale of female power, exploring the reasons why it has seldom been allowed through the ages, and why we should care.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Based on her inspiring, viral 2018 commencement speech to Barnard College&#8217;s graduates in New York City, New York Times bestselling author, two-time Olympic gold medallist and FIFA World Cup champion Abby Wambach delivers her empowering rally cry for women to unleash their individual power, unite with their pack, and emerge victorious together.    </p>
<p>                    Abby Wambach became a champion because of her incredible talent as a football player. She became an icon because of her remarkable wisdom as a leader. As the co-captain of the 2015 Women&#8217;s World Cup Champion Team, she created a culture not just of excellence, but of honour, commitment, resilience, and sisterhood. She helped transform a group of individual women into one of the most successful, powerful and united Wolfpacks of all time.    </p>
<p>                    In her retirement, Abby&#8217;s ready to do the same for her new team: All Women Everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    She insists that women must let go of old rules of leadership that neither include or serve them. She&#8217;s created a new set of Wolfpack rules to help women unleash their individual power, unite with their Wolfpack, and change the landscape of their lives and world.    </p>
<p>                    * Make failure your fuel: Transform failure to wisdom and power.<br />
                    * Lead from the bench: Lead from wherever you are.<br />
                    * Champion each other: Claim each woman&#8217;s victory as your own.<br />
                    * Demand the effing ball: Don&#8217;t ask permission: take what you&#8217;ve earned.    </p>
<p>                    In Abby&#8217;s vision, we are not Little Red Riding Hoods, staying on the path because we&#8217;re told to. We are the wolves, fighting for a better tomorrow for ourselves, our pack, and all the future wolves who will come after us.</p>

<p>                    WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ZOE WILLIAMS     </p>
<p>                    The term feminism did not yet exist when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote this book, but it was the first great piece of feminist writing. In these pages you will find the essence of her argument &#8211; for the education of women and for an increased female contribution to society. Her work made the first ripples of what would later become the tidal wave of the women&#8217;s rights movement. Rationalist but revolutionary, Wollstonecraft changed the world for women.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this time of great frustration, this collection is a clearing in the woods to meet, to reflect, to dance, and to cackle around the fire.&#8217;<br />
                    Abbi Jacobson, creator of Broad City and New York Times bestselling author of I Might Regret This    </p>
<p>                    From the moment powerful men started falling to the #MeToo movement, the lamentations began: this is feminism gone too far, this is injustice, this is a witch hunt. In The Witches Are Coming, firebrand author of the New York Times bestselling memoir and now critically acclaimed Hulu TV series Shrill, Lindy West, turns that refrain on its head. You think this is a witch hunt? Fine. You&#8217;ve got one.     </p>
<p>                    In a laugh-out-loud, incisive cultural critique, West unpacks the complicated, and sometimes tragic, politics of not being a white man in the twenty-first century. She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media that she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on our culture and our politics &#8211; and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.     </p>
<p>                    We cannot understand how we got here &#8211; how the land of the free became Trump&#8217;s America &#8211; without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact-checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and about each other. The truth can transform us; there is witchcraft in it. Lindy West turns on the light.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Lindy continues to be one of the funniest, smartest writers around.&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Roxane Gay is so great at weaving the intimate and personal with what is most bewildering and upsetting at this moment in culture. She is always looking, always thinking, always passionate, always careful, always right there.&#8221; &#8212; Sheila Heti, author of How Should a Person Be?    </p>
<p>                    A New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    Best Book of the Year: NPR &#8211; Boston Globe &#8211; Newsweek &#8211; Time Out New York &#8211; Oprah.com &#8211; Miami Herald &#8211; Book Riot &#8211; Buzz Feed &#8211; Globe and Mail (Toronto) &#8211; The Root &#8211; Shelf Awareness    </p>
<p>                    A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism from one of the most-watched cultural observers of her generation    </p>
<p>                    In these funny and insightful essays, Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of color (The Help) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.    </p>
<p>                    Bad Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better, coming from one of our most interesting and important cultural critics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A personal and powerful essay from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the bestselling author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun.    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;I would like to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently&#8230;&#8217;    </p>
<p>                              What does &#8220;feminism&#8221; mean today?    </p>
<p>                              In this personal, eloquently argued essay &#8211; adapted from her much-admired Tedx talk of the same name &#8211; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century, one rooted in inclusion and awareness. Drawing extensively on her own experiences and her deep understanding of the often masked realities of sexual politics, here is one remarkable author&#8217;s exploration of what it means to be a woman now &#8211; an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;necessary and incisive&#8221; (Roxane Gay) account of the discrimination case that &#8220;has blown open a conversation about the status of women&#8221; in the workplace (The New York Times) SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR &#8211; NAMED A BEST FALL BOOK BY ELLE AND BUSTLE  In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world&#8211;and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support&#8211;Time hailed her as &#8220;the face of change.&#8221; Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset,  she tells her full story for the first time.  The daughter of immigrants, Pao was taught that through hard work she could achieve her dreams. She earned multiple Ivy League degrees, worked at top startups, and in 2005 was recruited by Kleiner Perkins, arguably the world&#8217;s leading venture capital firm at the time. In many ways, she did everything right, and yet she and other women and people of color were excluded from success&#8211;cut out of decisive meetings and email discussions, uninvited to CEO dinners and lavish networking trips, and had their work undercut or appropriated by male executives. It was time for a system reset.  After Kleiner, Pao became CEO of reddit, where she took forceful action to change the status quo for the company and its product. She banned revenge porn and unauthorized nude photos&#8211;an action other large media sites later followed&#8211;and shut down parts of reddit over online harassment. She and seven other women tech leaders formed Project Include, an award-winning nonprofit for accelerating diversity and inclusion in tech. In her book, Pao shines a light on troubling issues that plague today&#8217;s workplace and lays out practical, inspiring, and achievable goals for a better future.  Ellen K. Pao&#8217;s Reset is a rallying cry&#8211;the story of a whistleblower who aims to empower everyone struggling to be heard, in Silicon Valley and beyond. Praise for Reset &#8220;Necessary and incisive . . . As Ellen Pao detailed her experiences, while also communicating her passion for the work men often impeded her from doing, I was nothing short of infuriated. It was great to see a highly accomplished woman of color speaking out like this, and hopefully this book will encourage more women to come forward, give voice to their experiences in the workplace, and contribute to meaningful change.&#8221;&#8211;Roxane Gay</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to read&#8230;This Will Be My Undoing.&#8221;-Roxane Gay     </p>
<p>                    One of the sharpest, fiercest, and most eloquent critics writing right now, Morgan Jerkins&#8217;s byline has appeared around the Internet for The New Yorker&#8217;s Page-Turner, Vogue, the New York Times, the Atlantic, Buzzfeed, and more; in this highly anticipated collection of linked essays perfect for fans of Bad Feminist, Rebecca Solnit&#8217;s Men Explain Things to Me, and Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie&#8217;s We Should All Be Feminists, Jerkins interweaves the incisive commentary on pop culture, feminism, black history, misogyny, and racism that she&#8217;s known for with her own experiences to confront the very real challenges of being a black woman today.    </p>
<p>                              &#8220;Growing up as a black woman is different. It prepares you to remember that you have to navigate two worlds. In this predominantly white, male-dominated world, you will never be white or male. Within the black community, belonging to the world of black women demands strength, wit, and aggression, because space for and by ourselves is small. You either assert yourself or learn to do so through humiliation, a constant shedding of respectability necessary to expose who you really are: just another black girl fighting to exist.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                              Morgan Jerkins is only in her twenties, but she has already established herself as an insightful, brutally honest writer who isn&#8217;t afraid of tackling tough, controversial subjects. In This Will Be My Undoing, she takes on perhaps one of the most provocative contemporary topics: What does it mean to &#8220;be&#8221;-to live as, to exist as-a black woman today? This is a book about black women, but it&#8217;s necessary reading for all Americans.     </p>
<p>                              Doubly disenfranchised by race and gender, often deprived of a place within the mostly white mainstream feminist movement, black women are objectified, silenced, and marginalized with devastating consequences, in ways both obvious and subtle, that are rarely acknowledged in our country&#8217;s larger discussion about inequality. In This Will Be My Undoing, Jerkins becomes both narrator and subject to expose the social, cultural, and historical story of black female oppression that influences the black community as well the white, male-dominated world at large.     </p>
<p>                              Whether she&#8217;s writing about Sailor Moon; Rachel Dolezal; the stigma of therapy; her complex relationship with her own physical body; the pain of dating when men say they don&#8217;t &#8220;see color&#8221;; being a black visitor in Russia; the specter of &#8220;the fast-tailed girl&#8221; and the paradox of black female sexuality; or disabled black women in the context of the &#8220;Black Girl Magic&#8221; movement, Jerkins is concise, compelling, and often revelatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Caitlin Moran&#8217;s How To Be A Womanis the fun-filled manual for female survival in the 21st century, everyday sexism is its more politicised sister&#8217; (Independent on Sunday).    </p>
<p>                    After experiencing a series of escalating sexist incidents, Laura Bates started theeveryday sexism projectand has gone on to write &#8216;a pioneering analysis of modern day misogyny&#8217; (Telegraph).    </p>
<p>                    After an astounding response from the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, the project quickly became one of the biggest social media success stories of the internet.     </p>
<p>                    From being harassed and wolf-whistled at on the street, to discrimination in the workplace and serious sexual assault, it is clear that sexism had become normalised. But Bates inspires women to lead a real change and writes this &#8216;extremely powerful book that could, and should, win hearts and minds right across the spectrum&#8217; (Financial Times).     </p>
<p>                    Often shocking, sometimes amusing and always poignant, everyday sexism is a protest against inequality and a manifesto for change. It&#8217;s &#8216;a game-changing book, a must-read for every woman&#8217; (Cosmopolitan).    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Admirable and culturally transferable. &#8220;A storm is coming,&#8221; writes Bates. After reading this book you&#8217;ll hope so&#8217; (Independent).Welcome to the fourth wave of feminism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING MEMOIR     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Incredibly moving and haunting&#8217; Roxane Gay<br />
                    &#8216;I read this book cover to cover and it stunned me&#8217; Jia Tolentino<br />
                    &#8216;Powerful, honest and necessary&#8217; Marian Keyes    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Chanel Miller&#8217;s story changed our world forever. In 2016 Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after he was caught sexually assaulting her on Stanford&#8217;s campus. His light sentencing, and Chanel&#8217;s victim impact statement, which was read by eleven million people in four days, sparked international outrage and action.    </p>
<p>                    Know My Name is an intimate, profoundly moving memoir that exposes a patriarchal culture biased to protect perpetrators, a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and ultimately shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Entwining pain, resilience, and humour, this breath-taking memoir will stand as a modern classic.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I could not put this phenomenal book down&#8217; Glennon Doyle, bestselling author of UNTAMED    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To read Know My Name inspires hope&#8217; Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A searing, beautiful book&#8217; Sunday Times      </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Know My Name marks the debut of a gifted young writer. Miller&#8217;s words are purpose. They are maps. And she is a treasure who has prevailed&#8217; New York Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need this message more than ever&#8217; Malala Yousafzai    </p>
<p>                    The right to:<br />
                    Spend your own money. Go to school. Earn an income. Access contraceptives. Work outside the home. Walk outside the home. Choose whom to marry. Get a loan. Start a business. Own property. Divorce a husband. See a doctor. Drive a car.<br />
                    All of these rights are denied to women in some parts of the world.    </p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times bestselling debut from Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women&#8217;s empowerment.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;How can we summon a moment of lift for human beings &#8211; and especially for women? Because when you lift up women, you lift up humanity.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    In this moving and compelling book, Melinda shares the stories of the inspiring people she&#8217;s met during her work and travels around the world and the lessons she&#8217;s learned from them. As she writes in the introduction, &#8220;That is why I had to write this book &#8211; to share the stories of people who have given focus and urgency to my life. I want all of us to see ways we can lift women up where we live.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    Melinda&#8217;s unforgettable narrative is backed by startling data as she presents the issues that most need our attention &#8211; from child marriage to lack of access to contraceptives to gender inequity in the workplace. And, for the first time, she writes about her personal life and the road to equality in her own marriage. Throughout, she shows how there has never been more opportunity to change the world &#8211; and ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    When we lift others up, they lift us up, too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the best-selling author of Americanah and We Should All Be Feminists comes a powerful new statement about feminism today &#8211; written as a letter to a friend.<br />
                              A few years ago, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie received a letter from a dear friend from childhood, asking her how to raise her baby girl as a feminist. Dear Ijeawele is Adichie&#8217;s letter of response.    </p>
<p>                              Here are fifteen invaluable suggestions-compelling, direct, wryly funny, and perceptive-for how to empower a daughter to become a strong, independent woman. From encouraging her to choose a helicopter, and not only a doll, as a toy if she so desires; having open conversations with her about clothes, makeup, and sexuality; debunking the myth that women are somehow biologically arranged to be in the kitchen making dinner, and that men can &#8220;allow&#8221; women to have full careers, Dear Ijeawele goes right to the heart of sexual politics in the twenty-first century. It will start a new and urgently needed conversation about what it really means to be a woman today.</p>

<p>                    ***BEST BOOKS OF 2018 SELECTION BY***<br />
                     * WASHINGTON POST  * People * NPR * ESQUIRE * ELLE * WIRED * REFINERY 29 *    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;In a year when issues of gender and sexuality dominated the national conversation, no one shaped that exchange more than Rebecca Traister. Her wise and provocative columns helped make sense of a cultural transformation.&#8221;-National Magazine Award Citation, 2018    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The most brilliant voice on feminism in this country.&#8221;-Anne Lamott, author of Bird by Bird    </p>
<p>                    From Rebecca Traister, the New York Times bestselling author of All the Single Ladies comes a vital, incisive exploration into the transformative power of female anger and its ability to transcend into a political movement.     </p>
<p>                    In the year 2018, it seems as if women&#8217;s anger has suddenly erupted into the public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women&#8217;s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women&#8217;s anger was not only politically catalytic-but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded women&#8217;s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.    </p>
<p>                     With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuel-from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores women&#8217;s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way women&#8217;s collective fury has become transformative political fuel-as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs society&#8217;s (and the media&#8217;s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions.    </p>
<p>                     Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traister&#8217;s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women&#8217;s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.</p>

<p>                    In the space of ten years, Sophia Amoruso has gone from high-school dropout to founder and Executive Chairman of Nasty Gal, one of the fastest-growing retailers in the world.     </p>
<p>                    Sophia&#8217;s never been a typical executive, or a typical anything, and she&#8217;s written #GIRLBOSS for other girls like her: outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success.    </p>
<p>                    Filled with brazen wake-up calls, cunning and frank observations, and behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty Gal&#8217;s meteoric rise, #GIRLBOSS covers a lot of ground. It proves that success doesn&#8217;t come from where you went to college or how popular you were in school. Success is about trusting your instincts and following your gut, knowing which rules to follow and which to break.    </p>
<p>                    Inspiring, motivating and empowering, #GIRLBOSS will give you the kick up the ass you need to reach your potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years after the sexual revolution, we are told that we live in a time of unprecedented sexual freedom; that if anything, we are too free now. But beneath the veneer of glossy hedonism, millennial journalist Rachel Hills argues that we are controlled by a new brand of sexual convention: one which influences all of us-woman or man, straight or gay, liberal or conservative. At the root of this silent code lies the Sex Myth-the defining significance we invest in sexuality that once meant we were dirty if we didhave sex, and now means we are defective if we don&#8217;tdo it enough.     </p>
<p>                    Equal parts social commentary, pop culture, and powerful personal anecdotes from people across the English-speaking world, The Sex Mythexposes the invisible norms and unspoken assumptions that shape the way we think about sex today.</p>

Deeply researched, and filled with all the warm, wise and funny anecdotes that first made her the most trusted and admired voice on the issue, Anne-Marie Slaughter&#8217;s book is sure to change minds, ignite debate and be the topic of conversation.</p>

<p>                    Ever find yourself snowed under at the office &#8211; or even just glued to the sofa &#8211; when you really want to get out (for once), get to the gym (at last), and get started on that daunting dream project you&#8217;re always putting off? Or if you are confined to barracks and that&#8217;s driving you nuts, then it&#8217;s time to get your sh*t together.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION * BEST BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION BY THE BOSTON GLOBE * ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY * NPR * CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY *    </p>
<p>                     The New York Times bestselling investigation into the sexual, economic, and emotional lives of women is &#8220;an informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just the single ladies-who want to gain a greater understanding of this pivotal moment in the history of the United States&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review).    </p>
<p>                    In 2009, award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman. It was the year the proportion of American women who were married dropped below fifty percent; and the median age of first marriages, which had remained between twenty and twenty-two years old for nearly a century (1890-1980), had risen dramatically to twenty-seven.    </p>
<p>                    But over the course of her vast research and more than a hundred interviews with academics and social scientists and prominent single women, Traister discovered a startling truth: the phenomenon of the single woman in America is not a new one. And historically, when women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, the results were massive social change-temperance, abolition, secondary education, and more. Today, only twenty percent of Americans are married by age twenty-nine, compared to nearly sixty percent in 1960.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just single ladies&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review), All the Single Ladies is a remarkable portrait of contemporary American life and how we got here, through the lens of the unmarried American woman. Covering class, race, sexual orientation, and filled with vivid anecdotes from fascinating contemporary and historical figures, &#8220;we&#8217;re better off reading Rebecca Traister on women, politics, and America than pretty much anyone else&#8221; (The Boston Globe).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestseller! To build a world that works for everyone, we must first make the radical decision to love every facet of ourselves. . . . &#8216;The body is not an apology&#8217; is the mantra we should all embrace.<br />
                    &#8211;Kimberlé Crenshaw, legal scholar and founder and Executive Director, African American Policy Forum    </p>
<p>                    Humans are a varied and divergent bunch with all manner of beliefs, morals, and bodies. Systems of oppression thrive off our inability to make peace with difference and injure the relationship we have with our own bodies.     </p>
<p>                    The Body Is Not an Apology offers radical self-love as the balm to heal the wounds inflicted by these violent systems. World-renowned activist and poet Sonya Renee Taylor invites us to reconnect with the radical origins of our minds and bodies and celebrate our collective, enduring strength. As we awaken to our own indoctrinated body shame, we feel inspired to awaken others and to interrupt the systems that perpetuate body shame and oppression against all bodies. When we act from this truth on a global scale, we usher in the transformative opportunity of radical self-love, which is the opportunity for a more just, equitable, and compassionate world&#8211;for us all.     </p>
<p>                    This second edition includes stories from Taylor&#8217;s travels around the world combating body terrorism and shines a light on the path toward liberation guided by love. In a brand new final chapter, she offers specific tools, actions, and resources for confronting racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia, and transphobia. And she provides a case study showing how radical self-love not only dismantles shame and self-loathing in us but has the power to dismantle entire systems of injustice. Together with the accompanying workbook, Your Body Is Not an Apology, Taylor brings the practice of radical self-love to life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An urgent account of sexual politics, feminism, and the rules of power in America-and a potent vision for the way forward    </p>
<p>                    As a veteran feminist and agenda-setting sex educator, Jaclyn Friedman is on the frontlines of the war for equity between the sexes. In Unscrewed, Friedman brings her sharp expertise and incisive observations on the state of sexual politics to the fore, sparking a culture-wide rethink about sex, power and what we accept.<br />
                     With reportage and verve, Unscrewed builds a searing investigation into the state of sexual power in America, and outlines how to make real progress toward equality. Friedman reveals that the anxiety and fear women in our country feel around issues of their sexuality are not, in fact, their fault, but instead are side effects of what she calls our &#8220;era of fauxpowerment,&#8221; wherein women have the illusion of sexual power, with no actual power to support it. Exploring the fault lines where media, religion, politics, and education impinge on our intimate lives, Unscrewed breaks down the causes and signs of fauxpowerment, then gives readers tools to take it on themselves.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;HELL YES. This is one of those books that has the potential to change things &#8211; a monumental piece of research&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    Imagine a world where&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    *        Your phone is too big for your hand<br />
                    *        Your doctor prescribes a drug that is wrong for your body<br />
                    *        In a car accident you are 47% more likely to be injured.    </p>
<p>                    If any of that sounds familiar, chances are you&#8217;re a woman.    </p>
<p>                    From government policy and medical research, to technology, workplaces, and the media. Invisible Women reveals how in a world built for and by men we are systematically ignoring half of the population, often with disastrous consequences. Caroline Criado Perez brings together for the first time an impressive range of case studies, stories and new research from across the world that illustrate the hidden ways in which women are forgotten, and the profound impact this has on us all.    </p>
<p>                    Discover the shocking gender bias that affects our everyday lives.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A book that changes the way you see the world&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Revelatory, frightening, hopeful&#8217; Jeanette Winterson</p>

<p>                    WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY NATALIE HAYNES    </p>
<p>                    When this book was first published in 1949 it was to outrage and scandal. Never before had the case for female liberty been so forcefully and successfully argued. De Beauvoir&#8217;s belief that &#8216;One is not born, but rather becomes, woman&#8217; switched on light bulbs in the heads of a generation of women and began a fight for greater equality and economic independence. These pages contain the key passages of the book that changed perceptions of women forever.    </p>
<p>                    TRANSLATED BY CONSTANCE BORDE AND SHEILA MALOVANY-CHEVALLIER<br />
                    ANNOTATED AND INTRODUCED BY MARTINE REID</p>
