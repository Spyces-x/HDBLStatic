<p>                    Greg Heffley has always been in a hurry to grow up. Being older means you can live alone, eat whatever you want for dinner and don&#8217;t have to share with your brothers. PERFECT.</p>
<p>                    At least, that&#8217;s what Greg thought, but it turns out there&#8217;s a lot more to growing up like dealing with boy/girl dances, increased responsibilities and awkward changes.</p>
<p>                    On top of all this, he&#8217;s fighting with this best friend Rowley, and is being dragged to his uncle&#8217;s FIFTH wedding. Surely there&#8217;s more to growing up than THIS?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic legend Alan Moore&#8217;s highly-influential classic of British comics, presented to a new generation coloured and remastered for the very first time. &#8220;Where did she go? Out. What did she do? Everything&#8230;&#8221; Bored and frustrated with her life in 50th-century leisure-ghetto housing estate `The Hoop&#8217;, 18-year-old everywoman Halo Jones yearns for the infinite sights and sounds of the universe. Pledging to escape on a fantastic voyage, she sets in motion events unimaginable; a spell on a luxury space-liner, a brush with an interstellar war &#8211; Halo Jones faces hardship and adventure in the name of freedom in the limitless cosmos. A galaxy-spanning story, comics&#8217; first bona fide feminist space opera, and the first true epic to grace the bibliography of arguably the greatest comic book writer the world has ever known.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The classic masterpiece by #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King&#8211;illustrated by the legendary artist Bernie Wrightson!     </p>
<p>                    Terror began in January&#8211;by the light of the full moon&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    The first scream came from the snowbound railwayman who felt the werewolf&#8217;s fangs ripping at his throat. The next month there was a scream of ecstatic agony from the woman attacked in her cozy bedroom. Now scenes of unbelievable horror unfold each time the full moon shines on the isolated Maine town of Tarker&#8217;s Mills. No one knows who will be attacked next. But one thing is sure. When the full moon rises, a paralyzing fear sweeps through Tarker&#8217;s Mills. For snarls that sound like human words can be heard whining through the wind. And all around are the footprints of a monster whose hunger cannot be sated&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of the books in Nathan Hale&#8217;s Hazardous Tales has elements of the strange but true and is presented in an engaging, funny format, highlighting the larger-than-life characters that pop up in real history. Big Bad Ironclad! covers the history of the amazing ironclad steam warships used in the Civil War.From the ship&#8217;s inventor, who had a history of blowing things up and only 100 days to complete his project, to the mischievous William Cushing, who pranked his way through the whole war, this book is filled with surprisingly true facts and funny, brave characters that modern readers will easily relate to.Praise for Nathan Hale&#8217;s Hazardous Tales: Big Bad Ironclad&#8221;Livelier than the typical history textbook but sillier than the many outstanding works on the Civil War available for young readers, this will appeal to both history buffs and graphic-novel enthusiasts.&#8221;-Kirkus Reviews&#8221;Readers interested in American history will enjoy these graphic novels&#8230; Comic panels of varying sizes enhance the real-life events and support the stories&#8217; over-the-top humor&#8230; the writing is accessible and entertaining; author Hale&#8217;s style gives readers an insider-y, you-are-there-type scoop.&#8221;-Horn BookAward:New York Public Library&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Books 2012: 100 Books for Reading and Sharing list    </p>

<p>                    F. C. Yee&#8217;s The Rise of Kyoshi delves into the story of Kyoshi, the Earth Kingdom-born Avatar. The longest-living Avatar in this beloved world&#8217;s history, Kyoshi established the brave and respected Kyoshi Warriors, but also founded the secretive Dai Li, which led to the corruption, decline, and fall of her own nation. The first of two novels based on Kyoshi, The Rise of Kyoshi maps her journey from a girl of humble origins to the merciless pursuer of justice who is still feared and admired centuries after she became the Avatar.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 Kindle Bestseller on Amazon.com     </p>
<p>                    Winner of Kindle Book Review&#8217;s Best Indie Book of 2012 Award     </p>
<p>                    Wool as you&#8217;ve never read it before: The New York Times bestselling novel now told in graphic novel format featuring full-color illustrations by Hugo Award-nominated artist Jimmy Broxton, and as adapted by fan-favorite writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. This contemporary dystopian classic&#8211;hailed by Justin Cronin, New York Times bestselling author of The Passage, as &#8220;an epic feat of imagination&#8221;&#8211;will captivate readers both familiar and new.     </p>
<p>                    This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.    </p>
