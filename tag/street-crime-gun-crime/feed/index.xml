										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sudhir Venkatesh the young sociologist who became famous in Freakonomics (Why do drug dealers still live with their moms?) describes his time living with the gangs on the Southside of Chicago and answers another question: what&#8217;s it like to live in hell?    </p>
<p>                    In the Robert Taylor Homes projects on Chicago&#8217;s South Side, Sudhir befriends J.T., a gang leader for the Black Kings. As he slowly gains J.T.&#8217;s trust, one day, in order to convince Sudhir of his own CEO-like qualities, J.T. makes him leader of the gang&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Why does J.T. make his henchmen, the &#8216;shorties&#8217;, stay in school? What is the difference between a &#8216;regular&#8217; hustler and a &#8216;hype&#8217; &#8211; and is Peanut telling him the truth about which she is? And, when the FBI finally starts cracking down on the Black Kings, is it time to get out &#8211; or is it too late?</p>
