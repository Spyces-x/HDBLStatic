<p>                              &#8216;If you want to gain insight into the mind of great athletes, adventurers, and peak performers then prepare to be enthralled by Alex Hutchinson&#8217;s Endure.&#8217; &#8211; BEAR GRYLLS    </p>
<p>                              How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person&#8217;s limits? From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we&#8217;re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.    </p>
<p>                              In Endure Alex Hutchinson, Ph.D., reveals why our individual limits may be determined as much by our head and heart, as by our muscles. He presents an overview of science&#8217;s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs&#8217; legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits, he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals-whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid-and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.    </p>
<p>                              An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology &#8211; brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging &#8211; and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today, showing us how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance &#8211; and get the most out of their bodies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrossFit trainer Ben Bergeron has helped build the world&#8217;s fittest athletes, but he&#8217;s not like other coaches. He believes that greatness is not for the elite few; that winning is a result, not a goal; and that character, not talent, is what makes a true champion.

The mindset and methodology that have produced some of the greatest athletes in the world&#8217;s most gruelling sport can work equally well for golfers, lawyers, artists, entrepreneurs-anyone who&#8217;s willing to commit totally to becoming better than the best.By Chasing Excellence, you&#8217;ll discover how extraordinary it&#8217;s possible for you to be.</p>

<p>                                &#8216;Bella&#8217;s brilliant love letter to running turns into an extraordinarily brave and frank account of her battle with anxiety. A compassionate and important book&#8217; Joe Lycett    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;Perfect for resetting a glum January mindset&#8217; Alexandra Heminsley    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;My kind of role model&#8217; Ben Fogle    </p>
<p>                              Divorced and struggling with deep-rooted mental health problems, Bella Mackie ended her twenties in tears. She could barely find the strength to get off the sofa, let alone piece her life back together. Until one day she did something she had never done of her own free will &#8211; she pulled on a pair of trainers and went for a run.    </p>
<p>                              That first attempt didn&#8217;t last very long. But to her surprise, she was back out there the next day. And the day after that. She began to set herself achievable goals &#8211; to run 5k in under 30 minutes, to walk to work every day for a week, to attempt 10 push-ups in a row. Before she knew it, her mood was lifting for the first time in years.    </p>
<p>                              In Jog On, Bella explains with hilarious and unfiltered honesty how she used running to battle crippling anxiety and depression, without having to sacrifice her main loves: booze, cigarettes and ice cream. With the help of a supporting cast of doctors, psychologists, sportspeople and friends, she shares a wealth of inspirational stories, research and tips that show how exercise often can be the best medicine. This funny, moving and motivational book will encourage you to say &#8216;jog on&#8217; to your problems and get your life back on track &#8211; no matter how small those first steps may be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the heart of Born to Run lies a mysterious tribe of Mexican Indians, the Tarahumara, who live quietly in canyons and are reputed to be the best distance runners in the world; in 1993, one of them, aged 57, came first in a prestigious 100-mile race wearing a toga and sandals. A small group of the world&#8217;s top ultra-runners (and the awe-inspiring author) make the treacherous journey into the canyons to try to learn the tribe&#8217;s secrets and then take them on over a course 50 miles long.    </p>
<p>                    With incredible energy and smart observation, McDougall tells this story while asking what the secrets are to being an incredible runner. Travelling to labs at Harvard, Nike, and elsewhere, he comes across an incredible cast of characters, including the woman who recently broke the world record for 100 miles and for her encore ran a 2:50 marathon in a bikini, pausing to down a beer at the 20 mile mark.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;I read Mind Gym on my way to the Sydney Olympics and really got a lot out of it. Gary has important lessons to teach, and you&#8217;ll find the exercises fun and beneficial.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe De Sena, one of the founding creators of Spartan Races, sounds the alarm of how soft and weak we&#8217;ve become through modern living. Spartan Up! is a call to arms, motivating readers to take action in their lives through inspiring stories and practical advice.    </p>
<p>                    What do marathoners do when 26.2 miles just isn&#8217;t enough anymore? They try obstacle racing, combining the endurance challenges of a marathon with the mind- and body-bending rigors of overcoming obstacles along the way. At the heart of this phenomenon is Joe De Sena, the driving force behind the Spartan Race.     </p>
<p>                    De Sena overcame his own obstacles&#8211;working his way from Queens to Wall Street to legendary extreme athlete&#8211;by adhering to a simple philosophy: commit to a goal, put in the work, and get it done. From that philosophy, as played out now for millions across trails, through mud, and up mountainsides, the Spartan Race was born.     </p>
<p>                    Filled with unforgettable stories of Spartan racers as well as hard-won truths learned along the course, Spartan Up! will help you reach your full potential in whatever you set out to do.    </p>
<p>                    A must-read for anyone looking to take his performance to the next level, be it in athletics or in life.&#8211;Dean Karnazes, author of Ultra Marathon Man     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;If there&#8217;s anyone out there who has taken extreme to a new level, its Joe De Sena&#8211;in adventure racing, in business, and ultimately in the business of adventure! Spartan Up! is a must-read.&#8221;&#8211;Robyn Benincasa, world champion adventure racer and New York Times best-selling author of How Winning Works</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Lyrical and passionate &#8230; a celebration of the human spirit and what it can achieve&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    Two hours to cover twenty-six miles and 385 yards. An exceptional feat of speed, mental strength and endurance. The sub-two-hour marathon is running&#8217;s Everest, a feat once seen as impossible for the human body. But now we have reached the mountaintop.    </p>
<p>                    In this spellbinding book Ed Caesar takes us into the world of the elite of the elite: the greatest marathoners on earth. Through the stories of these rich characters, and their troubled lives, he traces the history of the marathon as well as the science, physiology and psychology involved in running so fast, for so long. And he shows us why this most democratic of races retains its savage, enthralling appeal &#8211; why we are drawn to test ourselves to the limit.    </p>
<p>                    Now with a new afterword telling the inside story of how Eliud Kipchoge achieved the impossible, with exclusive access to Nike&#8217;s #Breaking2 project, and the Ineos159 event at which the barrier was finally broken.</p>
