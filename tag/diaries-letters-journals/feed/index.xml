										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrated actor, personality, and all-around nerd Wil Wheaton updates his memoir of collected blog posts with all new material and annotations as he reexamines one of the most interesting lives in Hollywood and fandom!<br />
                              Wil Wheaton grew up.    </p>
<p>                              Ideally, this is what everyone does. But most of us don&#8217;t do it in front of millions of people. Wil was a very famous kid &#8211; right up until he wasn&#8217;t. After that, he wasn&#8217;t sure who he was at all.    </p>
<p>                              So, in 2001, he started a blog. It was less about being a famous child than about being a not-so-famous grownup. He wrote about his pets and his hobbies, punk rock and parenting, board games and birthdays and (most importantly) burritos.    </p>
<p>                              He thought he was writing for an audience of one: himself. To be fair, he was only off by about 3 million people. In Still Just a Geek, an older, somewhat wiser Wil revisits Just a Geek, his 2004 collection of posts from that blog, with all-new reflections on nerd culture, fame, love, trauma, tragedy, and confronting the worst parts of yourself.    </p>
<p>                                Equal parts funny and poignant, Still Just a Geek explores the folly of youth and the pain of experience &#8211; and all the strange, awful, beautiful adventures in between.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT is an empowering letter from former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri to the first woman president, and by extension, to all women working to succeed in any field.     </p>
<p>                    By using lessons learned during her experiences with Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and Elizabeth Edwards &#8211; to name a few &#8211; Palmieri through each chapter creates a forward-thinking framework of inspirational and practical advice for all women everywhere &#8211; from boardrooms to living rooms &#8211; who are determined to seize control of their lives, their workplaces, and their country. DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT will turn the results of the 2016 election into something incredibly empowering for future female leaders and independent thinkers everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    We haven&#8217;t wrapped our heads around what it should look like for a woman to be in the job of President. Our only models are men. This of course was seen during the Hillary Clinton campaign, and no one knows this better than Jennifer Palmieri. While wildly disappointed by the outcome of the election, Palmieri optimistically argues in the book that the Clinton candidacy and all she experienced on the campaign trail &#8211; confusion, admiration, hate, love, acceptance, rejection &#8211; can now open the country up to reimagining women in leadership roles. And that is what Palmieri takes on in this book &#8211; redefining expectations for women looking to lead and creating a blueprint for women candidates and leaders to follow.</p>

<p>                    Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat . . . but 1.4 million NHS staff are heading off to work. In this perfect present for anyone who has ever set foot in a hospital, Adam Kay delves back into his diaries for a hilarious, horrifying and sometimes heartbreaking peek behind the blue curtain at Christmastime.    </p>
<p>                    This is a love letter to all those who spend their festive season on the front line, removing babies and baubles from the various places they get stuck, at the most wonderful time of the year.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The perfect surgical stocking-filler&#8217; &#8211; The Times    </p>
<p>                    Two different covers of Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas have been printed: one has a special festive design, and the other is our original hardback design. You will either receive the festive design or the original (as shown here) in your order. Specific covers cannot be requested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jauhar weaves his own personal and family story into his history of the heart&#8230;very effectively&#8230; This gives a certain dramatic tension to the book, as it tells the fascinating and rather wonderful history of cardiology.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    -Henry Marsh, New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    A Mail on Sunday Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    The heart lies at the centre of life. For cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar it is an obsession.    </p>
<p>                    In this fascinating history he interweaves gripping scenes from the operating theatre with the moving tale of his family&#8217;s history of heart problems &#8211; from the death of his grandfather to the ominous signs of how he himself might die.    </p>
<p>                    Jauhar looks at the pioneers who risked patients&#8217; lives and their own careers, and confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that how we live is more important than any device or drug we may invent. Heart is the all-encompassing story of the engine of life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INCLUDES NEW MATERIAL    </p>
<p>                    WRITTEN IN HISTORY celebrates the great letters of world history, creative culture and personal life. Acclaimed historian Simon Sebag Montefiore selects over one hundred letters from ancient times to the twenty-first century: some are noble and inspiring, some despicable and unsettling; some are exquisite works of literature, others brutal, coarse and frankly outrageous; many are erotic, others heartbreaking. The writers vary from Elizabeth I, Rameses the Great and Leonard Cohen to Emmeline Pankhurst, Mandela, Stalin, Michelangelo, Suleiman the Magnificent and unknown people in extraordinary circumstances &#8211; from love letters to calls for liberation, declarations of war to reflections on death. In the colourful, accessible style of a master storyteller, Montefiore shows why these letters are essential reading: how they enlighten our past, enrich the way we live now &#8211; and illuminate tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is philosophy that has the duty of protecting us &#8230; without it no one can lead a life free of fear or worry&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    For several years of his turbulent life, in which he was dogged by ill health, exile and danger, Seneca was the guiding hand of the Roman Empire. This selection of Seneca&#8217;s letters shows him upholding the ideals of Stoicism &#8211; the wisdom of the self-possessed person immune to life&#8217;s setbacks &#8211; while valuing friendship and courage, and criticizing the harsh treatment of slaves and the cruelties in the gladiatorial arena. The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca&#8217;s interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.    </p>
<p>                    Selected and translated with an Introduction by Robin Campbell</p>
