										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A trip to the doctor is almost a guarantee of misery. You&#8217;ll make an appointment months in advance. You&#8217;ll probably wait for several hours until you hear &#8220;the doctor will see you now&#8221;,but only for fifteen minutes! Then you&#8217;ll wait even longer for lab tests, the results of which you&#8217;ll likely never see, unless they indicate further (and more invasive) tests, most of which will probably prove unnecessary (much like physicals themselves). And your bill will be astronomical.In  The Patient Will See You Now , Eric Topol, one of the nation&#8217;s top physicians, shows why medicine does not have to be that way. Instead, you could use your smartphone to get rapid test results from one drop of blood, monitor your vital signs both day and night, and use an artificially intelligent algorithm to receive a diagnosis without having to see a doctor, all at a small fraction of the cost imposed by our modern healthcare system. The change is powered by what Topol calls medicine&#8217;s &#8220;Gutenberg moment.&#8221; Much as the printing press took learning out of the hands of a priestly class, the mobile internet is doing the same for medicine, giving us unprecedented control over our healthcare. With smartphones in hand, we are no longer beholden to an impersonal and paternalistic system in which &#8220;doctor knows best.&#8221; Medicine has been digitized, Topol argues now it will be democratized. Computers will replace physicians for many diagnostic tasks, citizen science will give rise to citizen medicine, and enormous data sets will give us new means to attack conditions that have long been incurable. Massive, open, online medicine, where diagnostics are done by Facebook-like comparisons of medical profiles, will enable real-time, real-world research on massive populations. There&#8217;s no doubt the path forward will be complicated: the medical establishment will resist these changes, and digitized medicine inevitably raises serious issues surrounding privacy. Nevertheless, the result,better, cheaper, and more human health care,will be worth it.Provocative and engrossing,  The Patient Will See You Now  is essential reading for anyone who thinks they deserve better health care. That is, for all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The number one Sunday Times bestseller &#8211; with a new, fantastically festive front cover! Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas is a short gift book of festive diaries from the author of multi-million-copy bestseller This is Going to Hurt.    </p>
<p>                    Christmas is coming, the goose is getting fat . . . but 1.4 million NHS staff are heading off to work. In this perfect present for anyone who has ever set foot in a hospital, Adam Kay delves back into his diaries for a hilarious, horrifying and sometimes heartbreaking peek behind the blue curtain at Christmastime.    </p>
<p>                    This is a love letter to all those who spend their festive season on the front line, removing babies and baubles from the various places they get stuck, at the most wonderful time of the year.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The perfect surgical stocking-filler&#8217; &#8211; The Times    </p>
<p>                    Two different covers of Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas have been printed: one has a special festive design, and the other is our original hardback design. You will either receive the festive design or the original (as shown here) in your order. Specific covers cannot be requested.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jauhar weaves his own personal and family story into his history of the heart&#8230;very effectively&#8230; This gives a certain dramatic tension to the book, as it tells the fascinating and rather wonderful history of cardiology.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    -Henry Marsh, New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    A Mail on Sunday Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    The heart lies at the centre of life. For cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar it is an obsession.    </p>
<p>                    In this fascinating history he interweaves gripping scenes from the operating theatre with the moving tale of his family&#8217;s history of heart problems &#8211; from the death of his grandfather to the ominous signs of how he himself might die.    </p>
<p>                    Jauhar looks at the pioneers who risked patients&#8217; lives and their own careers, and confronts the limits of medical technology, arguing that how we live is more important than any device or drug we may invent. Heart is the all-encompassing story of the engine of life.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Painfully funny. The pain and the funniness somehow add up to something entirely good, entirely noble and entirely loveable.&#8217; &#8211; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    Welcome to the life of a junior doctor: 97-hour weeks, life and death decisions, a constant tsunami of bodily fluids, and the hospital parking meter earns more than you.    </p>
