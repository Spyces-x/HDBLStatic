										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling memoir about identity, love and understanding. Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, directed by Joel Edgerton. &#8220;Every sentence of the story will stir your soul&#8221; (O Magazine).    </p>
<p>                    The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to cure him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness.     </p>
<p>                    By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, Boy Erased is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wish I had been brave enough to come out earlier in my tenure as CEO of BP. I regret it to this day. I know that if I had done so I would have made more of an impact for other gay men and women. With The Glass Closet, I hope to give some of them the courage to make an impact of their own.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     Whether you&#8217;re lesbian, gay, transgender or straight, John Browne&#8217;s message is simple and clear, it&#8217;s better for you and it&#8217;s better for business when you bring your authentic self to work.    </p>
<p>                     Drawing on his personal experiences and the experience of other gay and lesbian business leaders, and by investigating the research and the social contexts, The Glass Closet strives to give courage and inspire the LGBT community that despite the risks involved, self-disclosure is best for employees and for the businesses that support them.    </p>
<p>                     Every CEO, every HR Manager, every team leader &#8211; anyone who is responsible for the culture and success of their business should read The Glass Closet. And for anyone fearful or lacking the confidence to bring their true self into work every day, this book was written for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next Generation Indie Book Awards Winner in LGBT . &#8220;An important resource for readers of any age who are struggling to understand their sexual orientation, or those who would like to better understand asexuality.&#8221; -Library Journal, starred review<br />
                    Julie Sondra Decker&#8217;s book functions as a starting point for people interested in asexuality. It covers the basics of what asexuality is and isn&#8217;t, explores the most common issues asexual people may be dealing with, presents some pointers for newly asexual-identified people and the people who love them, and includes some resources to find out more. It&#8217;s for the layperson, written in everyday language.    </p>
<p>                    She writes for people who are on the asexual spectrum, people who think they might be asexual, friends and family and partners of people who have come out as asexual, curious parties, and those looking for information on the subject for their school papers, sexuality studies, and alternative sexuality resources. And it&#8217;s for people who think asexuality doesn&#8217;t exist. Chapters include:    </p>
<p>                    Asexuality as a Sexual Orientation<br />
                    Romantic Orientation<br />
                    Libido and Masturbation<br />
                    Intimate and Sexual Activity<br />
                    Asexual Relationships<br />
                    Asexual Community<br />
                    Should Asexual People Get Therapy and Be Fixed<br />
                    Am I Asexual?<br />
                    Should I Come Out?<br />
                    And much more    </p>
<p>                    If you think you may be asexual, or if you have a friend or partner who may be a sexual, this personal book will help you better understand what it means to be asexual in a world dominated by sexuality.</p>
