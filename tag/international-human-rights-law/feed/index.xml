										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Washington Post bestseller    </p>
<p>                    While the world has made encouraging strides in the fight against global poverty, there is a hidden crisis silently undermining our best efforts to help the poor.     </p>
<p>                    It is a plague of everyday violence.    </p>
<p>                    Beneath the surface of the world&#8217;s poorest communities, common violence &#8211; like rape, forced labor, illegal detention, land theft, police abuse and other brutality &#8211; has become routine and relentless.  And like a horde of locusts devouring everything in their path, the unchecked plague of violence ruins lives, blocks the road out of poverty, and undercuts development.     </p>
<p>                    How has this plague of violence grown so ferocious? The answer is terrifying, and startlingly simple: There&#8217;s nothing shielding the poor from violent people.  In one of the most remarkable &#8211; and unremarked upon &#8211; social disasters of the last half century, basic public justice systems in the developing world have descended into a state of utter collapse.     </p>
<p>                    Gary A. Haugen and Victor Boutros offer a searing account of how we got here &#8211; and what it will take to end the plague. Filled with vivid real-life stories and startling new data, The Locust Effect is a gripping journey into the streets and slums where fear is a daily reality for billions of the world&#8217;s poorest ,where safety is secured only for those with money, and where much of our well-intended aid is lost in the daily chaos of violence.    </p>
<p>                    While their call to action is urgent, Haugen and Boutros provide hope, a real solution and an ambitious way forward. The Locust Effect is a wake-up call: Its massive implications will forever change the way we understand global poverty &#8211; and will help secure a safe path to prosperity for the global poor in the 21st century.</p>
