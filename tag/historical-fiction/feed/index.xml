<p>                    Edinburgh, 1850. This city will bleed you dry.    </p>
<p>                    Dr Will Raven is a man seldom shocked by human remains, but even he is disturbed by the contents of a package washed up at the Port of Leith. Stranger still, a man Raven has long detested is pleading for his help to escape the hangman.    </p>
<p>                    Back in the townhouse of Dr James Simpson, Sarah Fisher has set her sights on learning to practise medicine. Almost everyone seems intent on dissuading her from this ambition, but when word reaches her that a woman has recently obtained a medical degree despite her gender, Sarah decides to seek her out.    </p>
<p>                    Raven&#8217;s efforts to prove his former adversary&#8217;s innocence are failing and he desperately needs Sarah&#8217;s help. Putting their feelings for one another aside, their investigations take them to both extremes of Edinburgh&#8217;s social divide, where they discover that wealth and status cannot alter a fate written in the blood.    </p>

                    &#8216;An education in love, and an iridescent delight&#8217; Rowan Pelling, Spectator</p>
<p>                    New York, 1940. Young, glamorous and inseparable, Vivian and Celia are chasing trouble from one end of the city to the other.

<p>                    City of Girls is about daring to break conventions and follow your desires: a celebration of glamour, resilience, growing up, and the joys of female friendship &#8211; and about the freedom that comes from finding a place you truly belong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the age of twelve, under the Wind Moon, Will is given a horse, a key, and a map, and sent alone into the Indian Nation to run a trading post as a bound boy. It is during this time that he grows into a man, learning, as he does, of the raw power it takes to create a life, to find a home. In a card game with a white Indian named Featherstone, Will wins &#8211; for a brief moment &#8211; a mysterious girl named Claire, and his passion and desire for her spans this novel. As Will&#8217;s destiny intertwines with the fate of the Cherokee Indians, including a Cherokee Chief named Bear, he learns how to fight and survive in the face of both nature and men, and eventually, under the Corn Tassle Moon, Will begins the fight against Washington City to preserve the Cherokee&#8217;s homeland and culture. And he will come to know the truth behind his belief that &#8216;only desire trumps time&#8217;.     </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly imagined, written with great power and beauty by a master of American fiction, Thirteen Moons is a stunning novel about a man&#8217;s passion for a woman, and how loss, longing and love can shape a man&#8217;s destiny over the many moons of a life.    </p>

<p>                                &#8216;Truly magical&#8217; Guardian</p>
<p>                              Those eyes are fixed on someone. But who? What is she thinking as she stares out from one of the world&#8217;s best-loved paintings?</p>
<p>                              Johannes Vermeer can spot exceptional beauty. When servant girl Griet catches his eye, she soon becomes both student and muse. But then he gives her his wife&#8217;s pearl earrings to wear for a portrait, and a scandal erupts that could threaten Griet&#8217;s future&#8230;</p>
<p>                                Vivid and captivating, this timeless modern classic has become a successful film and an international bestseller, with over 5 million copies sold around the world; now with a new introduction by the author.</p>

<p>                              &#8216;Timeless, delicate and as exquisitely measured as one of Vermeer&#8217;s paintings. Tense yet perfectly-paced and filled with the beauty of life&#8217;s colours, Girl with the Pearl Earring is a masterpiece in its own right. Just a phenomenon. I will hold this novel close for the rest of my life&#8217; Jessie Burton, author of The Minaturist</p>
<p>                              &#8216;If ever a novel rightly deserves its &#8220;five millions copies sold&#8221; achievement, it is this dazzling little masterpiece &#8230; Absolute magic&#8217; Daily Mail</p>
<p>                              &#8216;A portrait of radiance&#8230;Tracy Chevalier brings the real artist Vermeer and a fictional muse to life in a jewel of a novel&#8217; Time</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Chevalier doesn&#8217;t put a foot wrong in this triumphant work &#8230; It is a beautifully written tale that mirrors the elegance of the painting that inspired it&#8217; Wall Street Journal</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Geneva, American lawyer Joel Converse meets a man he hasn&#8217;t seen in twenty years, a covert operative who dies violently at his feet, whispering words that hand Converse a staggering legacy of death: &#8220;The generals . . . they&#8217;re back . . . Aquitaine!&#8221; Suddenly Converse is running for his life, alone with the world&#8217;s most shattering secret. Pursued by anonymous executioners to the dark corners of Europe, he is forced to play a game of survival by blood rules he thought he&#8217;d long left behind. One by one, he traces each thread of a lethal progression to the heart of every major government, a network of coordinated global violence that no one believes possible&#8211;no one but Converse and the woman he once loved and lost, the only two people on earth who can wrest the world from the iron grasp of Aquitaine.     </p>
<p>                     Praise for Robert Ludlum and The Aquitaine Progression    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND OPRAH&#8217;S BOOK CLUB PICK<br />
                      CHOSEN BY BARACK OBAMA AS A FAVOURITE READ<br />
                      TOP TEN BOOKS OF THE YEAR, NEW YORK TIMES &#038; WASHINGTON POST</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brilliantly imagined, larger than life, a tragicomedic epic of intertwined lives.&#8217; JOYCE CAROL OATES</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Deeply felt, beautifully written and profoundly humane.&#8217; JUNOT DIAZ, New York Times Book Review</p>
<p>                    The year is 1969. In a housing project in south Brooklyn, a shambling old church deacon called Sportcoat shoots &#8211; for no apparent reason &#8211; the local drug-dealer who used to be part of the church&#8217;s baseball team. The repercussions of that moment draw in the whole community, from Sportcoat&#8217;s best friend &#8211; Hot Sausage &#8211; to the local Italian mobsters, the police (corrupt and otherwise), and the stalwart ladies of the Five Ends Baptist Church.</p>
<p>                    DEACON KING KONG is a book about a community under threat, about the ways people pull together in an age when the old rules are being rewritten. It is very funny in places, and heartbreaking in others. From a prize-winning storyteller, this New York Times bestseller shows us that not all secrets are meant to be hidden, and that the communities we build are fragile but vital.<br />
                    ______________________<br />
                    From the winner of a National Book Award and author of the bestselling memoir,The Color of Water, and The Good Lord Bird, a TV series starring Ethan Hawke</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A hilarious, pitch-perfect comedy set in the Brooklyn projects of the late 1960s. This alone may qualify it as one of the year&#8217;s best novels.&#8217; The Washington Post</p>
<p>                    What Goodreads readers are saying:</p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;Deacon King Kong is one of those novels whose brilliance sneaks up on you. I haven&#8217;t been this pleasantly surprised by a book in a while.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;I do believe I just finished one of my all time favorite books. I loved every minute spent with Sportcoat and his community. A good old fashioned yarn shot through with truth, spirit, and humor. I LOVED it!&#8217;</p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;This book was a balm for my soul, a portrait of a black church community circa 1969 with sweet characters (well, most of them), interconnections that stretch back decades, and a plot with more than one mystery at its heart.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;&#8221;Deacon&#8221; has the texture of folk lore and fable mixed with the unexpected rhythms of jazz and the noisy streets of late 1960s Brooklyn.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;The ending was one of those where you clutch your heart and want to hug the book (or your Kindle).&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE FOR FICTION 2020</p>
<p>                    WINNER OF THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL FICTION 2020</p>
<p>                    Winner of the Library of Congress Prize for American Fiction 2020</p>
<p>                    Time #1 Novel of the Year 2019</p>
<p>                    ________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>                    Author of The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys sentenced to a hellish reform school in 1960s Florida.</p>
<p>                    Elwood Curtis has taken the words of Dr Martin Luther King to heart: he is as good as anyone. Abandoned by his parents, brought up by his loving, strict and clear-sighted grandmother, Elwood is about to enroll in the local black college. But given the time and the place, one innocent mistake is enough to destroy his future, and so Elwood arrives at The Nickel Academy, which claims to provide &#8216;physical, intellectual and moral training&#8217; which will equip its inmates to become &#8216;honorable and honest men&#8217;.</p>
<p>                    In reality, the Nickel Academy is a chamber of horrors, where physical, emotional and sexual abuse is rife, where corrupt officials and tradesmen do a brisk trade in supplies intended for the school, and where any boy who resists is likely to disappear &#8216;out back&#8217;. Stunned to find himself in this vicious environment, Elwood tries to hold on to Dr King&#8217;s ringing assertion, &#8216;Throw us in jail, and we will still love you.&#8217; But Elwood&#8217;s fellow inmate and new friend Turner thinks Elwood is naive and worse; the world is crooked, and the only way to survive is to emulate the cruelty and cynicism of their oppressors.</p>
<p>                    The tension between Elwood&#8217;s idealism and Turner&#8217;s skepticism leads to a decision which will have decades-long repercussions.</p>
<p>                    Based on the history of a real reform school in Florida that operated for one hundred and eleven years and warped and destroyed the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative by a great American novelist whose work is essential to understanding the current reality of the United States.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;If greatness is excellence sustained over time, then without question, Whitehead is one of the greatest of his generation. In fact, figuring his age, acclaim, productivity and consistency, he is one of the greatest American writers alive&#8217; Time</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A commanding triumph&#8217; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Every chapter hits its mark&#8217; New York Times</p>

<p>                    The Secret Life of Bees: The multi-million-copy bestselling novel about a young girl&#8217;s journey towards healing and the transforming power of love, from the award-winning author of The Invention of Wings. </p>
<p>                    Lily has grown up believing she accidentally killed her mother when she was four years old. Now, at fourteen, she yearns for forgiveness and a mother&#8217;s love. Living on a peach farm in South Carolina with her harsh and unforgiving father, she has only one friend, Rosaleen, a black servant.</p>
<p>                    When racial tension explodes one summer afternoon, and Rosaleen is arrested and beaten, Lily chooses to flee with her. Fugitives from justice, the pair follow a trail left by the woman who died ten years before. Finding sanctuary in the home of three beekeeping sisters, Lily starts a journey as much about her understanding of the world as about the mystery surrounding her mother. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The international Number One bestseller from the author of The Song of Achilles, shortlisted for the Women&#8217;s Prize for Fiction</p>
<p>                    Woman. Witch. Myth. Mortal. Outcast. Lover. Destroyer. Survivor. CIRCE.</p>
<p>                     In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. Circe is a strange child &#8211; not powerful and terrible, like her father, nor gorgeous and mercenary like her mother. Scorned and rejected, Circe grows up in the shadows, at home in neither the world of gods or mortals. But Circe has a dark power of her own: witchcraft. When her gift threatens the gods, she is banished to the island of Aiaia where she hones her occult craft, casting spells, gathering strange herbs and taming wild beasts. Yet a woman who stands alone will never be left in peace for long &#8211; and among her island&#8217;s guests is an unexpected visitor: the mortal Odysseus, for whom Circe will risk everything. </p>
<p>                     So Circe sets forth her tale, a vivid, mesmerizing epic of family rivalry, love and loss &#8211; the defiant, inextinguishable song of woman burning hot and bright through the darkness of a man&#8217;s world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miss Honeyford was sour on romance, but she had been duly dispatched to London to save the family fortune by hunting forand securinga wealthy husband and thereby proving her role as a loving, if not entirely dutiful, daughter. Honoraria obeyed. But if she was reluctantly willing to surrender her hand, this beautiful young lady who could ride, shoot, and argue with any man was not about to lose her head or her heart to any of the dismal cads and lads of the marriage mart.     </p>
<p>                    First she met the arrogantly attractive Lord Alistair Stewart, who treated her infuriatingly like a little girl. And then she met the skillfully seductive Lord Channington, who treated her intoxicatingly like the desirable full-grown woman that she was. But now that she had a choice, which role would she choose and just how much risk was she willing to run?    </p>
<p>                    The Regency series brings us heroines of style, grace, and determinationwomen who are not afraid to use their smarts to seek the stature or standing they feel they need. They may come from humble beginnings or not, but what these heroines share is an unmatched determination that leaves us turning page after page as we follow them in their dance.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young girl called Tozi stands at the bottom of a pyramid, waiting to be led to the top where her heart will be cut out&#8230;</p>
<p>                    Pepillo, a Spanish orphan who serves a sadistic Dominican friar, is aboard the Spanish fleet as it sails towards Mexico&#8230;</p>
<p>                    This is the epic story of the clash of two empires, two armies and two gods of war. Five hundred desperate adventurers are about to pit themselves against the most brutal armies of the ancient Americas, armies hundreds of thousands strong. </p>
<p>                    This is a war of gods and men. Dark powers that work behind the scenes of history show their hand as the prophecy of the return of Quetzalcoatl is fulfilled with the arrival of Cortes. The Aztec ruler Moctezuma fights to maintain the demands of the war god Huitzilopochtli for human sacrifice. The Spanish Inquisition is planning an even greater blood-letting. </p>
<p>                    Caught up in the headlong collision between two gods of war are Tozi, Pepillo and the beautiful Malinal whose hatred of Moctezuma runs so deep she will sell out her own land and people to destroy him.</p>

An attractive thirty-two-year-old bachelor, he has been appointed guardian of the young Freddie Armstrong, the eighteen-year-old grandson of his late father&#8217;s dear friend. That&#8217;s bad enough. Then he discovers that the boy is really a girl! It is against all convention and against his personal code to keep a young lady concealed in his own home. He must find a solution.    </p>
<p>                    The earl&#8217;s frequent visitor, Lady Clarissa Rennenord, heartily agrees&#8211;but for less noble reasons. Lady Clarissa hopes to snare the earl in marriage and does not want any competition. She recommends that Freddie be sent to a seminary. No one but Lady Rennenord knows what a horrid place it is&#8211;and no one, including Lady Rennenord, expects Freddie to escape. Now Freddie is back, and the earl finds her presence unsettling in more ways than one.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is finally looking up for the poor relations. The Prince of Wales&#8217; coat of arms gleams over the hotel entrance. All but one of the rooms are filled by the open-handed Prince Hugo and his entourage. The owners have taken on a new partner, Mr. Jason Davy, a popular actor. Even curmudgeonly Sir Philip hasn&#8217;t uttered anything loathsome for days. They have finally reached a position comfortable enough to allow them to consider offers to buy the hotel.    </p>
<p>                    The poor relations&#8217; hard-earned success, however, is in stark contrast to the plight of their latest guest, Lady Jane Fremney. The slight, beautiful youngest daughter of the Earl of Durby has been cast out of her family for refusing to marry the man her father has chosen. Lonely and bankrupt, Lady Jane has decided to commit suicide. But when Miss Tonks uncovers her plans, the poor relations go into action again to rescue Lady Jane from suicide, her father, and her intended husband.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First published in the United States in 1949 and widely condemned as obscene, The Egyptian outsold every other novel published that year, and remains a classic; readers worldwide have testified to its life-changing power. It is a full-bodied re-creation of a largely forgotten era in the world s history: the Egypt of the 14th century B.C.E., when pharaohs and gods contended with the near-collapse of history s greatest empire. This epic tale encompasses the whole of the then-known world, from Babylon to Crete, from Thebes to Jerusalem, while centering around one unforgettable figure: Sinuhe, a man of mysterious origins who rises from the depths of degradation to become personal physician to Pharaoh Akhnaton.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National Book Awards Popular Fiction Book of the Year 2013</p>
<p>                    They lied to protect their country. He told the truth to save it. A gripping historical thriller from the bestselling author of FATHERLAND.</p>
<p>                    January 1895. On a freezing morning in the heart of Paris, an army officer, Georges Picquart, witnesses a convicted spy, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, being publicly humiliated in front of twenty thousand spectators baying &#8216;Death to the Jew!&#8217;</p>
<p>                    The officer is rewarded with promotion: Picquart is made the French army&#8217;s youngest colonel and put in command of &#8216;the Statistical Section&#8217; &#8211; the shadowy intelligence unit that tracked down Dreyfus.</p>
<p>                    The spy, meanwhile, is given a punishment of medieval cruelty: Dreyfus is shipped off to a lifetime of solitary confinement on Devil&#8217;s Island &#8211; unable to speak to anyone, not even his guards, his case seems closed forever.</p>
<p>                    But gradually Picquart comes to believe there is something rotten at the heart of the Statistical Section. When he discovers another German spy operating on French soil, his superiors are oddly reluctant to pursue it. Despite official warnings, Picquart persists, and soon the officer and the spy are in the same predicament&#8230;</p>
<p>                    Narrated by Picquart, An Officer and a Spy is a compelling recreation of a scandal that became the most famous miscarriage of justice in history. Compelling, too, are the echoes for our modern world: an intelligence agency gone rogue, justice corrupted in the name of national security, a newspaper witch-hunt of a persecuted minority, and the age-old instinct of those in power to cover-up their crimes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times Number One Bestseller and Richard and Judy Book Club selection.</p>
<p>                    Seductive, exhilarating and suspenseful, The Muse is an unforgettable novel about aspiration and identity, love and obsession, authenticity and deception &#8211; a masterpiece from Jessie Burton, the million-copy bestselling author of The Miniaturist.</p>
<p>                    A picture hides a thousand words . . .</p>
<p>                    On a hot July day in 1967, Odelle Bastien climbs the stone steps of the Skelton gallery in London, knowing that her life is about to change forever. Having struggled to find her place in the city since she arrived from Trinidad five years ago, she has been offered a job as a typist under the tutelage of the glamorous and enigmatic Marjorie Quick. But though Quick takes Odelle into her confidence, and unlocks a potential she didn&#8217;t know she had, she remains a mystery &#8211; no more so than when a lost masterpiece with a secret history is delivered to the gallery.</p>
<p>                    The truth about the painting lies in 1936 and a large house in rural Spain, where Olive Schloss, the daughter of a renowned art dealer, is harbouring ambitions of her own. Into this fragile paradise come artist and revolutionary Isaac Robles and his half-sister Teresa, who immediately insinuate themselves into the Schloss family, with explosive and devastating consequences . . .</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Those who loved The Miniaturist will find here all the cliffhangers, twists and heart-stopping revelations they expected, and in two evocative settings . . . as a study of female creativity, it triumphs&#8217; &#8211; Daily Telegraph</p>

<p>                    Picking up where Fall of Giants, the first novel in the extraordinary Century Trilogy, left off, Winter of the World follows its five interrelated families-American, German, Russian, English, and Welsh-through a time of enormous social, political, and economic turmoil, beginning with the rise of the Third Reich, through the great dramas of World War II, and into the beginning of the long Cold War.    </p>
<p>                     Carla von Ulrich, born of German and English parents, finds her life engulfed by the Nazi tide until daring to commit a deed of great courage and heartbreak . . . . American brothers Woody and Chuck Dewar, each with a secret, take separate paths to momentous events, one in Washington, the other in the bloody jungles of the Pacific . . . .

<p>                    Set in the Irish Midlands in the 1850s, Emma Donoghue&#8217;s The Wonder &#8211; inspired by numerous European and North American cases of &#8216;fasting girls&#8217; between the sixteenth century and the twentieth &#8211; is a psychological thriller about a child&#8217;s murder threatening to happen in slow motion before our eyes. Pitting all the seductions of fundamentalism against sense and love, it is a searing examination of what nourishes us, body and soul.    </p>

<p>                              A hero will be forged from this broken land.<br />
                              As seen on Netflix and BBC around the world.</p>
<p>                              In the battle for power, there can be only one ruler.</p>
<p>                              The ruler of Mercia is dying, leaving no apparent heir. His wife is a born leader, but no woman has ever ruled over an English kingdom. And she is without her greatest warrior and champion, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.</p>
<p>                              An empty throne leaves the kingdom exposed to rival West Saxons and to the Vikings, who are on a bloody rampage once more.</p>
<p>                              A hero is needed, a hero who has been in battle all his life, who can destroy the double threat to Mercia. A hero who will ultimately decide the fate of a nation&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A beautifully evocative reminder of what it means to come back from war and to face the age-old question of whether it is better to have survived or to have died. Highly recommended.&#8221;&#8211;Library Journal, starred review</p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Jennifer Robson and Hazel Gaynor, this unforgettable debut novel is a sweeping tale of forbidden love, profound loss, and the startling truth of the broken families left behind in the wake of World War I.</p>
<p>                    1921. Survivors of the Great War are desperately trying to piece together the fragments of their broken lives. While many have been reunited with their loved ones, Edie&#8217;s husband Francis has not come home. Francis is presumed to have been killed in action, but Edie believes he might still be alive.</p>
<p>                    Harry, Francis&#8217;s brother, was there the day Francis was wounded. He was certain it was a fatal wound&#8211;that he saw his brother die&#8211;but as time passes, Harry begins questioning his memory of what happened. Could Francis, like many soldiers, merely be lost and confused somewhere? Hired by grieving families, Harry returns to the Western Front to photograph gravesites. As he travels through battle-scarred France and Belgium gathering news for British wives and mothers, he searches for evidence of Francis.</p>
<p>                    When Edie receives a mysterious photograph of Francis, she is more convinced than ever he might still be alive. And so, she embarks on a journey in the hope of finding some trace of her husband. Is he truly gone? And if he isn&#8217;t, then why hasn&#8217;t he come home? </p>
<p>                    As Harry and Edie&#8217;s paths converge, they get closer to the truth about Francis and, as they do, are faced with the life-changing impact of the answers they discover. </p>
<p>                    Artful and incredibly moving, The Poppy Wife tells the unforgettable story of the soldiers lost amid the chaos and ruins, and those who were desperate to find them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Jeremy Cole, the legendary doctor and hero of THE PHYSICIAN, left an enduring legacy. From the eleventh century on, the eldest son in each generation of the Cole family has borne the same first name and middle initial and many of these men have followed the medical profession. A few have been blessed with their ancestor&#8217;s diagnostic skill and the &#8216;sixth sense&#8217; they call The Gift, the ability to know instinctively when death is impending.<br />
                             The tragedy of Rob J.&#8217;s life is the deafness of his son, Robert Jefferson Cole, who is called Shaman by everyone who knows him. Shaman&#8217;s life is difficult. First, he must learn to speak so that he can take his place in the hearing world, and then he must fight against the prejudices of a society where physical differences matter. As Shaman struggles to achieve his identity, the Coles, along with the rest of America, are drawn into the conflict between the North and the South.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The one and only Conn Iggulden takes on the story of the mighty Kublai Khan. An epic tale of a great and heroic mind; his action-packed rule; and how in conquering one-fifth of the world&#8217;s inhabited land, he changed the course of history forever. A scholar who conquered an empire larger than those of Alexander or Caesar. A warrior who would rule a fifth of the world with strength and wisdom. A man who betrayed a brother to protect a nation. From a young scholar to one of history&#8217;s most powerful warriors, Conqueror tells the story of Kublai Khan &#8211; an extraordinary man who should be remembered alongside Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte as one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known. It should have been a golden age, with an empire to dwarf the lands won by the mighty Genghis Khan. Instead, the vast Mongol nation is slowly losing ground, swallowed whole by their most ancient enemy. A new generation has arisen, yet the long shadow of the Great Khan still hangs over them all &#8230;Kublai dreams of an empire stretching from sea to sea. But to see it built, this scholar must first learn the art of war.<br />
                    He must take his nation&#8217;s warriors to the ends of the known world. And when he is weary, when he is wounded, he must face his own brothers in bloody civil war.    </p>

<p>                              What if, as Franklin Roosevelt once proposed, Alaska &#8211; and not Israel &#8211; had become the homeland for the Jews after the Second World War? In Michael Chabon&#8217;s Yiddish-speaking &#8216;Alyeska&#8217;, Orthodox gangs in side-curls and knee breeches roam the streets of Sitka, where Detective Meyer Landsman discovers the corpse of a heroin-addled chess prodigy in the flophouse Meyer calls home. Marionette strings stretch back to the hands of charismatic Rebbe Gold, leader of a sect that seems to have drawn its mission statement from the Cosa Nostra. Meyer is determined to unsnarl the meaning behind the murder. Even if that means surrendering his badge and his dignity to the chief of Sitka&#8217;s homicide unit &#8211; his fearsome ex-wife Bina.    </p>
<p>                              A novel of colossal ambition and heart, THE YIDDISH POLICEMEN&#8217;S UNION interweaves a homage to the stylish menace of 1940s film noir with a bittersweet fable of identity, home and faith.</p>
