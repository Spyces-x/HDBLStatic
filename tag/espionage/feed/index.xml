<p>                    The Man with the Golden Gun, Paco Scaramanga, is one of the deadliest hit men in the world and the British Secret Service want him eliminated.    </p>
<p>                    A brainwashed James Bond tried, and failed, to kill his boss, M. It&#8217;s time for him to prove he can be trusted again.<br />
                    Bond finds his man in the sweltering heat of Jamaica. His plan is to infiltrate Scaramanga&#8217;s gang of criminals to get close to the man himself. But if he fails, Bond will be the next target for the golden gun.    </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           &#8216;Bond is a hero for all time&#8217; Jeffrey Deaver    </p>

<p>                    Fresh from Afghanistan, James Bond has been recruited to a new agency. Conceived in the post-9/11 world, it operates independent of Five, Six and the MoD, its very existence deniable. Its aim: to protect the Realm, by any means necessary.    </p>
<p>                    The Night Action alert calls Bond from dinner with a beautiful woman. GCHQ has decrypted an electronic whisper about an attack scheduled for later in the week: casualties estimated in the thousands, British interests adversely affected.    </p>
<p>                    And 007 has been given carte blanche to do whatever it takes to fulfil his mission.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;A man in my line of business shouldn&#8217;t work to a timetable&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Lunch at Scott&#8217;s, a quiet game of golf, a routine social call on his chief M &#8211; James Bond&#8217;s life has begun to fall into a pattern that threatens complacency&#8230;until the sunny afternoon when M is kidnapped and his house staff savagely murdered. The action ricochets across the globe to a volcanic Greek island where, stripped of all professional aids, Bond must avert a world-menacing conspiracy and face unarmed the monstrous devices of the glacial, merciless Colonel Sun.    </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          &#8216;Bond is a hero for all time&#8217; Jeffrey Deaver    </p>

<p>                    Who killed an elderly couple in their Caribbean home?    </p>
<p>                    M knows exactly who did it, but the murderers will most likely escape through a twisted net of global politics.<br />
                    The solution? M. calls in a personal favour from a certain licensed killer who understands the kind of rough justice needed. Bond soon discovers he&#8217;s not the only one on the hunt, and the lines between revenge and justice become blurred&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Also includes the stories that inspired the films Quantum of Solace and From a View to a Kill    </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   &#8216;Bond is a hero for all time&#8217; Jeffrey Deaver    </p>

<p>                    Did J. Edgar Hoover die a natural death? Or was he murdered? When a group of high-minded and high-placed intellectuals known as Inver Brass detect a monstrous threat to the country in Hoover&#8217;s unethical use of his scandal-ridden private files, they decide to do away with him&#8211;quietly, efficiently, with no hint of impropriety. Then bestselling thriller writer Peter Chancellor stumbles onto information that makes his previous books look like harmless fairy tales. Now Chancellor and Inver Brass are on a deadly collision course, spiraling across the globe in an ever-widening arc of violence and terror. All roads lead to a showdown that will rip the nation&#8217;s capital apart&#8211;leaving only one damning document to survive. </p>

<p>                    &#8216;A writer who bests the bestsellers&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    Retired operative Paul Janson is called back to the spy game to settle a personal debt he owes. Peter Novak, the legendary Hungarian immigrant and head of the Liberty Foundation, has been kidnapped and faces execution at the hands of terrorist extremists. It is up to Janson to rescue Novak before he is murdered.       </p>
<p>                    Janson immediately puts together a top team and manages the nearly impossible task of extricating Novak, but something goes horribly wrong &#8211; something that indicates the operation had been compromised from the start &#8211; and only Janson himself survives. Now the major intelligence services think that Janson was responsible for Novak&#8217;s death and are sending their finest operatives after him&#8230;    </p>

<p>                    Reformed from his days of assassination and conspiracy, Paul Janson has a new mission and a new partner. Working with kick-ass sharpshooter Jessica Kincaid, he helps other disenchanted covert operatives to create new lives.

<p>                    Janson takes the job to rescue a doctor who has been kidnapped by West African rebels. At first, it appears that the doctor&#8217;s life was spared in order to treat the rebels&#8217; wounded leader, but when the mission goes haywire, Janson realises he&#8217;s in the middle of something much bigger &#8211; and that he may be fighting for the wrong side&#8230;    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;The real titan of the genre is Robert Ludlum&#8217; GQ</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Watch your back 007 &#8211; Bourne is out to get you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    Jason Bourne pulls a drowning man from a lake &#8211; a man not only freezing, but bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He wakes as an amnesiac, with no memory of who he is or why he was shot&#8230;an eerie reminder of Bourne&#8217;s own past.</p>
<p>                    Meanwhile, Mossad agent Rebekah is so determined to find this man that she&#8217;s gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency and risks a summary execution if caught by her former colleagues. And back in the US, a new agent has been recruited &#8211; but does he have a secret mission of his own?</p>
<p>                    Everything turns on the mysterious amnesiac. Will Bourne learn his identity or will other, powerful forces get to him first?</p>

<p>                    Nicholas Bryson spent years as a deep cover operative for the American secret intelligence group, The Directorate. After a disastrous mission, Bryson was retired to a new identity. Now, years later, his cover is cracked and Bryson learns that The Directorate was not what it claimed to be &#8211; and that he was, in fact, a pawn being used against his country&#8217;s interests. The Directorate is headed for a dangerous endgame, and the CIA recruits Bryson to stop them.      </p>
<p>                    But after years on the sidelines, Bryson&#8217;s field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, his instincts suspect and he no longer knows who &#8211; if anyone &#8211; can be trusted.    </p>

On an island paradise where a beautiful woman might be a spy and every move could be his last, Alex&#8217;s only clue to survival is a single mysterious word: Halidon.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fourth Reich is waiting to arise&#8211;and the only man who can stop it is about to sign its birth certificate. In 1945 the children of the Third Reich were secretly hidden all over the world, to be concealed until they came of age in the 1970s, at which point $780 million would be waiting in a Swiss bank. But all of these elaborate plans need an unsuspecting outsider to set them in motion: Noel Holcroft, the American son of a high-ranking Nazi officer. He has just been shown an incredible document known as the Holcroft Covenant. If he signs, he will inadvertently deal a serious blow to an already fragile world&#8211;and authorize his own death warrant.  Praise for Robert Ludlum and The Holcroft Covenant    </p>

A Serb terrorist, backed by Russians, is on a mission to spirit hazardous vials of deadly bacteria to a U.S. government agent&#8211;a shadowy figure whose motives for acquiring the bioweapon are made all the more unfathomable when both men are found murdered&#8211;and the strain is stolen. Time is running out for Smith and Russell to track it down, find the madman who possesses it, and stop him before he holds a defenseless world hostage with the power to render the human race extinct.    </p>

<p>                    On the dark waterside docks of Shanghai, a photographer records cargo being secretly loaded. He&#8217;s brutally killed and his camera destroyed. Two weeks later on the dangerous high seas, the US Navy covertly tracks a Chinese ship rumoured to carry tons of chemicals to create biological weapons of mass destruction. The President cannot let the ship reach its destination &#8211; a rogue Middle East nation. But he doesn&#8217;t want the navy to attack and board it either, because decades of negotiations with China have at long last yielded a landmark human rights agreement that China is willing to sign.      </p>
<p>                    Covert-One operative Jon Smith is brought in to find solid proof of what the Chinese ship is ferrying. Then an agent is murdered and vital evidence destroyed. Smith must find the truth about the ship, a truth that probes the deepest secrets of the Chinese ruling party&#8230;    </p>

<p>                    A fiery explosion shatters a laboratory building in Paris. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular &#8211; or DNA &#8211; computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in the fire. Then suddenly US fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes and there&#8217;s no explanation; utilities cease to function; and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker &#8211; only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc.    </p>
<p>                    Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to investigate. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, he uncovers a web of deception that threatens to reshape the world for ever&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Autumn 1943. American agent David Spaulding is among the global espionage elite who have converged on Buenos Aires. His top-secret mission can bring World War II to an explosive end. But what happens in this city of assassins, betrayals, and sensual encounters is the most sinister and terrifying deal ever made between two nations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>War hero and infamous ladies&#8217; man General MacKenzie Hawkins is a living legend. His life story has even been sold to Hollywood. But now he stands accused of defacing a historic monument in China&#8217;s Forbidden City. Under house arrest in Peking with a case against him pending in Washington, this looks like the end of Mac&#8217;s illustrious career. But he has a plan of his own: kidnap the Pope. What&#8217;s the ransom? Just one American dollar&#8211;for every Catholic in the world. Add to the mix a slew of shady &#8220;investors,&#8221; Mac&#8217;s four persuasive, well-endowed ex-wives, and a young lawyer and fellow soldier who wants nothing more than to return to private life, and readers have in their hands one relentlessly irreverent page-turner.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On a remote island in the Canadian Arctic, researchers discover the wreckage of a mysterious World War II-era aircraft, a discovery that forces the Russian Federation into a shocking admission. The unmarked plane is a Soviet strategic bomber that disappeared with its crew more than fifty years ago while carrying two metric tons of weaponized anthrax.     </p>
<p>                    Desperate to prevent a political and diplomatic firestorm, the U.S. president dispatches a Covert-One team led by Lieutenant Colonel Jon Smith to the crash site. But others have reached the frigid, windswept island first, including an international arms dealer and his crew of vicious mercenaries. As for the Russians, they are lying: a second, even deadlier secret rests within the hulk of the lost bomber, a secret the Russians are willing to kill to protect. Trapped in a polar wilderness, Smith and his team find themselves fighting a savage war on two front&#8211;against an enemy they can see and another hiding within their own ranks.    </p>

<p>                    When a US Special Forces team is wiped out by a group of normally peaceful farmers in Uganda, Covert-One operative Jon Smith is sent to investigate.     </p>
<p>                    Video of the attack shows even women and children possessing almost supernatural speed and strength, consumed with a rage that makes them immune to pain, fear and all but the most devastating injuries.    </p>
<p>                    Smith finds evidence of a parasitic infection that for centuries has been causing violent insanity and then going dormant. This time, though, it&#8217;s different. And as Smith and his team are cut off from all outside support, they begin to suspect that forces much closer to home are in play&#8230;    </p>

Among the kidnapped is Nick Rendel, a computer software coding expert in charge of drone programming and strategy. He is the victim with the most dangerous knowledge, including confidential passwords and codes that are used to program the drones. If revealed, his kidnappers could reprogram the drones to strike targets within the United States.</p>
<p>                    Jon Smith and the Covert-One team begin a worldwide search to recover the officials, but as the first kidnapping victims are rescued, they show disturbing signs of brainwashing or mind-altering drugs. Smith&#8217;s investigation leads him to Fort Detrick, where a researcher, Dr Laura Taylor, had been attempting to create a drug to wipe memory from soldiers suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome. But Dr Taylor&#8217;s research was suspended almost a year ago, when she was placed in a mental institution. Now, if Smith doesn&#8217;t figure out the brainwashing drug, and track down the kidnapped Nick Rendel, the kidnappers will soon have the power to carry out drone strikes anywhere in the world&#8230;</p>

Aquitaine!&#8221; Suddenly Converse is running for his life, alone with the world&#8217;s most shattering secret. Pursued by anonymous executioners to the dark corners of Europe, he is forced to play a game of survival by blood rules he thought he&#8217;d long left behind. One by one, he traces each thread of a lethal progression to the heart of every major government, a network of coordinated global violence that no one believes possible&#8211;no one but Converse and the woman he once loved and lost, the only two people on earth who can wrest the world from the iron grasp of Aquitaine.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Cold War thriller from the master of spy fiction, John le Carre&#8217;s The Looking Glass War is a gripping novel of double-crosses, audacious bluffs and the ever-present threat of nuclear war, published in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>
<p>                    When the Department &#8211; faded since the war and busy only with bureaucratic battles &#8211; hears rumour of a missile base near the West German border, it seems like the perfect opportunity to regain some political standing in the Intelligence market place. The Cold War is at its height and the Department is dying for a piece of the action.</p>
<p>                    Swiftly becoming carried away by fear and pride, the Department and her officers send deactivated agent Fred Leiser back into East Germany, armed only with some schoolboy training and his memories of the war. In the land of eloquent silence that is Communist East Germany, Leiser&#8217;s fate becomes inseparable from the Department&#8217;s.</p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed The Looking Glass War, you might like le Carre&#8217;s The Secret Pilgrim, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>

<p>                    Twenty years ago, KGB and CIA agents worked together to bring down The Matarese, a dynasty of killers who threatened the world. But the terrifying group has regained its power.     </p>
<p>                    CIA officer Cameron Pryce is hot on the trail of the new Matarese alliance. His only chance to terminate its ruthless activities is to follow the trail of blood money and stone-cold killers. Then he gets a lucky break. One of the Matarese victims lives long enough to whisper dying words that will blow the case wide open: the code name for legendary CIA agent Brandon Scofield &#8211; the only man to infiltrate the Matarese circle, and survive.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author, Eric Van Lustbader, returns with another Jason Bourne thriller as he spars off against another deadly agent&#8211;and he might be the perfect match for Bourne.<br />
                     Facing down mercenaries in Africa, Jason Bourne witnesses the death of an art dealer named Tracy Atherton. Her killing dredges up snatches of Bourne&#8217;s impaired memory, in particular the murder of a young woman on Bali who entrusted him with a strangely engraved ring-an artifact of such powerful significance that people have killed to obtain it. Now he&#8217;s determined to find the ring&#8217;s owner and purpose. But Bourne never knows what terrible acts he&#8217;ll discover he committed when he digs into the past. </p>
<p>                     The trail will lead him through layers of conspiracy to a vicious Russian mercenary, Leonid Arkadin, who was also a graduate of the Central Intelligence training program Treadstone. A covert course designed to create ruthless assassins for C.I., it was shuttered by Congress for corruption. Yet before it was dismantled, it produced Bourne and Arkadin, giving them equal skills, equal force, and equal cunning. </p>
<p>                     As Bourne&#8217;s destiny circles closer to Arkadin&#8217;s, it becomes clear that the eventual collision of these men is not of their own making. Someone else has been watching and manipulating them. Someone who wants to know, Who is the more deadly agent?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Night Manager, John le Carre&#8217;s first post-Cold War novel, an ex-soldier helps British Intelligence penetrate the secret world of ruthless arms dealers.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Le Carre is the equal of any novelist now writing in English&#8217;  Guardian</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A marvellously observed relentless tale&#8217;  Observer </p>
<p>                    At the start of it all, Jonathan Pine is merely the night manager at a luxury hotel. But when a single attempt to pass on information to the British authorities &#8211; about an international businessman at the hotel with suspicious dealings &#8211; backfires terribly, and people close to Pine begin to die, he commits himself to a battle against powerful forces he cannot begin to imagine.</p>
<p>                    In a chilling tale of corrupt intelligence agencies, billion-dollar price tags and the truth of the brutal arms trade, John le Carre creates a claustrophobic world in which no one can be trusted.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Complex and intense &#8230; page-turning tension&#8217;  San Francisco Chronicle</p>
<p>                    &#8216;When I was under house arrest I was helped by the books of John le Carre &#8230; they were a journey into the wider world &#8230; These were the journeys that made me feel that I was not really cut off from the rest of humankind&#8217; Aung San Suu Kyi</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of those writers who will be read a century from now&#8217; Robert Harris</p>
<p>                    &#8216;He can communicate emotion, from sweating fear to despairing love, with terse and compassionate conviction&#8217; Sunday Times (on The Spy Who Came in from the Cold)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Return of the master . . . Having plumbed the devious depths of the Cold War, le Carre has done it again for our nasty new age&#8217; The Times (on Our Kind of Traitor)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first of his peerless novels of Cold War espionage and international intrigue, Call for the Dead is also the debut of John le Carre&#8217;s masterful creation George Smiley. </p>
<p>                    After a routine security check by George Smiley, civil servant Samuel Fennan apparently kills himself. When Smiley finds Circus head Maston is trying to blame him for the man&#8217;s death, he begins his own investigation, meeting with Fennan&#8217;s widow to find out what could have led him to such desperation. But on the very day that Smiley is ordered off the enquiry he receives an urgent letter from the dead man. Do the East Germans &#8211; and their agents &#8211; know more about this man&#8217;s death than the Circus previously imagined? Le Carre&#8217;s first book, Call for the Dead, introduced the tenacious and retiring George Smiley in a gripping tale of espionage and deceit.</p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed Call for the Dead, you might like le Carre&#8217;s The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>

<p>                    Tessa Quayle, a brilliant and beautiful young social activist, has been found brutally murdered by Lake Turkana in Nairobi.

<p>                    The Cold War is over and Ned has been demoted to the training academy. He asks his old mentor, George Smiley, to address his passing-out class. There are no laundered reminiscences; Smiley speaks the truth &#8211; perhaps the last the students will ever hear. As they listen, Ned recalls his own painful triumphs and inglorious failures, in a career that took him from the Western Isles of Scotland to Hamburg and from Israel to Cambodia. He asks himself: Did it do any good? What did it do to me? And what will happen to us now? In this late Smiley novel, the great spy gives his own humane and unexpected answers.    </p>

How can a down-at-heel magician in Devon explain the vast fortune that has mysteriously appeared in his daughter&#8217;s trust fund?

<p>                     In this exquisitely told novel, John le Carre shows us once again his acute understanding of the world we live in and where power really lies.    </p>
<p>                     In the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and with Britain on the brink of economic ruin, a young English couple takes a vacation in Antigua. There they meet Dima, a Russian who styles himself the world&#8217;s Number One money-launderer and who wants, among other things, a game of tennis. Back in London, the couple is subjected to an interrogation by the British Secret service who also need their help. Their acquiescence will lead them on a precarious journey through Paris to a safe house in Switzerland, helpless pawns in a game of nations that reveals the unholy alliances between the Russian mafia, the City of London, the government and the competing factions of the British Secret Service.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John le Carre&#8217;s first post-glasnost spy novel, The Russia House captures the effect of a slow and uncertain thaw on ordinary people and on the shadowy puppet-masters who command them</p>
<p>                    Barley Blair is not a Service man: he is a small-time publisher, a self-destructive soul whose only loves are whisky and jazz. But it was Barley who, one drunken night at a dacha in Peredelkino during the Moscow Book Fair, was befriended by a high-ranking Soviet scientist who could be the greatest asset to the West since perestroika began, and made a promise. Nearly a year later, his drunken promise returns to haunt him. A reluctant Barley is quickly trained by British Intelligence and sent to Moscow to liaise with a go-between, the beautiful Katya. Both are lonely and disillusioned. Each is increasingly certain that if the human race is to have any future, all must betray their countries &#8230;</p>

<p>                    Before Bourne can decipher this enigmatic warning, Karpov&#8217;s wedding ends in chaos and bloodshed.

<p>                    After a routine security check by George Smiley, civil servant Samuel Fennan apparently kills himself. When Smiley finds Circus head Maston is trying to blame him for the man&#8217;s death, he begins his own investigation, meeting with Fennan&#8217;s widow to find out what could have led him to such desperation. But on the very day that Smiley is ordered off the enquiry he receives an urgent letter from the dead man. Do the East Germans &#8211; and their agents &#8211; know more about this man&#8217;s death than the Circus previously imagined? Le Carre&#8217;s first book, Call for the Dead, introduced the tenacious and retiring George Smiley in a gripping tale of espionage and deceit.</p>

This Penguin Modern Classics edition includes an afterword by the author and an introduction by William Boyd, author of Any Human Heart.</p>
<p>                    Alec Leamas is tired. It&#8217;s the 1960s, he&#8217;s been out in the cold for years, spying in the shadow of the Berlin Wall for his British masters. He has seen too many good agents murdered for their troubles. Now Control wants to bring him in at last &#8211; but only after one final assignment. He must travel deep into the heart of Communist Germany and betray his country, a job that he will do with his usual cynical professionalism. But when George Smiley tries to help a young woman Leamas has befriended, Leamas&#8217;s mission may prove to be the worst thing he could ever have done. In le Carre&#8217;s breakthrough work of 1963, the spy story is reborn as a gritty and terrible tale of men who are caught up in politics beyond their imagining. </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A portrait of a man who has lived by lies and subterfuge for so long, he&#8217;s forgotten how to tell the truth&#8217;<br />

<p>                    In his final hours in office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison. What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems that Backman, in his heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world&#8217;s most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.     </p>
<p>                    Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive&#8211;there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, Who will kill him?    </p>

Alan Turner of the Foreign Office must travel to Bonn to recover them.  As he gets closer to the truth of Harting&#8217;s disappearance, he will  discover that the face of Cold War Europe &#8211; and the attentions of the  British Ministry itself &#8211; are far uglier that he could possibly have  imagined.    </p>
<p>                      Le Carre&#8217;s searing Cold War novel creates a world  where the lines between right and wrong, good and evil, are horribly  blurred.    </p>

<p>                    The Cold War is over and retired secret servant Tim Cranmer has been put out to pasture, spending his days making wine on his Somerset estate. But then he discovers that his former double agent Larry  &#8211; dreamer, dissolute, philanderer and disloyal friend &#8211; has vanished, along with Tim&#8217;s mistress.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Cold War thriller from the master of spy fiction, John le Carre&#8217;s The Looking Glass War is a gripping novel of double-crosses, audacious bluffs and the ever-present threat of nuclear war, published in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>
<p>                    When the Department &#8211; faded since the war and busy only with bureaucratic battles &#8211; hears rumour of a missile base near the West German border, it seems like the perfect opportunity to regain some political standing in the Intelligence market place. The Cold War is at its height and the Department is dying for a piece of the action.</p>
<p>                    Swiftly becoming carried away by fear and pride, the Department and her officers send deactivated agent Fred Leiser back into East Germany, armed only with some schoolboy training and his memories of the war. In the land of eloquent silence that is Communist East Germany, Leiser&#8217;s fate becomes inseparable from the Department&#8217;s.</p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed The Looking Glass War, you might like le Carre&#8217;s The Secret Pilgrim, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the second part of John le Carre&#8217;s Karla Trilogy, the battle of wits between spymaster George Smiley and his Russian adversary takes on an even more dangerous dimension.</p>
<p>                     As the fall of Saigon looms, master spy George Smiley must outmaneuver his Soviet counterpart on a battlefield that neither can afford to lose.</p>
<p>                     The mole has been eliminated, but the damage wrought has brought the British Secret Service to its knees. Given the charge of the gravely compromised Circus, George Smiley embarks on a campaign to uncover what Moscow Centre most wants to hide. When the trail goes cold at a Hong Kong gold seam, Smiley dispatches Gerald Westerby to shake the money tree. A part-time operative with cover as a philandering journalist, Westerby insinuates himself into a war-torn world where allegiances-and lives-are bought and sold.</p>
<p>                    Brilliantly plotted and morally complex, The Honourable Schoolboy is the second installment of John le Carre&#8217;s renowned Karla triology and a riveting portrayal of postcolonial espionage.</p>
<p>                     With an introduction by the author.</p>

<p>                    He was dragged from the sea, his body riddled with bullets. There are a few clues: a frame of microfilm surgically implanted beneath the skin of his hip; evidence that plastic surgery has altered his face; strange things he says in his delirium, which could be code words. And a number on the film negative that leads to a bank account in Zurich, four million dollars and a name for the amnesiac: Jason Bourne.    </p>
<p>                    Now he is running for his life. A man with an unknown past and an uncertain future, the target of assassins and at the heart of a deadly puzzle. He&#8217;s fighting for survival and no one can help him &#8211; except the one woman who once wanted to escape him &#8230;    </p>

<p>                     Over the course of his seemingly irreproachable life, Magnus Pym has been all things to all people: a devoted family man, a trusted colleague, a loyal friend-and the perfect spy. But in the wake of his estranged father&#8217;s death, Magnus vanishes, and the British Secret Service is up in arms. Is it grief, or is the reason for his disappearance more sinister? And who is the mysterious man with the sad moustache who also seems to be looking for Magnus?    </p>
<p>                     In A Perfect Spy, John le Carre has crafted one of his crowning masterpieces, interweaving a moving and unusual coming-of-age story with a morally tangled chronicle of modern espionage.    </p>

<p>                    Barley Blair is not a Service man: he is a small-time publisher, a self-destructive soul whose only loves are whisky and jazz. But it was Barley who, one drunken night at a dacha in Peredelkino during the Moscow Book Fair, was befriended by a high-ranking Soviet scientist who could be the greatest asset to the West since perestroika began, and made a promise. Nearly a year later, his drunken promise returns to haunt him. A reluctant Barley is quickly trained by British Intelligence and sent to Moscow to liaise with a go-between, the beautiful Katya. Both are lonely and disillusioned. Each is increasingly certain that if the human race is to have any future, all must betray their countries &#8230;</p>

<p>                    Paul Janson has set a new mission for himself. In partnership with champion sharpshooter Jessica Kincaid, he rehabilitates disenchanted agents, helping them to create new lives outside the violent intelligence sector.    </p>
<p>                    But he still takes on independent assignments &#8211; for a fee. So when an oil executive begs Janson to rescue his wife, Allegra, from Somali pirates, Janson and Kincaid take on the case.    </p>
<p>                    However, pirates are the least of their worries in the violent chaos of oil-rich East Africa. And when Janson and Kincaid stumble into a bewildering storm of plots and counter plots, they begin to fear the only way to escape would be to abandon the kidnapped Allegra.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Union is a criminal organization with tentacles throughout the world, specializing in military espionage, theft, intimidation, and murder. After one of its agents assassinates Bond&#8217;s friend and host at a glittering dinner in the Bahamas, the Union becomes 007&#8217;s priority target.     </p>
<p>                    When information vital to Britain&#8217;s national security is stolen, both M and Bond suspect that the Union is behind it. The trail leads Bond from one of England&#8217;s most exclusive golf clubs to the cosmopolitan city of Brussels and finally to an expedition up the icy heights of the legendary mountain Kangchenjunga, the third tallest peak in the world. Led by the abrasive mountaineer Group Captain Roland Marquis, aided by the expedition&#8217;s beautiful doctor, Hope Kendall, and opposed by an unknown traitor working out of SIS itself, Bond must pit his strength and guile against two deadly adversaries&#8211;the forces of nature at high altitude and the most resourceful criminal minds he has ever encountered.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The eighth of John le Carre&#8217;s espionage novels to feature his most enduring and well-loved character, George Smiley, and a gripping feat of narrative brilliance, The Secret Pilgrim is published in Penguin Modern Classics with an afterword by the author.    </p>
<p>                    The Cold War is over and Ned has been demoted to the training academy. He asks his old mentor, George Smiley, to address his passing-out class. There are no laundered reminiscences; Smiley speaks the truth &#8211; perhaps the last the students will ever hear. As they listen, Ned recalls his own painful triumphs and inglorious failures, in a career that took him from the Western Isles of Scotland to Hamburg and from Israel to Cambodia. He asks himself: Did it do any good? What did it do to me? And what will happen to us now? In this late Smiley novel, the great spy gives his own humane and unexpected answers.    </p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed The Secret Pilgrim, you might like le Carre&#8217;s The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Consummate and enthralling&#8217;<br />

<p>                    To do it, Jaeger assembles an expert team of ex-SAS soldiers. They must head deep into the Amazon rainforest. It seems his friend was on the trail of an old Nazi bomber.</p>

<p>                    Everything is connected. And, for one man, the War never ended . . .</p>
<p>                    A modern, edge-of-your-seat thriller, shrouded in the shadows cast by Nazi Germany. Great for fans of Gregg Hurwitz, James Swallow, and I Am Pilgrim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chosen as a Book of the Year in The Times Literary Supplement, the Evening Standard, the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A brilliant novel of deception, love and trust to join his supreme cannon&#8217; Evening Standard</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Vintage le Carre. Immensely clever, breathtaking. Really, not since The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has le Carre exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect&#8217; John Banville, Guardian</p>
<p>                    Peter Guillam, former disciple of George Smiley in the British Secret Service, has long retired to Brittany when a letter arrives, summoning him to London. The reason? Cold War ghosts have come back to haunt him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of the Service are to be dissected by a generation with no memory of the Berlin Wall.  Somebody must pay for innocent blood spilt in the name of the greater good . . .</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Utterly engrossing and perfectly pitched. There is only one le Carre. Eloquent, subtle, sublimely paced&#8217;  Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Splendid, fast-paced, riveting&#8217; Andrew Marr, Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Remarkable. It gives the reader, at long last, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that have been missing for 54 years. Like wine, le Carre&#8217;s writing has got richer with age&#8217;  The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perhaps the most significant novelist of the second half of the 20th century in Britain. He&#8217;s in the first rank&#8217;  Ian McEwan</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of those writers who will be read a century from now&#8217;  Robert Harris</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-CIA master assassin Court Gentry gets hit with a blast from the past in the fourth Gray Man novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Mark Greaney.    </p>
<p>                    Court Gentry has always prided himself on his ability to disappear at will, to fly below the radar and exist in the shadows-to survive as the near-mythical Gray Man. But when he takes revenge upon a former employer who betrayed him, he exposes himself to something he&#8217;s never had to face before: a killer who is just like him.    </p>
<p>                    Code-named Dead Eye, Russell Whitlock is a graduate of the same ultra-secret Autonomous Asset Program that trained and once controlled Gentry. But now, Whitlock is a free agent who has been directed to terminate his fellow student of death. He knows how his target thinks, how he moves, and how he kills. And he knows the best way to do the job is to make Gentry run for his life-right up until the moment Dead Eye finally ends it&#8230;    </p>

<p>                    The first in the Court Gentry all-action thriller series, from Tom Clancy&#8217;s co-writer Mark Greaney.</p>
<p>                    To those who lurk in the shadows, he&#8217;s known as the Gray Man. He is a legend in the covert realm, moving silently from job to job, accomplishing the impossible and then fading away. And he always hits his target. </p>
<p>                    But there are forces more lethal than Gentry in the world. Forces like money. And power. And there are men who hold these as the only currency worth fighting for. In their eyes, Gentry has just outlived his usefulness.</p>
<p>                    But Court Gentry is going to prove that, for him, there&#8217;s no grey area between killing for a living and killing to stay alive&#8230;</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Take fictional spy Jason Bourne, pump him up with Red Bull and meth, shake vigorously-and you&#8217;ve got the recipe for Court Gentry.&#8217; The Memphis Commercial Appeal</p>
<p>                    &#8216;From the opening pages, the bullets fly and the bodies pile up. Through the carnage, Gentry remains an intriguing protagonist with his own moral code.&#8217; Booklist</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mark Greaney, the #1 New York Times bestselling author of Tom Clancy&#8217;s recent Jack Ryan novels, delivers another breakneck thriller following the world&#8217;s deadliest assassin &#8211; the Gray Man.    </p>
<p>                    After five years on the run, &#8216;The Gray Man&#8217; &#8211; Court Gentry &#8211; is back on the inside at the CIA. His first mission makes him wish he wasn&#8217;t, when a pair of Chinese agents try to take him down in Hong Kong. Normally the Chinese stay eyes-only on foreign agents &#8211; why are they on such high alert?     </p>
<p>                    Court&#8217;s high-stakes hunt leads to an old friend, Donald Fitzroy, who is being held hostage by the Chinese. Fitzroy was contracted to find Fan Jiang, a former member of an ultra-secret unit responsible for testing China&#8217;s security systems. But Fan was too good at his job . . .    </p>
<p>                    The first two teams Fitzroy sent to find Fan have disappeared and the Chinese have decided to &#8216;supervise&#8217; the next operation. What they don&#8217;t know is that Gentry&#8217;s mission is to find Fan first and get his intel to the US &#8211; and get out alive . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moscow, 1965. Former Secret Service agent Leo Demidov is forbidden to travel with his wife and daughters to New York as part of a &#8216;Peace Tour&#8217;, meant to foster better relations between the two Cold War enemies. Leo&#8217;s natural paranoia reaches its peak: Why have his family been selected? What is being planned?     </p>
<p>                    When Leo&#8217;s worst fears are realised and a tragic murder destroys everything he loves, he demands only one thing: that he is allowed to investigate and find the killer who has struck at the heart of his family. Crippled by grief, his request denied, Leo sees no other option than to take matters into his own hands, thousands of miles from the crime scene.     </p>
<p>                    In a surprising, thrilling story that spans decades and continents &#8211; from the backstreets of 1960s New York to the mountains of Afghanistan in the 1980s &#8211; Leo will stop at nothing as he hunts the one person who knows the truth: Agent 6.    </p>

<p>                     Court Gentry is back in action. This time he&#8217;s working on behalf of a well-connected group of Syrian expats to secure the Syrian president&#8217;s mistress so they can use her to bring down the president&#8217;s regime. But the expats&#8217; plan goes awry when it&#8217;s discovered the mistress has a baby&#8211;the Syrian president&#8217;s only male heir&#8211;hidden away in a Damascus safe house.</p>
<p>                     Court goes after the baby, a decision that comes at the price of the mistress&#8217;s life. The expat organization deems the boy now useless to their cause and refuses to protect him against the Syrian first lady and the notorious Swiss assassin in her employ. With no support on the way, Court realizes he&#8217;ll have to take down the Syrian president himself if he and the boy are going to make it out alive&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert Ludlum&#8217;s wayward hero, the outrageous General MacKenzie Hawkins, returns with a diabolical scheme to right a very old wrong&#8211;and wreak vengeance on the [redacted] who drummed him out of the military. Discovering a long-buried 1878 treaty with an obscure Indian tribe, the Hawk, a.k.a. Chief Thunder Head, hatches a brilliant plot that will ultimately bring him and his reluctant legal eagle, Sam Devereaux, before the Supreme Court. Their goal is to reclaim a choice piece of American real estate: the state of Nebraska, which just so happens to be the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Air Command. Their outraged opposition will be no less than the CIA, the Pentagon, and the White House. And only one thing is certain: Ludlum will keep us in nonstop suspense&#8211;and side-splitting laughter&#8211;through the very last page.     </p>
<p>                     Praise for Robert Ludlum and The Road to Omaha    </p>

<p>                    Two female agents of Operation Cream Cake &#8211; double agents and honey traps against the KGB &#8211; are murdered. Bond must find the others and conduct them to safety before they meet a similar fate.    </p>
<p>                    In a race against time, Bond travels to Ireland and the KGB is soon on the scene. But all is not as it seems and soon Bond finds he needs all his wits to negotiate a labyrinth of double-crossing that is to lead him to a bewildering showdown in a remote corner of the Kowloon province of Hong Kong, where, weaponless, he is hunted by four assassins.    </p>
<p>                    No Deals, Mr. Bond is the sixth in the bestselling series created by John Gardner, and one of the most original and unpredictable.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;No other writer has charted &#8211; pitilessly for politicians but thrillingly for readers &#8211; the public and secret histories of his times&#8217; Guardian<br />
                    ________________________________</p>
<p>                    Nat, a 47 year-old veteran of Britain&#8217;s Secret Intelligence Service, believes his years as an agent runner are over.  He is back in London with his wife, the long-suffering Prue.  But with the growing threat from Moscow Centre, the office has one more job for him.  Nat is to take over The Haven, a defunct substation of London General with a rag-tag band of spies.  The only bright light on the team is young Florence, who has her eye on Russia Department and a Ukrainian oligarch with a finger in the Russia pie.  </p>
<p>                    Nat is not only a spy, he is a passionate badminton player.  His regular Monday evening opponent is half his age:  the introspective and solitary Ed.  Ed hates Brexit, hates Trump and hates his job at some soulless media agency.  And it is Ed, of all unlikely people, who will take Prue, Florence and Nat himself down the path of political anger that will ensnare them all.  Agent Running in the Field is a chilling portrait of our time, now heartbreaking, now darkly humorous, told to us with unflagging tension by the greatest chronicler of our age.<br />

<p>                    After Court Gentry was betrayed by his compatriots and forced to take on a near-suicidal covert mission by the CIA, he thought he could find refuge living in  the Amazon rain forest. But his bloody past finds him when a vengeful  Russian crime lord forces him to go on the run once again. Court makes  his way to one of the only men in the world he can trust-and arrives  too late. His friend is dead and buried.    </p>
<p>                    Years before, Eddie Gamboa had saved Court&#8217;s life. Now, Eddie has  been murdered by the notorious Mexican drug cartel he fought to take  down. And Court soon finds himself drawn into a war he never wanted.  But in this war, there are no sides-only survivors&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Official, original James Bond from a writer described by Len Deighton as a &#8216;master storyteller&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    In different corners of the world four high-profile figures are assassinated in less than a week. Nobody links the deaths but one thing is certain: each of them has been stalked, sought out and killed with care and preparation. Then a sinister connection is established: a single, blood-tipped rose is sent to each funeral and an unremarkable female agent is murdered in Switzerland.    </p>
<p>                    When MI5 come to MI6 to ask for help M brings in his best. At first, a weekend abroad seems tempting to James Bond: especially when he&#8217;s paired with Flicka von Grusse, a gorgeous Swiss intelligence officer. But this is a perilous assignment that starts with the mysterious actor David Dragonpol and leads them to Athens, Milan and on to EuroDisney &#8230; and an explosive climax.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Mark Greaney, the #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Tom Clancy&#8217;s Jack Ryan novels, comes the fifth explosive thriller featuring the lethal assassin known as the Gray Man&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Five years ago, Court Gentry was the CIA&#8217;s best covert asset. Then, without warning, his masters at the Agency put him at the top of their kill list. Court fled his country and became an enigmatic killer for hire known as the Gray Man.     </p>
<p>                    Determined to find out what made the Agency turn against him, he plans to get his hands on the men who sent him on his last mission, Operation BACK BLAST. What he doesn&#8217;t realize is that the questions that arose from his time as an American assassin are still reverberating in the U.S. intelligence community, and he&#8217;s stumbled onto a secret that powerful people want kept under wraps.     </p>
<p>                    The result: everyone has Court in their crosshairs&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the best thriller writers on the planet.&#8221; &#8211;The Real Book Spy </p>
<p>                    In the next thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling Mitch Rapp series, it&#8217;s a race against the clock when ISIS takes out the entire US power grid and throws the country into chaos. </p>
<p>                    When Mitch Rapp captures ISIS&#8217;s top technology expert, he reveals that he was on his way to meet a man who claims to have the ability to bring down America&#8217;s power grid. Rapp is determined to eliminate this shadowy figure, but the CIA&#8217;s trap fails. </p>
<p>                    The Agency is still trying to determine what went wrong when ISIS operatives help this cyber terrorist do what he said he could&#8211;plunge the country into darkness. With no concept of how this unprecedented act was accomplished, the task of getting the power back on could take months. Perhaps even years. </p>
<p>                    Rapp and his team embark on a desperate search for the only people who know how to repair the damage&#8211;the ones responsible. But his operating environment is like nothing he&#8217;s experienced before. Computers and communication networks are down, fuel can no longer be pumped from gas stations, water and sanitation systems are on the brink of collapse, and the supply of food is running out. </p>
<p>                    Can Rapp get the lights back on before America descends irretrievably into chaos? </p>
<p>                    This compulsive thriller proves once again that the Mitch Rapp series is &#8220;the best of the best when it comes to the world of special ops&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>National Book Awards Popular Fiction Book of the Year 2013</p>
<p>                    They lied to protect their country. He told the truth to save it. A gripping historical thriller from the bestselling author of FATHERLAND.</p>
<p>                    January 1895. On a freezing morning in the heart of Paris, an army officer, Georges Picquart, witnesses a convicted spy, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, being publicly humiliated in front of twenty thousand spectators baying &#8216;Death to the Jew!&#8217;</p>
<p>                    The officer is rewarded with promotion: Picquart is made the French army&#8217;s youngest colonel and put in command of &#8216;the Statistical Section&#8217; &#8211; the shadowy intelligence unit that tracked down Dreyfus.</p>
<p>                    The spy, meanwhile, is given a punishment of medieval cruelty: Dreyfus is shipped off to a lifetime of solitary confinement on Devil&#8217;s Island &#8211; unable to speak to anyone, not even his guards, his case seems closed forever.</p>
<p>                    But gradually Picquart comes to believe there is something rotten at the heart of the Statistical Section. When he discovers another German spy operating on French soil, his superiors are oddly reluctant to pursue it. Despite official warnings, Picquart persists, and soon the officer and the spy are in the same predicament&#8230;</p>
<p>                    Narrated by Picquart, An Officer and a Spy is a compelling recreation of a scandal that became the most famous miscarriage of justice in history. Compelling, too, are the echoes for our modern world: an intelligence agency gone rogue, justice corrupted in the name of national security, a newspaper witch-hunt of a persecuted minority, and the age-old instinct of those in power to cover-up their crimes.</p>

Beyond the corridors of official power he discovers a nightmare maze where billionaires mingle with Mafia dons, where sinister forces are poised to enact a chilling conspiracy, where Congress and even the presidency itself can be bought and sold, where survival hinges on a hair trigger. In this world, a man like Trevayne can easily become a pawn, an enemy&#8211;or a king. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dazzling speculative novel of &#8216;counterfactual history&#8217; from one of America&#8217;s most highly-regarded science fiction authors, Philip K. Dick&#8217;s The Man in the High Castle includes an introduction by Eric Brown in Penguin Modern Classics.</p>
<p>                    Philip K. Dick&#8217;s acclaimed cult novel gives us a horrifying glimpse of an alternative world &#8211; one where the Allies have lost the Second World War. In this nightmare dystopia the Nazis have taken over New York, the Japanese control California and the African continent is virtually wiped out. In a neutral buffer zone in America that divides the world&#8217;s new rival superpowers, lives the author of an underground bestseller. His book offers a new vision of reality &#8211; an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers were defeated &#8211; giving hope to the disenchanted. Does &#8216;reality&#8217; lie with him, or is his world just one among many others?</p>
<p>                    Philip Kindred Dick (1928-82) was born in Chicago in 1928. His career as a science fiction writer comprised an early burst of short stories followed by a stream of novels, typically character studies incorporating androids, drugs, and hallucinations. His best works are generally agreed to be The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner.</p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed The Man in the High Castle, you might like Yevgeny Zamyatin&#8217;s We, also available in Penguin Classics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spook Country &#8211; a gripping spy thriller by William Gibson, bestselling author of Neuromancer</p>
<p>                    What happens when old spies come out to play one last game?</p>
<p>                    In New York a young Cuban called Tito is passing iPods to a mysterious old man. Such activities do not go unnoticed, however, in these early days of the War on Terror and across the city an ex-military man named Brown is tracking Tito&#8217;s movements. Meanwhile in LA, journalist Hollis Henry is on the trail of Bobby Chombo, who appears to know too much about military systems for his own good. With Bobby missing and the trail cold, Hollis digs deeper and is drawn into the final moves of a chilling game played out by men with old scores to settle . . . </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A cool, sophisticated thriller&#8217; Financial Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Among our most fascinating novelists &#8230; unmissable&#8217; Daily Telegraph</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I&#8217;d call the book brilliant and original if only I were certain I understood it&#8217; Literary Review</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Superb, brilliant. A compulsive and deeply intelligent literary thriller&#8217; New Statesman</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A neat, up-to-the-minute spy thriller&#8217; Metro</p>
<p>                    William Gibson is a prophet and a satirist, a black comedian and an outstanding architect of cool. Readers of Neal Stephenson, Ray Bradbury and Iain M. Banks will love this book. Spook Country is the second novel in the Blue Ant trilogy &#8211; read Pattern Recognition and Zero History for more.</p>
<p>                    William Gibson&#8217;s first novel Neuromancer sold more than six million copies worldwide. Count Zero and Mona Lisa Overdrive completed his first trilogy. He has since written six further novels, moving gradually away from science fiction and futuristic work, instead writing about the strange contemporary world we inhabit. His most recent novels include Pattern Recognition, Spook Country and Zero History. His non-fiction collection, Distrust That Particular Flavor, compiles assorted writings and journalism from across his career. His most recent novel is The Peripheral.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling spy novel The Company lays bare the history and inner workings of the CIA. This critically acclaimed blockbuster from internationally renowned novelist Robert Littell  seamlessly weaves together history and fiction to create a multigenerational, wickedly nostalgic saga of the CIA-known as &#8220;the Company&#8221; to insiders. Racing across a landscape spanning the legendary Berlin Base of the &#8217;50s, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Bay of Pigs, Afghanistan, and the Gorbachev putsch, The Company tells the thrilling story of agents imprisoned in double lives, fighting an amoral, elusive, formidable enemy-and each other-in an internecine battle within the Company itself. A brilliant, stunningly conceived epic thriller, adapted as a TNT miniseries starring Chris O&#8217;Donnell, Alfred Molina, and Michael Keaton, The Company confirms Littell&#8217;s place among the genre&#8217;s elite.</p>

<p>                    Ben Hartman is on holiday in Switzerland when he meets a childhood friend &#8211; who promptly tries to kill him. In self-defence, Ben kills his attacker, but soon the body and all evidence of the confrontation have disappeared.     </p>

Someone wants this secret kept, and not only are the futures of Hartman and Navarro at stake, but also that of the free world&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twentieth century detective Isaac Bell takes on the world of warfare when America&#8217;s naval research and development experts begin to die one by one in this #1 New York Times-bestselling historical action adventure.    </p>
<p>                     1908 marks a year of ever-escalating international tension as the world plunges toward war. And with America on the brink, it comes as a devastating blow to learn of the apparent suicide of one of the United States&#8217; most brilliant battleship-gun designers. The death becomes a media sensation, and the man&#8217;s grief-stricken daughter turns to the legendary Van Dorn Detective Agency to clear her father&#8217;s name. Van Dorn puts his chief investigator on the case, and Isaac Bell soon sees that the clues point not to suicide, but to murder. As Bell notices more suspicious deaths among the nation&#8217;s sharpest technological minds, he begins to suspect the work of an elusive spy somehow connected to a top-secret project called Hull 44.    </p>
<p>                     But that is just the beginning. As the intrigue deepens, Bell will find himself pitted against German, Japanese, and British spies, in a mission that encompasses dreadnought battleships, Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s Great White Fleet, Chinatown, Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Isaac Bell has certainly faced perilous situations before, but this time it is more than the future of his country that&#8217;s at stake-it&#8217;s the fate of the world.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The most exciting development in spy fiction since the Cold War&#8217; The Times</p>
<p>                    Slough House is the outpost where disgraced spies are banished to see out the rest of their derailed careers. Known as the &#8216;slow horses&#8217; these misfits have committed crimes of drugs and drunkenness, lechery and failure, politics and betrayal while on duty.</p>
<p>                    In this drab and mildewed office these highly trained spies don&#8217;t run ops, they push paper. Not one of them joined the Intelligence Service to be a slow horse and the one thing they have in common is they want to be back in the action.</p>
<p>                    When a boy is kidnapped and held hostage, his beheading is scheduled for live broadcast on the net. And whatever the instructions of their masters at the Intelligence Service headquarters, the slow horses aren&#8217;t going to just sit quiet and watch.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Captivating&#8217; Christopher Brookmyre</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE starring Jennifer Lawrence, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons.    </p>
<p>                     Dominika Egorov, former prima ballerina, is sucked into the heart of Putin&#8217;s Russia, the country she loved, as the twists and turns of a betrayal and counter-betrayal unravel.    </p>
<p>                     American Nate Nash, idealistic and ambitious, handles the double agent, codenamed MARBLE, considered one of CIA&#8217;s biggest assets. He needs to keep his identity secret for as long as the mole can keep supplying golden information.    </p>
<p>                    Will Dominika be able to unmask MARBLE, or will the mission see her faith destroyed in the country she has always passionately defended?    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;A great and dangerous spy-game is being played today between Russian intelligence and the CIA. Very few people know about it, including many of our politicians in Washington. But Jason Matthews does, and his thrilling Red Sparrow takes us deep inside this treacherous world. He&#8217;s an insider&#8217;s insider. He knows the secrets. And he is also a masterful story-teller. I loved this book and could not put it down. Neither will you&#8217; Vince Flynn    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Not since the good old days of the Cold War has a classic spy thriller like Red Sparrow come along. Jason Matthews is not making it up; he has lived this life and this story, and it shows on every page. High-level espionage, pulse-pounding danger, sex, double agents and double crosses. What more can any reader want?&#8217; Nelson DeMille</p>

<p>                    Jason Bourne takes a mission to rescue his only friend in the CIA, Martin Lindros, who disappeared in Africa while tracking shipments of yellowcake uranium.     </p>
<p>                    Once safely back in America, Lindros persuades Bourne to help track the money trail of terrorists buying the nuclear material.

<p>                    Worse still, is the man he saved really Martin Lindros? Now Bourne is on his own &#8211; gathering evidence, while trying to stay one step ahead of the terrorists who are determined to destroy the USA&#8230;    </p>
