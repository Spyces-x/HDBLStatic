										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book is AMAZING!&#8217; &#8211; MALCOLM GLADWELL    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;If you want to gain insight into the mind of great athletes, adventurers, and peak performers then prepare to be enthralled by Alex Hutchinson&#8217;s Endure.&#8217; &#8211; BEAR GRYLLS    </p>
<p>                              How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person&#8217;s limits? From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we&#8217;re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.    </p>
<p>                              In Endure Alex Hutchinson, Ph.D., reveals why our individual limits may be determined as much by our head and heart, as by our muscles. He presents an overview of science&#8217;s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs&#8217; legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits, he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals-whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid-and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.    </p>
<p>                              An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology &#8211; brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging &#8211; and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today, showing us how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance &#8211; and get the most out of their bodies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scientific evidence behind why we should maintain a lifestyle more like that of our ancestors to restore our health and well-being.     </p>
<p>                    In GO WILD, Harvard Medical School professor John Ratey, MD, and journalist Richard Manning reveal that although civilization has rapidly evolved, our bodies stopped changing long ago&#8211;creating a disconnect between how we live and what is best for us. This disconnect affects every area of our lives, from our energy levels to our relationships to our general health. Only by using ancient evolutionary instructions to navigate modern life can we realize our true potential in everything including strength, health and well-being, intelligence, happiness, and more. The book addresses modern diseases (from diabetes to cancer to addiction); the problems of the modern diet; exercise; sleep; mindfulness and relationships; and much more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CrossFit trainer Ben Bergeron has helped build the world&#8217;s fittest athletes, but he&#8217;s not like other coaches. He believes that greatness is not for the elite few; that winning is a result, not a goal; and that character, not talent, is what makes a true champion. His powerful philosophy can help anyone excel at all aspects of life.Using the dramatic competition between the top contenders at the 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games(R) as a background, Ben explores the step-by-step process of achieving excellence and the unique set of positive character traits necessary for leveling up to world-class. The mindset and methodology that have produced some of the greatest athletes in the world&#8217;s most gruelling sport can work equally well for golfers, lawyers, artists, entrepreneurs-anyone who&#8217;s willing to commit totally to becoming better than the best.By Chasing Excellence, you&#8217;ll discover how extraordinary it&#8217;s possible for you to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Paleo Manifesto: Ancient Wisdom for Lifelong Health, John Durant argues for an evolutionary &#8211; and revolutionary &#8211; approach to health. All animals, human or otherwise, thrive when they mimic key elements of life in their natural habitat. From diet to movement to sleep, this evolutionary perspective sheds light on some of our most pressing health concerns. What is causing the rise of chronic conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, and depression? Is eating red meat going to kill you? Is avoiding the sun actually the best way to avoid skin cancer?     </p>
<p>                    Durant takes readers on a thrilling ride to the Paleolithic and beyond, unlocking the health secrets of our ancient ancestors. What do obese gorillas teach us about weight loss? How can Paleolithic skulls contain beautiful sets of teeth? Why is the Bible so obsessed with hygiene? What do NASA astronauts teach us about getting a good night&#8217;s sleep? And how are Silicon Valley techies hacking the human body?     </p>
<p>                    Blending science and culture, anthropology and philosophy, John Durant distills the lessons from his adventures and shows how to apply them to day-to-day life, teaching people how to construct their own personal &#8220;habitat&#8221; that will enable them to thrive. The book doesn&#8217;t just address what we eat, but why we eat it; not just how to exercise, but the purpose of functional movement; not just being healthy, but leading a purposeful life.     </p>
<p>                    Combining the best of ancient wisdom with cutting edge science, Durant crafts a vision of health that is both fresh and futuristic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestseller &#8211; with a new afterword about early specialization in youth sports &#8211; from the author of Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.     </p>
<p>                     The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic freaks put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training?    </p>
<p>                     In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success and the so-called 10,000-hour rule, David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate and traces how far science has come in solving it. Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the very nature of athleticism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe De Sena, one of the founding creators of Spartan Races, sounds the alarm of how soft and weak we&#8217;ve become through modern living. Spartan Up! is a call to arms, motivating readers to take action in their lives through inspiring stories and practical advice.    </p>
<p>                    What do marathoners do when 26.2 miles just isn&#8217;t enough anymore? They try obstacle racing, combining the endurance challenges of a marathon with the mind- and body-bending rigors of overcoming obstacles along the way. At the heart of this phenomenon is Joe De Sena, the driving force behind the Spartan Race.     </p>
<p>                    De Sena overcame his own obstacles&#8211;working his way from Queens to Wall Street to legendary extreme athlete&#8211;by adhering to a simple philosophy: commit to a goal, put in the work, and get it done. From that philosophy, as played out now for millions across trails, through mud, and up mountainsides, the Spartan Race was born.     </p>
<p>                    Filled with unforgettable stories of Spartan racers as well as hard-won truths learned along the course, Spartan Up! will help you reach your full potential in whatever you set out to do.    </p>
<p>                    A must-read for anyone looking to take his performance to the next level, be it in athletics or in life.&#8211;Dean Karnazes, author of Ultra Marathon Man     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;If there&#8217;s anyone out there who has taken extreme to a new level, its Joe De Sena&#8211;in adventure racing, in business, and ultimately in the business of adventure! Spartan Up! is a must-read.&#8221;&#8211;Robyn Benincasa, world champion adventure racer and New York Times best-selling author of How Winning Works</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bestselling author of The Willpower Instinct introduces a surprising science-based book that doesn&#8217;t tell us why we should exercise but instead shows us how to fall in love with movement.    </p>
<p>                    Exercise is health-enhancing and life-extending, yet many of us feel it&#8217;s a chore. But, as Kelly McGonigal reveals, it doesn&#8217;t have to be. Movement can and should be a source of joy.    </p>
<p>                    Through her trademark blend of science and storytelling, McGonigal draws on insights from neuroscience, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology, as well as memoirs, ethnographies, and philosophers. She shows how movement is intertwined with some of the most basic human joys, including self-expression, social connection, and mastery&#8211;and why it is a powerful antidote to the modern epidemics of depression, anxiety, and loneliness.    </p>
<p>                    McGonigal tells the stories of people who have found fulfillment and belonging through running, walking, dancing, swimming, weightlifting, and more, with examples that span the globe, from Tanzania, where one of the last hunter-gatherer tribes on the planet live, to a dance class at Juilliard for people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, to the streets of London, where volunteers combine fitness and community service, to races in the remote wilderness, where athletes push the limits of what a human can endure. Along the way, McGonigal paints a portrait of human nature that highlights our capacity for hope, cooperation, and self-transcendence.    </p>
<p>                    The result is a revolutionary narrative that goes beyond familiar arguments in favor of exercise, to illustrate why movement is integral to both our happiness and our humanity. Readers will learn what they can do in their own lives and communities to harness the power of movement to create happiness, meaning, and connection.</p>
