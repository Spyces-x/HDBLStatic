										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garlic has been used throughout history as a nourishing food and a magical medicine, healing everything from toothaches to dysentery. For much of this past century many dismissed its medicinal qualities as folk remedies more efficiently replaced by modern drugs &#8212; but today garlic is undergoing a renaissance. Not only are more people cooking with garlic, they are also growing it in their backyards. And scientists are studying garlic&#8217;s antibiotic, antifungal, and antiparasitic qualities, as well as its potential for cancer treatment. In Pursuit of Garlic tells Liz Primeau&#8217;s story of her love affair with the divinely odorous bulb and leads us on a tour of garlic&#8217;s role in history, art, medicine, and science. Primeau shares her favorite garlic-centered recipes, visits garlic fairs, discusses the many varieties of garlic &#8212; from Russian Red to German Brown to Kettle River Giant &#8212; and gives invaluable tips for growing your own.</p>
