<p>                    Forget everything you think you know about your body and food, and discover the new science of how the body heals itself. Learn how to identify the strategies and dosages for using food to transform your resilience and health in Eat to Beat Disease.     </p>
<p>                    We have radically underestimated our body&#8217;s power to transform and restore our health. Pioneering physician scientist, Dr. William Li, empowers readers by showing them the evidence behind over 200 health-boosting foods that can starve cancer, reduce your risk of dementia, and beat dozens of avoidable diseases. Eat to Beat Disease isn&#8217;t about what foods to avoid, but rather is a life-changing guide to the hundreds of healing foods to add to your meals that support the body&#8217;s defense systems, including: PlumsCinnamonJasmine teaRed wine and beerBlack BeansSan Marzano tomatoesOlive oilPacific oystersCheeses like Jarlsberg, Camembert and cheddarSourdough bread<br />
                    The book&#8217;s plan shows you how to integrate the foods you already love into any diet or health plan to activate your body&#8217;s health defense systems-Angiogenesis, Regeneration, Microbiome, DNA Protection, and Immunity-to fight cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative autoimmune diseases, and other debilitating conditions.     </p>
<p>                    Both informative and practical, Eat to Beat Disease explains the science of healing and prevention, the strategies for using food to actively transform health, and points the science of wellbeing and disease prevention in an exhilarating new direction.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The ultimate source of happiness is within us.&#8217; DALAI LAMA    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested.&#8217; DESMOND TUTU    </p>
<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medical expert Paul A. Offit, M.D., offers a scathing exposé of the alternative medicine industry, revealing how even though some popular therapies are remarkably helpful due to the placebo response, many of them are ineffective, expensive, and even deadly.    </p>
<p>                    Dr. Offit reveals how alternative medicine&#8211;an unregulated industry under no legal obligation to prove its claims or admit its risks&#8211;can actually be harmful to our health.    </p>
<p>                    Using dramatic real-life stories, Offit separates the sense from the nonsense, showing why any therapy&#8211;alternative or traditional&#8211;should be scrutinized. He also shows how some nontraditional methods can do a great deal of good, in some cases exceeding therapies offered by conventional practitioners.    </p>
<p>                    An outspoken advocate for science-based health advocacy who is not afraid to take on media celebrities who promote alternative practices, Dr. Offit advises, &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as alternative medicine. There&#8217;s only medicine that works and medicine that doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I believe that the discoveries in this book can change our understanding of how we store emotional experiences and in so doing, change our lives. The Emotion Code has already changed many lives around the world, and it is my hope that millions more will be led to use this simple tool to heal themselves and their loved ones.&#8217; &#8211; Tony Robbins    </p>
<p>                    In this newly revised and expanded edition of The Emotion Code, renowned holistic physician and lecturer Dr. Bradley Nelson skilfully lays bare the inner workings of the subconscious mind. He reveals how emotionally-charged events from your past can still be haunting you in the form of &#8216;trapped emotions&#8217; &#8211; emotional energies that literally inhabit your body. These trapped emotions can fester in your life and body, creating pain, malfunction and eventual disease. They can also extract a heavy mental and emotional toll on you, impacting how you think, the choices that you make, and the level of success and abundance you are able to achieve. Perhaps most damaging of all, trapped emotional energies can gather around your heart, cutting off your ability to give and receive love.    </p>
<p>                    The Emotion Code is a powerful and simple way to rid yourself of this unseen baggage. Dr. Nelson&#8217;s method gives you the tools to identify and release the trapped emotions in your life, eliminating your &#8217;emotional baggage&#8217;, and opening your heart and body to the positive energies of the world. Filled with real-world examples from many years of clinical practice, The Emotion Code is a distinct and authoritative work that has become a classic on self-healing.</p>

                    __________________________________________________________________________________    </p>
<p>                    FROM THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE STRESS SOLUTION    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Small changes make a big difference &#8211; we can all benefit from reading this&#8217; &#8211; Jamie Oliver    </p>
<p>                    Everyone has the opportunity to live and feel better and in his Sunday Times bestselling book, The 4 Pillar Plan, BBC One&#8217;s Dr Rangan Chatterjee creates an easily accessible plan for taking control of your health and your life.    </p>
<p>                    Dr Chatterjee believes that everyday health revolves around the following four pillars: relaxation, food, movement and sleep. By making small, achievable changes in each of these key areas you can create and maintain good health &#8211; and avoid illness. Top tips in each area include:     </p>
<p>                    * an electronic &#8216;sabbath&#8217; once a week<br />
                     * 12 hours every day without food<br />
                     * exposure to sunlight first thing each morning<br />
                     * walking at least 10,000 steps a day    </p>
<p>                    Based on cutting edge research and his own two decades&#8217; worth of experience as a doctor, this book contains fascinating case studies from real patients and is an inspiring and easy-to-follow guide to better health and happiness.</p>

<p>                    Alternative therapies, healing modalities, and spiritual practices are often referred to as &#8216;woo-woo,&#8217; &#8211; but many of these approaches are actually supported by compelling scientific evidence.    </p>
<p>                    In this dynamic and thought-provoking book, David R. Hamilton PhD dives deeper into the true nature of consciousness and presents the cutting-edge research behind energy healing, crystals, meditation, and more.    </p>
<p>                    You&#8217;ll discover:<br />
                    *      The science behind some of today&#8217;s most popular alternative practices<br />
                    *      How your thoughts, emotions, and beliefs have healing power<br />
                    *      The benefits of nature and a holistic approach to healing<br />
                    *      A fascinating link between consciousness and human connection<br />
                    *      The relationship between suppressed emotions and disease    </p>
<p>                    The ideas behind some of these holistic therapies have been around for millennia &#8211; but now we have scientific evidence demonstrating how they can contribute to physical, emotional, and energetic healing too.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s time to embrace the truth: That woo-woo really does work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FROM NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR DR. JASON FUNG * &#8220;The doctor who invented intermittent fasting.&#8221;-The Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Dr. Fung reveals how [type 2 diabetes] can be prevented and also reversed using natural dietary methods instead of medications &#8230; This is an important and timely book. Highly recommended.&#8221;-Dr. Mark Hyman, author of The Pegan Diet    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Dr. Jason Fung has done it again. &#8230; Get this book!&#8221;-Dr. Steven R. Gundry, author of The Plant Paradox    </p>
<p>                    Everything you believe about treating type 2 diabetes is wrong. Today, most doctors, dietitians, and even diabetes specialists consider type 2 diabetes to be a chronic and progressive disease-a life sentence with no possibility of parole. But the truth, as Dr. Fung reveals in this groundbreaking book, is that type 2 diabetes is reversible.     </p>
<p>                    Writing with clear, persuasive language, Dr. Fung explains why conventional treatments that rely on insulin or other blood-glucose-lowering drugs can actually exacerbate the problem, leading to significant weight gain and even heart disease. The only way to treat type 2 diabetes effectively, he argues, is proper dieting and intermittent fasting-not medication.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The Diabetes Code is unabashedly provocative yet practical &#8230; a clear blueprint for everyone to take control of their blood sugar, their health, and their lives.&#8221;- Dr. Will Cole, author of Intuitive Fasting</p>
