										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is said that the enemy of my enemy is my friend, but couldn&#8217;t he just be another enemy? Rin and her bodyguard, the immortal swordsman Manji, need to know the answer when they visit the headquarters of the mysterious Akagi assassins &#8211; led by the beautiful and deadly Hyakurin &#8211; who are out for vengeance against the Itto-Ryu, the rogue swordschool of Anotsu Kagehisa, the man responsible for the murder of Rin&#8217;s parents. Can Rin and Manji hold to their own course once they&#8217;ve agreed to join forces with the misfit band of killers?
