										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Raven and Fisher Mystery: Book 3    </p>
<p>                    Edinburgh, 1850. This city will bleed you dry.    </p>
<p>                    Dr Will Raven is a man seldom shocked by human remains, but even he is disturbed by the contents of a package washed up at the Port of Leith. Stranger still, a man Raven has long detested is pleading for his help to escape the hangman.    </p>
<p>                    Back in the townhouse of Dr James Simpson, Sarah Fisher has set her sights on learning to practise medicine. Almost everyone seems intent on dissuading her from this ambition, but when word reaches her that a woman has recently obtained a medical degree despite her gender, Sarah decides to seek her out.    </p>
<p>                    Raven&#8217;s efforts to prove his former adversary&#8217;s innocence are failing and he desperately needs Sarah&#8217;s help. Putting their feelings for one another aside, their investigations take them to both extremes of Edinburgh&#8217;s social divide, where they discover that wealth and status cannot alter a fate written in the blood.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First published in the United States in 1949 and widely condemned as obscene, The Egyptian outsold every other novel published that year, and remains a classic; readers worldwide have testified to its life-changing power. It is a full-bodied re-creation of a largely forgotten era in the world s history: the Egypt of the 14th century B.C.E., when pharaohs and gods contended with the near-collapse of history s greatest empire. This epic tale encompasses the whole of the then-known world, from Babylon to Crete, from Thebes to Jerusalem, while centering around one unforgettable figure: Sinuhe, a man of mysterious origins who rises from the depths of degradation to become personal physician to Pharaoh Akhnaton.<br />

<p>                    Some say that to change the world you must first burn it down. Now that belief will be tested in the crucible of revolution: the Breakers and Burners have seized the levers of power, the smoke of riots has replaced the smog of industry, and all must submit to the wisdom of crowds.</p>
<p>                    With nothing left to lose, Citizen Brock is determined to become a new hero for the new age, while Citizeness Savine must turn her talents from profit to survival before she can claw her way to redemption. Orso will find that when the world is turned upside down, no one is lower than a monarch.  And in the bloody North, Rikke and her fragile Protectorate are running out of allies . . . while Black Calder gathers his forces and plots his vengeance.</p>
<p>                    The banks have fallen, the sun of the Union has been torn down, and in the darkness behind the scenes, the threads of the Weaver&#8217;s ruthless plan are slowly being drawn together . . .</p>
<p>                    Capping off the AGE OF MADNESS trilogy, THE WISDOM OF CROWDS brings the series which is revolutionising fantasy to its stunning conclusion . . .</p>

                    PEACE IS JUST ANOTHER KIND OF BATTLEFIELD . . . </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Nimble, brutal and hilarious&#8217; Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Will leave fans begging for more&#8217; Starburst</p>
<p>                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>                    Unrest worms into every layer of society.</p>
<p>                    The Breakers lurk in the shadows, plotting to free the common man from his shackles, while yesterday&#8217;s heroes nurse grievances and noblemen bicker for their own advantage.</p>
<p>                    The King of the Union struggles to find a safe path through the maze of knives that is politics, only to see his enemies, and his debts, multiply.</p>
<p>                    The old ways are being swept aside, but those who would seize the reins of power will find no alliance, no friendship, and no peace, lasts forever.</p>
<p>                    Second in the AGE OF MADNESS trilogy, THE TROUBLE WITH PEACE is the next instalment of a series which is revolutionising fantasy . . .</p>
<p>                    * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A breakneck- speed fantasy book that brings in all the elements of a political thriller, action romp and reflective memoir. Job well done&#8217; The Sun</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Joe Abercrombie is a master of the genre&#8217; Lev Grossman</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s smart. It&#8217;s witty. This is an absolutely top-notch work of fantasy&#8217; Sci-Fi and Fantasy Reviews</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The Trouble with Peace mauls expectations to serve up a sublime sequel that&#8217;s even better than it&#8217;s showstopper of a predecessor&#8217; Novel Notions</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Effortlessly brilliant&#8217; The Bookbeard&#8217;s Blog</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I had insanely high expectations for the sequel. But The Trouble with Peace met pretty much all of them&#8217; The Fantasy Inn</p>
