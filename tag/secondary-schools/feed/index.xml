										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Godmother of Silicon Valley, legendary teacher, and mother of a Super Family shares her tried-and-tested methods for raising happy, healthy, successful children using Trust, Respect, Independence, Collaboration, and Kindness: TRICK.    </p>
<p>                    Esther Wojcicki&#8211;&#8220;Woj&#8221; to her many friends and admirers&#8211;is famous for three things: teaching a high school class that has changed the lives of thousands of kids, inspiring Silicon Valley legends like Steve Jobs, and raising three daughters who have each become famously successful. What do these three accomplishments have in common? They&#8217;re the result of TRICK, Woj&#8217;s secret to raising successful people: Trust, Respect, Independence, Collaboration, and Kindness.     </p>
<p>                    Simple lessons, but the results are radical. Wojcicki&#8217;s methods are the opposite of helicopter parenting. As we face an epidemic of parental anxiety, Woj is here to say: relax. Talk to infants as if they are adults. Allow teenagers to pick projects that relate to the real world and their own passions, and let them figure out how to complete them. Above all, let your child lead. How to Raise Successful People offers essential lessons for raising, educating, and managing people to their highest potential. Change your parenting, change the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>America has long compared its students to top-performing kids of other nations. But how do the world&#8217;s education superpowers look through the eyes of an American high school student? Author Amanda Ripley follows three teenagers who chose to spend one school year living and learning in Finland, South Korea, and Poland. Through their adventures, Ripley discovers startling truths about how attitudes, parenting, and rigorous teaching have revolutionized these countries&#8217; education results.     </p>
<p>                    In The Smartest Kids in the World, Ripley&#8217;s astonishing new insights reveal that top-performing countries have achieved greatness only in the past several decades; that the kids who live there are learning to think for themselves, partly through failing early and often; and that persistence, hard work, and resilience matter more to our children&#8217;s life chances than self-esteem or sports.     </p>
<p>                    Ripley&#8217;s investigative work seamlessly weaves narrative and research, providing in-depth analysis and gripping details that will keep you turning the pages. Written in a clear and engaging style, The Smartest Kids in the World will enliven public as well as dinner table debates over what makes for brighter and better students.</p>
