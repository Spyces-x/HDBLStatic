										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay&#8217;s dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation&#8217;s favourite children&#8217;s book &#8211; Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling&#8217;s timeless classic, Jim Kay&#8217;s glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.     </p>
<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A perennial bestseller in the wizarding world and one of the most popular books in the Hogwarts School library, Quidditch Through the Ages contains all you will ever need to know about the history, the rules &#8211; and the breaking of the rules &#8211; of the noble sport of Quidditch. Packed with fascinating facts, this definitive guide by the esteemed Quidditch writer Kennilworthy Whisp charts the game&#8217;s history from its early origins in the medieval mists on Queerditch Marsh, through to the modern-day sport loved by so many wizard and Muggle families around the world. With comprehensive coverage of famous Quidditch teams, the commonest fouls, the development of racing brooms, and much more, this is a must-have sporting bible for all Harry Potter fans, Quidditch lovers and players, whether the weekend amateur or the seasoned Chudley Cannons season-ticket holder.     </p>
<p>                    This brand new edition of the most famous sports book in the wizarding world pairs J.K. Rowling&#8217;s original text, with gorgeous jacket art by Jonny Duddle and line illustrations throughout by Tomislav Tomic. A contribution from the sale of each book will go to Comic Relief.</p>
