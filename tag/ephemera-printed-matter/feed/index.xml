										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The stunning new novel from the internationally bestselling author of THE SHADOW OF THE WIND.    </p>
<p>                    In an abandoned mansion at the heart of Barcelona, a young man &#8211; David Martin &#8211; makes his living by writing sensationalist novels under a pseudonym. The survivor of a troubled childhood, he has taken refuge in the world of books, and spends his nights spinning baroque tales about the city&#8217;s underworld. But perhaps his dark imaginings are not as strange as they seem, for in a locked room deep within the house letters hinting at the mysterious death of the previous owner. Like a slow poison, the history of the place seeps into his bones as he struggles with an impossible love.     </p>
<p>                    Then David receives the offer of a lifetime: he is to write a book with the power to change hearts and minds. In return, he will receive a fortune, perhaps more. But as David begins the work, he realises that there is a connection between this haunting book and the shadows that surround his home&#8230;    </p>
