										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his signature larger-than-life style, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Total Recall is a revealing self-portrait of his illustrious, controversial, and truly unique life. </p>
<p>                    The greatest immigrant success story of our time. </p>
<p>                     His story is unique, and uniquely entertaining, and he tells it brilliantly in these pages. </p>
<p>                     He was born in a year of famine, in a small Austrian town, the son of an austere police chief. He dreamed of moving to America to become a bodybuilding champion and a movie star. </p>
<p>                     By the age of twenty-one, he was living in Los Angeles and had been crowned Mr. Universe. </p>
<p>                     Within five years, he had learned English and become the greatest bodybuilder in the world. </p>
<p>                     Within ten years, he had earned his college degree and was a millionaire from his business enterprises in real estate, landscaping, and bodybuilding. He was also the winner of a Golden Globe Award for his debut as a dramatic actor in Stay Hungry. </p>
<p>                     Within twenty years, he was the world&#8217;s biggest movie star, the husband of Maria Shriver, and an emerging Republican leader who was part of the Kennedy family. </p>
<p>                     Thirty-six years after coming to America, the man once known by fellow body-builders as the Austrian Oak was elected governor of California, the seventh largest economy in the world. </p>
<p>                     He led the state through a budget crisis, natural disasters, and political turmoil, working across party lines for a better environment, election reforms, and bipartisan solutions. </p>
<p>                     With Maria Shriver, he raised four fantastic children. In the wake of a scandal he brought upon himself, he tried to keep his family together. </p>
<p>                     Until now, he has never told the full story of his life, in his own voice. </p>
<p>                     Here is Arnold, with total recall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed sports psychologist Bob Rotella has advised everyone from professional golfers to NBA superstars to business executives on how to flourish under pressure and overcome challenges. &#8220;Rotella&#8217;s philosophy is astonishingly simple&#8230;his success rate&#8230;is phenomenal&#8221; (The New York Times). Now, for the first time, he&#8217;s distilled his decades of in-depth research and practical experience into a potential-unlocking guide for everyone, from businesspeople to athletes to parents.<br />
                         Most psychology is focused on trying to make abnormal people normal. Bob Rotella&#8217;s work is to make normal people exceptional. How Champions Think takes readers inside the minds of winners in many fields. It explores how to keep the mind from holding you back, whatever your physical gifts or other talents. It&#8217;s about how to make a commitment, how to persevere, how to deal with failure. It&#8217;s about how to train your mind to create a self-image that promotes confidence and accomplishment.<br />
                         Any successful life starts with how you see yourself. And with these pearls of wisdom from the nation&#8217;s preeminent sports psychologist, you can learn to achieve the success of your dreams. &#8220;Straightforward and simple&#8230;Do the math. Read Rotella&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the World&#8217;s all-time great leaders&#8217;Professor Anita Elberse, Harvard Business SchoolWhat does it take to lead a team to world-class success over a sustained period of time?Sir  Alex Ferguson is one of the few leaders who truly knows. In his 38  years in management, Sir Alex won an astonishing 49 trophies and helped  grow Manchester United into one of the biggest commercial brands in the  world.  In this inspirational and straight-talking book, Sir Alex reveals the secrets behind his record-breaking career.LEADING  is structured around the key skills that Sir Alex values most highly.  It includes subjects we immediately associate with his managerial style:  Discipline, Control, Teamwork and Motivation. But it also addresses  subjects that are less obvious but no less important when seeking  success: Delegation, Data Analysis and Dealing with Failure.Written  with the investor Sir Michael Moritz, a longstanding friend of Sir  Alex, LEADING is packed with insight, wisdom, humour and honesty. The  individual stories inevitably concern themselves with football, and the  phenomenal success that came along the way, but the lessons can be  applied by anyone.<br />
                    Whether you run a business, teach in a classroom, or  work in a small team, LEADING will help you become a better leader.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestseller &#8211; with a new afterword about early specialization in youth sports &#8211; from the author of Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World.     </p>
<p>                     The debate is as old as physical competition. Are stars like Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, and Serena Williams genetic freaks put on Earth to dominate their respective sports? Or are they simply normal people who overcame their biological limits through sheer force of will and obsessive training?    </p>
<p>                     In this controversial and engaging exploration of athletic success and the so-called 10,000-hour rule, David Epstein tackles the great nature vs. nurture debate and traces how far science has come in solving it. Through on-the-ground reporting from below the equator and above the Arctic Circle, revealing conversations with leading scientists and Olympic champions, and interviews with athletes who have rare genetic mutations or physical traits, Epstein forces us to rethink the very nature of athleticism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bold new theory of leadership drawn from elite captains throughout sports&#8211;named one of the best business books of the year by CNBC, The New York Times, Forbes, strategy+business, The Globe and Mail,  and Sports Illustrated     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The book taught me that there&#8217;s no cookie-cutter way to lead. Leading is not just what Hollywood tells you. It&#8217;s not the big pregame speech. It&#8217;s how you carry yourself every day, how you treat the people around you, who you are as a person.&#8221;&#8211;Mitchell Trubisky, quarterback, Chicago Bears    </p>
<p>                    Now featuring analysis of the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots and their captain, Tom Brady     </p>
<p>                    The seventeen most dominant teams in sports history had one thing in common: Each employed the same type of captain&#8211;a singular leader with an unconventional set of skills and tendencies. Drawing on original interviews with athletes, general managers, coaches, and team-building experts, Sam Walker identifies the seven core qualities of the Captain Class&#8211;from extreme doggedness and emotional control to tactical aggression and the courage to stand apart. Told through riveting accounts of pressure-soaked moments in sports history, The Captain Class will challenge your assumptions of what inspired leadership looks like.     </p>
<p>                     Praise for The Captain Class     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Wildly entertaining and thought-provoking . . . makes you reexamine long-held beliefs about leadership and the glue that binds winning teams together.&#8221;&#8211;Theo Epstein, president of baseball operations, Chicago Cubs     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;If you care about leadership, talent development, or the art of competition, you need to read this immediately.&#8221;&#8211;Daniel Coyle, author of The Culture Code     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The insights in this book are tremendous.&#8221;&#8211;Bob Myers, general manager, Golden State Warriors     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An awesome book . . . I find myself relating a lot to its portrayal of the out-of the-norm leader.&#8221;&#8211;Carli Lloyd, co-captain, U.S. Soccer Women&#8217;s National Team     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;A great read . . . Sam Walker used data and a systems approach to reach some original and unconventional conclusions about the kinds of leaders that foster enduring success. Most business and leadership books lapse into clichés. This one is fresh.&#8221;&#8211;Jeff Immelt, chairman and former CEO, General Electric      </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much I loved The Captain Class. It identifies something many people who&#8217;ve been around successful teams have felt but were never able to articulate. It has deeply affected my thoughts around how we build our culture.&#8221;&#8211;Derek Falvey, chief baseball officer, Minnesota Twins</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe De Sena, one of the founding creators of Spartan Races, sounds the alarm of how soft and weak we&#8217;ve become through modern living. Spartan Up! is a call to arms, motivating readers to take action in their lives through inspiring stories and practical advice.    </p>
<p>                    What do marathoners do when 26.2 miles just isn&#8217;t enough anymore? They try obstacle racing, combining the endurance challenges of a marathon with the mind- and body-bending rigors of overcoming obstacles along the way. At the heart of this phenomenon is Joe De Sena, the driving force behind the Spartan Race.     </p>
<p>                    De Sena overcame his own obstacles&#8211;working his way from Queens to Wall Street to legendary extreme athlete&#8211;by adhering to a simple philosophy: commit to a goal, put in the work, and get it done. From that philosophy, as played out now for millions across trails, through mud, and up mountainsides, the Spartan Race was born.     </p>
<p>                    Filled with unforgettable stories of Spartan racers as well as hard-won truths learned along the course, Spartan Up! will help you reach your full potential in whatever you set out to do.    </p>
<p>                    A must-read for anyone looking to take his performance to the next level, be it in athletics or in life.&#8211;Dean Karnazes, author of Ultra Marathon Man     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;If there&#8217;s anyone out there who has taken extreme to a new level, its Joe De Sena&#8211;in adventure racing, in business, and ultimately in the business of adventure! Spartan Up! is a must-read.&#8221;&#8211;Robyn Benincasa, world champion adventure racer and New York Times best-selling author of How Winning Works</p>
