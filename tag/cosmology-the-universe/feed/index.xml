<p>                    &#8216;An utter joy&#8217; (Adam Rutherford)    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A hugely engaging book&#8230; Rovelli is a charming, thought-provoking tour guide&#8217; (Manjit Kumar Prospect)    </p>
<p>                    Do space and time truly exist? What is reality made of? Can we understand its deep texture?<br />
                    Scientist Carlo Rovelli has spent his whole life exploring these questions and pushing the boundaries of what we know. In this mind-expanding book, he shows how our understanding of reality has changed throughout centuries, from Democritus to loop quantum gravity. Taking us on a wondrous journey, he invites us to imagine a whole new world where black holes are waiting to explode, spacetime is made up of grains, and infinity does not exist &#8212; a vast universe still largely undiscovered.    </p>
<p>                    Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Daily Telegraph and TLS Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An audacious tour of all that science can teach us&#8217; Edward O. Wilson    </p>
<p>                    Specialist scientific fields are developing at incredibly swift speeds, but what can they really tell us about how the universe began and how humans evolved to play such a dominant role on Earth? John Hands&#8217;s extraordinarily ambitious quest brings together our scientific knowledge and evaluates the theories and evidence about the origin and evolution of matter, life, consciousness, and humankind.    </p>
<p>                    Cosmosapiens provides the most comprehensive account yet of current ideas such as cosmic inflation, dark energy, the selfish gene, and neurogenetic determinism. In clear and accessible language, Hands differentiates the firmly established from the speculative and examines the claims of various fields such as string theory to approach a unified theory of everything. In doing so he challenges the orthodox consensus in those branches of cosmology, biology, and neuroscience that have ossified into dogma. His striking analysis reveals underlying patterns of cooperation, complexification, and convergence that lead to the unique emergence in humans of a self-reflective consciousness that enables us to determine our future evolution. This groundbreaking book is destined to become a classic of scientific thinking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>RETURNING TO TELEVISION AS AN ALL-NEW MINISERIES ON FOX     </p>
<p>                    Cosmos is one of the bestselling science books of all time. In clear-eyed prose, Sagan reveals a jewel-like blue world inhabited by a life form that is just beginning to discover its own identity and to venture into the vast ocean of space. Featuring a new Introduction by Sagan&#8217;s collaborator, Ann Druyan, full color illustrations, and a new Foreword by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, Cosmos retraces the fourteen billion years of cosmic evolution that have transformed matter into consciousness, exploring such topics as the origin of life, the human brain, Egyptian hieroglyphics, spacecraft missions, the death of the Sun, the evolution of galaxies, and the forces and individuals who helped to shape modern science.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Christian, creator of Big History (&#8216;My favourite course of all time&#8217; Bill Gates), brings us the epic story of the universe and our place in it, from 13.8 billion years ago to the remote future    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Nails home the point: Life is a  miracle &#8230; A compelling history of everything&#8217; Washington Post<br />
                     &#8216;Spectacular&#8217; Carlo Rovelli    </p>
<p>                    How  did we get from the Big Bang to today&#8217;s staggering complexity, in which  seven billion humans are connected into networks powerful enough to  transform the planet? And why, in comparison, are our closest primate  relatives reduced to near-extinction?     </p>
<p>                    Big History creator David  Christian gives the answers in a mind-expanding cosmological detective  story told on the grandest possible scale. He traces how, during eight  key thresholds, the right conditions have allowed new forms of  complexity to arise, from stars to galaxies, Earth to homo sapiens,  agriculture to fossil fuels. This last mega-innovation gave us an energy  bonanza that brought huge benefits to mankind, yet also threatens to  shake apart everything we have created.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Rather like the Big Bang, the book is awe-inspiring &#8230; Superb&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;With   fascinating ideas on every page and the page-turning energy of a good   thriller, this is a landmark work&#8217; Sir Ken Robinson, author of The Element</p>
