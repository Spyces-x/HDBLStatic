										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shashi Tharoor offers a profound re-examination of Hinduism, one of the world&#8217;s oldest and greatest religious traditions.    </p>
<p>                    Opening with a frank and touching reflection on his personal beliefs, he lays out Hinduism&#8217;s origins and its key philosophical concepts &#8211; including Vedanta, the Purusharthas, and Bhakti &#8211; before focusing on texts such as the Bhagadvagita. The &#8216;Great Souls&#8217;, or key individuals of Hinduism, from Adi Shankara to Vivekananda, are discussed, as are everyday Hindu beliefs and practices, from worship to pilgrimage to caste.    </p>
<p>                    Tharoor is unsparing in his criticism of extremism and unequivocal in his belief that what makes India a distinctive nation with a unique culture will be imperilled if Hindu &#8216;fundamentalists&#8217;, the proponents of &#8216;Hindutva&#8217;, or politicised Hinduism, seize the high ground. In his view, it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.    </p>
<p>                    A book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu, written in Tharoor&#8217;s captivating prose, is a revelatory and original contribution to our understanding of religion in the modern era.</p>
