										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Combines the gritty toughmindedness of the best coaches with the gentle-but-insistent inspiration of the most effective spiritual advisers&#8221; (Fast Company).     </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking New York Times bestseller has helped hundreds of thousands of people at work and at home balance stress and recovery and sustain high performance despite crushing workloads and 24/7 demands on their time.      </p>
<p>                    We live in digital time. Our pace is rushed, rapid-fire, and relentless. Facing crushing workloads, we try to cram as much as possible into every day. We&#8217;re wired up, but we&#8217;re melting down. Time management is no longer a viable solution. As bestselling authors Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz demonstrate in this groundbreaking book, managing energy, not time, is the key to enduring high performance as well as to health, happiness, and life balance. The Power of Full Engagement is a highly practical, scientifically based approach to managing your energy more skillfully both on and off the job by laying out the key training principles and provides a powerful, step-by-step program that will help you to:     </p>
<p>                     * Mobilize four key sources of energy<br />
                     * Balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal<br />
                     * Expand capacity in the same systematic way that elite athletes do<br />
                     * Create highly specific, positive energy management rituals to make lasting changes     </p>
<p>                     Above all, this book provides a life-changing road map to becoming more fully engaged on and off the job, meaning physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused, and spiritually aligned.</p>
