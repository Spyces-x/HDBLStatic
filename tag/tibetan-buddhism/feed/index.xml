										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not enough merely to espouse a noble vision, the Dalai Lama tells us &#8211; we need to move toward it. The Dalai Lama&#8217;s vision beckons us all. Every one of us can be a force for good&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama has for decades travelled the world, meeting people from all backgrounds and sharing with them his wisdom and compassion.     </p>
<p>                    In his encounters with everyone, from heads to state to inhabitants of shanty towns, he has come across similar problems: values that help the wealthy to advance beyond the poor, an environmental disregard that could lead to global catastrophe and governments in paralysis, bereft of any positive, progressive policies.    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama offers here his unique vision for a global economic system, one that applies principals of fairness and which values fulfilment, focusing on what is truly urgent and why. It is a manifesto that has the potential to reshape humanity as we know it and bring hope to millions.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The ultimate source of happiness is within us.&#8217; DALAI LAMA    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested.&#8217; DESMOND TUTU    </p>
<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of When Things Fall Apart, an open-hearted call for human connection, compassion, and learning to love the world just as it is during these most challenging times.      </p>
<p>                     In her first new book of spiritual teachings in over seven years, Pema Chödrön offers a combination of wisdom, heartfelt reflections, and the signature mix of humor and insight that have made her a beloved figure to turn to during times of change. In an increasingly polarized world, Pema shows us how to strengthen our abilities to find common ground, even when we disagree, and influence our environment in positive ways. Sharing never-before told personal stories from her remarkable life, simple and powerful everyday practices, and directly relatable advice, Pema encourages us all to become triumphant bodhisattvas&#8211;compassionate beings&#8211;in times of hardship.     </p>
<p>                     Welcoming the Unwelcome includes teachings on the true meaning of karma, recognizing the basic goodness in ourselves and the people we share our lives with&#8211;even the most challenging ones, transforming adversity into opportunities for growth, and freeing ourselves from the empty and illusory labels that separate us. Pema also provides step-by-step guides to a basic sitting meditation and a compassion meditation that anyone can use to bring light to the darkness we face, wherever and whatever it may be.</p>
