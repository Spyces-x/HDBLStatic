										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald J. Trump lays out his professional and personal worldview in this classic work&#8211;a firsthand account of the rise of America&#8217;s foremost deal-maker. </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I like thinking big. I always have. To me it&#8217;s very simple: If you&#8217;re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.&#8221;&#8211;Donald J. Trump </p>
<p>                    Here is Trump in action&#8211;how he runs his organization and how he runs his life&#8211;as he meets the people he needs to meet, chats with family and friends, clashes with enemies, and challenges conventional thinking. But even a maverick plays by rules, and Trump has formulated time-tested guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest accomplishments; he shatters myths; he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker&#8217;s art. And throughout, Trump talks&#8211;really talks&#8211;about how he does it. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur&#8211;the ultimate read for anyone interested in the man behind the spotlight. </p>
<p>                     Praise for Trump: The Art of the Deal </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again.&#8221;&#8211;The New York Times  </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Donald Trump is a deal maker. He is a deal maker the way lions are carnivores and water is wet.&#8221;&#8211;Chicago Tribune</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Fascinating . . . wholly absorbing . . . conveys Trump&#8217;s larger-than-life demeanor so vibrantly that the reader&#8217;s attention is instantly and fully claimed.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Herald</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A chatty, generous, chutzpa-filled autobiography.&#8221;&#8211;New York Post</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</p>
<p>                    An adrenaline-fuelled expose of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio Garcia Martinez, this is Liar&#8217;s Poker meets The Social Network. </p>
<p>                    Computer engineers use &#8216;chaos monkey&#8217; software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio Garcia Martinez are society&#8217;s chaos monkeys &#8211; their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) &#8211; all in search of the perfect business miracle.  </p>
<p>                    Describing himself as &#8216;high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times&#8217;, Garcia Martinez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook&#8217;s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users&#8217; data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark &#8216;Zuck&#8217; Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, Garcia Martinez  took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg&#8217;s desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.</p>
<p>                    In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW &#8211; and HOW NOT &#8211; to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing.  Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, Garcia Martinez  unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital &#8216;privacy&#8217;, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Thank You Economy isn&#8217;t some abstract concept or wacky business strategy. It&#8217;s the way we buy and sell, the way we&#8217;re interacting as consumers, as employees, as entrepreneurs on all levels, right now. The way our marketplace functions has been evolving right before our eyes. Top-down, one-way exchanges are gone, replaced by relationships based on open, honest, and constant communication between customers and business. Today, individuals and brands that out-care and out-love their competition &#8211; those emphasising quality, value, responsiveness, and attention to detail, among other essentials &#8211; see the biggest returns. Gary Vaynerchuk contends that the people and companies harnessing the word-of-mouth power provided by multiplatform media &#8211; those that can shift their outlook and operations to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly &#8211; will pull away from the pack and profit in today&#8217;s markets. In &#8220;The Thank You Economy&#8221;, he dissects the companies on the leading edge, showing how they are succeeding &#8211; and sometimes failing.<br />
                    Laying out the ideas and insight that support this enormous change, Vaynerchuk explores these emerging connections &#8211; from consumer to consumer and business to business and everything in between. Passionate and persuasive, he reminds us that, surviving and thriving today it takes more than just hard work-it takes a heartfelt thanks to those who make it possible.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you have a hobby you wish you could do all day? An obsession that keeps you up at night? Now is the perfect time to take those passions and make a living doing what you love. In Crush It! Why Now Is The Time To Cash In On Your Passion, Gary Vaynerchuk shows you how to use the power of the Internet to turn your real interests into real businesses. Gary spent years building his family business from a local wine shop into a national industry leader. Then one day he turned on a video camera, and by using the secrets revealed in this book, transformed his entire life and earning potential by building his personal brand. By the end of this book, any reader will have learned how to harness the power of the Internet to make their entrepreneurial dreams come true. Step by step, Crush It! is the ultimate driver&#8217;s manual for modern business. Gary Vaynerchuk has captured attention with his pioneering, multi-faceted approach to personal branding and business.<br />
                    After primarily utilizing traditional advertising techniques to build his family&#8217;s local retail wine business into a national industry leader, Gary rapidly leveraged social media tools such as Twitter and Facebook to promote Wine Library TV. Gary has always had an early-to-market approach, launching Wine Library&#8217;s retail website in 1997 and Wine Library TV in February of 2006. His lessons on social media, passion, transparency, and reactionary business are not to be missed!    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Business Execution for RESULTS &#8211; A practical guide for leaders of small to mid-sized firms&#8221; written by Stephen Lynch, was named Judges&#8217; Choice Winner in the Management category of the 2014 Small Business Book Awards. The Small Business Book Awards celebrate the best business books that appeal to entrepreneurs, small business owners, CEOs, managers and their employees. The Winners were chosen by an expert panel of 24 judges from the small business community in the USA. The criteria for judging the Winners included: quality and quantity of the content conveyed; usefulness to small business owners and entrepreneurs; and freshness of the subject matter or how it was treated. The level of fan support for each nominee was also taken into account by the judges when choosing the Winners. Ready for Better Business RESULTS? In Business Execution for RESULTS, his practical guide for small to mid-sized companies, Stephen Lynch takes you through the proven strategic planning and business execution processes you need to drive better business RESULTS. This is not just theory. Stephen works in the trenches.

In his book, he shares the methods the RESULTS.com team uses to grow its global software and consulting business, as well as the businesses of its client firms. Business Execution for RESULTS sets out a framework that utilizes best-of-breed concepts and tools. It&#8217;s a process that thousands of RESULTS.com clients in all types of fields and industries around the world use to get RESULTS.

They&#8217;re usually surprised when he says he&#8217;s not going to do that. Stephen won&#8217;t tell you what to do, but he&#8217;ll take you, step by step, through a proven framework and share resources you can apply now to get the RESULTS you want. The process works.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A worthy successor to Michael Porter, Bova&#8217;s book is that rare gift: it opens doors for new ideas and new actions. No glib answers here, simply hard-won wisdom that will provoke big changes for organizations large and small.&#8217; &#8211; Seth Godin, author of Linchpin    </p>
<p>                    The Wall Street Journal Top Ten Bestseller: The 10 strategies to sustainable growth, based on a purpose-led culture for organizations large and small.    </p>
<p>                    Tiffani Bova, the Growth and Innovation Evangelist at Salesforce, draws on her expertise as a consultant and practitioner to devise a new framework for business leaders looking to pursue growth. We&#8217;re witnessing an age of endless customization, and growth strategy is no exception. There&#8217;s no one size fits all strategy; a winning strategy for one business may spell doom for another.    </p>
<p>                    In Growth IQ, Bova determines that there are ten simple &#8211; but easily misunderstood &#8211; growth paths, and explains how companies can get a handle on their particular business context, and use it to determine the right combination and sequence of growth paths to take them into the future.     </p>
<p>                    Bova breaks down the strategies deployed by a wide range of companies to show you how:    </p>
<p>                      *  GE and John Deere have lasted over a century and continue to thrive by combining their strategy of innovative product development with a renewed focus on R&#038;D and customer experience.<br />
                      *  Marvel transformed from a struggling comic book publisher to a global entertainment behemoth by realigning their market penetration strategy to focus on comic book characters, instead of just comic books.<br />
                      *  Gateway&#8217;s attempt at market expansion into brick-and-mortar retail led to its failure, while the same move by Apple has accelerated its growth.    </p>
<p>                    Whether your company is on a growth spurt, in a worrying stall, or showing signs of decline, Growth IQ is your map to charting the course of your company&#8217;s future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the socially conscious, the intellectually curious, or the creative soul comes an inspiring, New York Times bestselling handbook for success in business, life, and the all-important task of building a more compassionate world&#8211;by the visionary founder and CEO of KIND Healthy Snacks.    </p>
<p>                     When Daniel Lubetzky started KIND Healthy Snacks in 2004, he aimed to defy the conventional wisdom that snack bars could never be both tasty and healthy, convenient and wholesome. A decade later, the transformative power of the company&#8217;s &#8220;AND&#8221; philosophy has resulted in an astonishing record of achievement. KIND has become the fastest-growing purveyor of healthy snacks in the country. Meanwhile, the KIND Movement&#8211;the company&#8217;s social mission to make the world a little kinder&#8211;has sparked more than a million good deeds worldwide.  In Do the KIND Thing,  Lubetzky shares the revolutionary principles that have shaped KIND&#8217;s business model and led to its success, while offering an unfiltered and intensely personal look into the mind of a pioneering social entrepreneur. Inspired by his father, who survived the Holocaust thanks to the courageous kindness of strangers, Lubetzky began his career handselling a sun-dried tomato spread made collaboratively by Arabs and Jews in the war-torn Middle East. Despite early setbacks, he never lost his faith in his vision of a &#8220;not-only-for-profit&#8221; business&#8211;one that sold great products and helped to make the world a better place.  While other companies let circumstances force them into choosing between two seemingly incompatible options, people at KIND say &#8220;AND.&#8221; At its core, this idea is about challenging assumptions and false compromises. It is about not settling for less and being willing to take greater risks, often financial. It is about learning to think boundlessly and critically, and choosing what at first may be the tougher path for later, greater rewards. By using illuminating anecdotes from his own career, and celebrating some past failures through the lessons learned from them, Lubetzky outlines his core tenets for building a successful business and a thriving social enterprise. He explores the value of staying true to your brand, highlights the importance of transparency and communication in the workplace, and explains why good intentions alone won&#8217;t sell products.  Engaging and inspirational, Do the KIND Thing shows how the power of AND worked wonders for one company&#8211;and could empower the next generation of social entrepreneurs to improve their bottom line and change the world. Advance praise for Do the KIND Thing  &#8220;An enjoyable read . . . wise advice about matters from product development to people management.&#8221;&#8211;Financial Times &#8220;By sharing the ten tenets that helped KIND grow, Daniel Lubetzky has given entrepreneurs a road map to success that includes both passion and purpose.&#8221;&#8211;Arianna Huffington, president and editor in chief, Huffington Post Media Group  &#8220;Lubetzky uses the power of kindness to build purpose into his business and his community. He&#8217;s a role model for future leaders.&#8221;&#8211;Mehmet Oz, M.D., professor of surgery, Columbia University  &#8220;I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the KIND brand. This engaging and inspirational book shows how coupling a social mission with creativity can spark change and empower a generation.&#8221;&#8211;Bobbi Brown, founder and CCO, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics</p>

<p>                    With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who&#8217;s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs who want to get out, and artists who don&#8217;t want to starve anymore will all find valuable inspiration and guidance in these pages.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s time to rework work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Help take your startup to the next step with the new and revised edition of the popular book on the VC deal process-from the co-founders of the Foundry Group    </p>
<p>                     How do venture capital deals come together? This is one of the most frequent questions asked by each generation of new entrepreneurs. Surprisingly, there is little reliable information on the subject. No one understands this better than Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Goins, a brilliant new voice counting Seth Godin and Jon Acuff among his fans, explains how to abandon the status quo and live a life that matters with true passion and purpose.    </p>
<p>                    The path to your life&#8217;s work is difficult and risky, even scary, which is why few finish the journey. This is a book about discovering your life&#8217;s work, that treasure of immeasurable worth we all long for. It&#8217;s about the task you were born to do.         </p>
<p>                    As Jeff Goins explains, the search begins with passion but does not end there. Only when our interests connect with the needs of the world do we begin living for a larger purpose. Those who experience this intersection experience something exceptional and enviable. Though it is rare, such a life is attainable by anyone brave enough to try.     </p>
<p>                    Through personal experience, compelling case studies, and current research on the mysteries of motivation and talent, Jeff shows readers how to find their vocation and what to expect along the way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jonathan Fields knows the risks-and potential power-of uncertainty. He gave up a six-figure income as a lawyer to make $12 an hour as a personal trainer. Then, married with a 3-month old baby, he signed a lease to launch a yoga center in the heart of New York City. . . the day before 9/11. But he survived, and along the way he developed a fresh approach to transforming uncertainty, risk of loss, and exposure to judgment into catalysts for innovation, creation, and achievement. In business, art, and life, creating on a world-class level demands bold action and leaps of faith in the face of great uncertainty. But that uncertainty can lead to fear, anxiety, paralysis, and destruction. It can gut creativity and stifle innovation. It can keep you from taking the risks necessary to do great work and craft a deeply-rewarding life. And it can bring companies that rely on innovation grinding to a halt. That is, unless you know how to use it to your advantage. Fields draws on leading-edge technology, cognitive science, and ancient awareness-focusing techniques in a fresh, practical, nondogmatic way. His approach enables creativity and productivity on an entirely different level and can turn the once-tortuous journey into a more enjoyable quest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nail It Then Scale It is the first lean startup book to help entrepreneurs through the process of launching a high-growth company. The book includes not just high-level principles, but a distilled, step by step guide of key actions successful entrepreneurs take to reduce risk and increase success. NISI answers key questions including: Why do most new businesses fail? What first steps do successful serial entrepreneurs take? What are the most common failure traps and how can I avoid them? Based on years of research and observation, Furr and Ahlstrom conclude that startups often fail by doing the &#8220;right things,&#8221; but doing them out of order. In other words, human nature combined with entrepreneurial drive puts the entrepreneur on autopilot to become part of the 70% to 90% of ventures that fail. From Thomas Edison to Steve Jobs, the Nail It Then Scale It method is based on pattern recognition of the timeless principles and key practices used by successful entrepreneurs to repeatedly innovate. These processes and principles have now been distilled into a handbook to guide entrepreneurs step by step to victory. Stop following conventional wisdom and join the few entrepreneurs that consistently take their innovative ideas all the way to a successful product and company launch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scaling up excellence is the key to creating a great organisation. It&#8217;s how a small enterprise expands without losing focus. It&#8217;s how a brilliant new idea or plan developed by the few goes on to be adopted by the many. And, in hard times and tough situations, it&#8217;s how pockets of smart new thinking overcome cultures of indifference  or negativity. An organisation that doesn&#8217;t know how to scale up what is best within it won&#8217;t achieve long-term success.     </p>
<p>                    Bestselling author Robert Sutton and his Stanford colleague Huggy Rao have devoted nearly a decade to uncovering what it takes to create and spread outstanding performance, and in Scaling Up Excellence they share the fruits of their research. Drawing on case studies that range from Silicon Valley enterprises to non-profit organisations, they provide crucial insights into corporate cultures, both good and bad, and offer a road map for establishing and stimulating excellence. In the process, they show how to use &#8216;premortems&#8217; when making big decisions about change. They reveal why seven is so often the magic number when it comes to team size. They examine successful and unsuccessful quests for improvement &#8211; in hospitals, schools and elsewhere. And they discuss when a single corporate mindset is best (&#8216;Catholicism&#8217;) and when local variation is preferable (&#8216;Buddhism&#8217;).     </p>
<p>                    Scaling Up Excellence is the first management book devoted to what is  &#8211; or should be  &#8211;  a core priority for every organisation. As such it is destined to become the standard bearer.</p>

<p>                     Value Proposition Design helps you tackle the core challenge of every business &#8211; creating compelling products and services customers want to buy. This highly practical book, paired with its online companion, will teach you the processes and tools you need to create products that sell.    </p>
<p>                    Using the same stunning visual format as the authors&#8217; global bestseller, Business Model Generation, this sequel explains how to use the &#8220;Value Proposition Canvas&#8221; to design, test, create, and manage products and services customers actually want.    </p>
<p>                    Value Proposition Design is for anyone who has been frustrated by new product meetings based on hunches and intuitions; it&#8217;s for anyone who has watched an expensive new product launch fail in the market. The book will help you understand the patterns of great value propositions, get closer to customers, and avoid wasting time with ideas that won&#8217;t work. You&#8217;ll learn the simple process of designing and testing value propositions, that perfectly match customers&#8217; needs and desires.    </p>
<p>                    In addition the book gives you exclusive access to an online companion on Strategyzer.com. You will be able to assess your work, learn from peers, and download pdfs, checklists, and more.    </p>
<p>                    Value Proposition Design is an essential companion to the &#8220;Business Model Canvas&#8221; from Business Model Generation, a tool embraced globally by startups and large corporations such as MasterCard, 3M, Coca Cola, GE, Fujitsu, LEGO, Colgate-Palmolive, and many more.<br />
                    Value Proposition Design gives you a proven methodology for success, with value propositions that sell, embedded in profitable business models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don&#8217;t need to be university educated, have money, be creative, or even have an idea to get rich. You just need to be willing to break the rules.    </p>
<p>                    How to be a Capitalist Without Any Capital will teach you how to be a modern opportunist &#8211; investor, entrepreneur, or side hustler &#8211; by breaking these four golden rules of the old guard:     </p>
<p>                    1. Focus on one skill: Wrong. Don&#8217;t cultivate one great skill to get ahead. In today&#8217;s business world, success goes to the multitaskers.    </p>
<p>                    2. Be unique: Wrong. The way to get rich is not by launching a new idea but by aggressively copying others and then adding your own twist.     </p>
<p>                    3. Focus on one goal: Wrong. Focus instead on creating a system to produce the outcome you want, not just once, but over and over again.     </p>
<p>                    4. Appeal to the masses: Wrong. The masses are broke ($4k average net worth in America?). Let others cut a trail through the jungle so you can peacefully walk in and capitalize on their hard work.    </p>
<p>                    By rejecting these defunct rules and following Nathan Latka&#8217;s unconventional path, you can copy other people&#8217;s ideas shamelessly, bootstrap a start-up with almost no funding, invest in small local businesses for huge payoffs, and reap all the benefits.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Four-time New York Times bestselling author Gary Vaynerchuk offers new lessons and inspiration drawn from the experiences of dozens of influencers and entrepreneurs who rejected the predictable corporate path in favor of pursuing their dreams by building thriving businesses and extraordinary personal brands.    </p>

He also shares stories from other entrepreneurs who have grown wealthier—and not just financially—than they ever imagined possible by following Crush It principles.

He offers both theoretical and tactical advice on how to become the biggest thing on old standbys like Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat; podcast platforms like Spotify, Soundcloud, iHeartRadio, and iTunes; and other emerging platforms such as Musical.ly.

<p>                    This ground-breaking book exposes the myths behind startup success, illuminates the real forces at work and shows how they can be harnessed in your favour.    </p>
<p>                    The world isn&#8217;t a level playing field. Meritocracy is a myth. And if you look at those at the top, you realise that behind every success story is an Unfair Advantage. But that doesn&#8217;t just mean your parents&#8217; wealth or who you know. An Unfair Advantage is any element that gives you an edge over your competition. And we all have one.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on over two decades of hands-on experience, including as the first Marketing Director of Just Eat (a startup now worth over GBP5 billion), the authors show how to identify your own unfair advantages and apply them to any project. Hard work and grit aren&#8217;t enough, so they explore the importance of money, intelligence, insight, location, education, expertise, status and luck in the journey to success. From Snapchat to Spanx, Oprah to Elon Musk, unfair advantages have shaped the journeys of some of the most successful brands in the world. This book helps you too find the external circumstances and internal strengths to succeed in the world of business and beyond.</p>

<p>                     Are you constantly chasing customers? Why does it seem like some businesses have their customers begging to purchase their goods or services? Think about it for a moment. When a new iPhone is released, why do customers camp overnight to be the first through the door? In cities with thousands of great restaurants, why do some restaurants require reservations months in advance? Why is it that some consultants, accountants, lawyers and healthcare professionals can charge exponentially more than others? In the modern marketplace, consumer options are virtually endless, intense competition is rife and so much is given away for free online.  Often businesses are left scrambling to attract enough customers to make a small profit. Yet the opposite is true for a small number of businesses that do things differently-customers chase them. They have buyers who gladly queue up, pay more, and eagerly wait for the chance to hand over their money for the next thing. How do these businesses do it? More importantly, how can you become one of them?     </p>
<p>                     Oversubscribed is the guide to transforming your business into one which customers fight over!

Now in its second edition, this updated version offers new insights and motivating examples that are right for the 2020s. This book will show you:    </p>
<p>                    The principles and philosophies Oversubscribed businesses live by that are often the opposite of what most businesses do<br />
                    Specific steps for getting into the mind of your customer so they only want to buy from your business<br />
                    How to structure campaigns and product launches that systematically get your business Oversubscribed<br />
                    How to implement a process of signalling to market, and collect signals back from market to build up desire and demand for your products and services    </p>
<p>                     The new edition of Oversubscribed: How to get people lining up to do business with you is a must-read for entrepreneurs, marketers, business leaders and owners, team managers, and business students.</p>

<p>                    PRAISE FOR EPIC CONTENT MARKETING&#8221;From the man who invented content marketing. Listen to this guy. He really understands the new world of marketing. The concepts in Epic Content Marketing are usable all over the world&#8211;instantly usable and useful for any business.&#8221; &#8212; Don Schultz, the &#8220;father of integrated marketing,&#8221; Professor Emeritus at Northwestern University&#8217;s Medill School of Journalism, and author of 13 books    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Joe Pulizzi&#8217;s ideas are so consistently . . . well, epic (!) that they really don&#8217;t need any endorsement by anyone.

If you truly want to be successful at content marketing, Pulizzi is one of the few who can show you the way.&#8221; &#8212; Mitch Joel, President, Twist Image, and author of Six Pixels of Separation and CTRL ALT Delete    </p>

<p>                    &#8220;The future of successful brand building, and especially the art of solidifying the emotional connection between people and brands, will require expertise in Content Marketing.

<p>                     David Cohen and Brad Feld, leading advocates for entrepreneurs and startups, team up to provide first-time entrepreneurs with the tools, insights, and experiences to help them do more faster. The authors share their decades of experience working with thousands of startup founders and have enlisted the advice of dozens of Techstars startup founders and mentors. Contributors include Tim Ferriss, Eric Ries, Matt Mullenweg (WordPress), Isaac Saldana (SendGrid), and other successful entrepreneurs.    </p>
<p>                     Co-founders of Techstars, the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed, Cohen and Feld recognize the daunting task of creating a sustainable business and have seen first-hand the common mistakes first-time entrepreneurs make over and over. The authors take the complexity and uncertainty of starting a business and distill the critical factors into seven themes: Ideas and Vision, People, Working Effectively, Product, Fundraising, Legal and Structure, and Work and Life Harmony. They share their hard-won successes, failures, and advice for anyone with an idea who wants to create a business.    </p>
<p>                     Throughout the book crucial questions are raised and addressed from multiple perspectives.    </p>
<p>                            How important is it to have an original idea?    </p>
<p>                            How is founder conflict handled?    </p>
<p>                            What are the tradeoffs between bootstrapping and financing?    </p>
<p>                     Make-or-break decisions like company structure, hiring, and legal consequences are presented in an easy-to-understand style. Do More Faster will elevate your thinking on a range of important topics, help you avoid costly mistakes, and provide you with a resource to consult as you go from idea to successful business.    </p>
<p>                     If you have the drive and desire to start a business, need to create a vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem in your community, or want to spark greater innovation in your organization-don&#8217;t go it alone. Use the advice, tips, and tactics found throughout Do More Faster to give yourself the best chance of succeeding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times bestselling author, a provocative book of hard-won wisdom for achieving a  fulfilling career and life.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; How can you have a meaningful career, not just a lucrative one?<br />
                    &#8211; Is a work/life balance really possible?<br />
                    &#8211; What does it take to make a long-term relationship succeed?<br />
                    &#8211; What can you do now so there are no regrets aged 40, 50 or 80?    </p>
<p>                                   As Scott Galloway puts it, by the time you hit your mid twenties sh*t gets real. Life become stressful. Even the smart, the hard working and the elite can feel lost in a chaotic, noisy and unpredictable world. As a professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, the debate in Galloway&#8217;s MBA class often veers away from business strategy to the challenging issue of life strategies. Which is why Galloway, in his signature, take-no-prisoners style, has developed a dynamic formula for a life well lived.    </p>
<p>                     In The Algebra of Happiness Galloway tells you how life can be navigated and negotiated better to maximise happiness and minimise the inevitable stress. Delivering practical advice and hard-won wisdom on everything from when to own property to how hard to work, this is self-help for anyone struggling with life&#8217;s big questions. Through simple equations that measure the relationship between success, resilience and failure or the correlation between happiness and money, Galloway attempts to convert intangible advice to tangible equations.</p>

<p>                    In business, performance is key. In performance, how you organize can be the key to growth.    </p>
<p>                    In the past five years, the business world has seen the birth of a new breed of company-the Exponential Organization-that has revolutionized how a company can accelerate its growth by using technology. An ExO can eliminate the incremental, linear way traditional companies get bigger, leveraging assets like community, big data, algorithms, and new technology into achieving performance benchmarks ten times better than its peers.    </p>
<p>                    Three luminaries of the business world-Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike Malone-have researched this phenomenon and documented ten characteristics of Exponential Organizations. Here, in EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS, they walk the reader through how any company, from a startup to a multi-national, can become an ExO, streamline its performance, and grow to the next level.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now available in paperback-with a new preface and interview with Jessica Livingston about Y Combinator!    </p>
<p>                     Founders at Work: Stories of Startups&#8217; Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.    </p>
<p>                     Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?    </p>
<p>                     Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it&#8217;s done.    </p>
<p>                     But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do-create value-more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day &#8212; as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?     </p>
<p>                    Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this book! If you want a true manifesto, a guidebook with clear signposts, and a fun ride you&#8217;ll return to again and again, you have it here in this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did&#8217; Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Workweek      </p>
<p>                    The iconic manifesto on lessons learned while becoming an entrepreneur    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;    </p>
<p>                    You don&#8217;t need a visionary master plan, loads of funding or a brilliant team to start a business.    </p>
<p>                    When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn&#8217;t planning on building a major business. He was a successful independent musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. He started in 1998 by helping his friends sell their CDs too. In 2000, he hired his first employee. Eight years later, he sold CD Baby for $22 million.    </p>
<p>                    Sivers didn&#8217;t need a business plan and neither do you. You don&#8217;t need to think big; in fact, it&#8217;s better if you don&#8217;t. Anything You Want will inspire you to start with what you have, care about your customers more than yourself, and run your business like you don&#8217;t need the money.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Some of the best hours you&#8217;ll ever spend will be reading Derek Sivers&#8217;s new book&#8230;Anything You Want&#8217; Forbes</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Serial entrepreneurs David Kidder and Christina Wallace reveal their revolutionary playbook for igniting growth inside established companies.     </p>
<p>                    Most established companies face a key survival challenge, says David Kidder, CEO of Bionic, lifelong entrepreneur, and angel investor in more than thirty startups: operational efficiency and outdated bureaucracy are at war with new growth. Legacy companies are skilled at growing big businesses into even bigger ones. But they are less adept at discovering new opportunities and turning them into big businesses, the way entrepreneurs and early-stage investors must. In New to Big, Kidder and Wallace reveal their proprietary blueprint for installing a permanent growth capability inside any company&#8211;the Growth Operating System.     </p>
<p>                    The Growth OS borrows the best tools, systems, and mind-sets from entrepreneurship and venture capital and adapts them for established organizations, leveraging these two distinct skills as a form of management for building in a future that is uncertain. By focusing on what consumers do rather than what they say, celebrating productive failure, embracing a portfolio approach, and learning from the outside-in, Kidder and Wallace argue any company can go on offense and win the future.     </p>
<p>                    This isn&#8217;t about a one-off innovation moonshot. It&#8217;s about building a permanent ladder to the moon.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE BRAND GAP is the first book to present a unified theory of brand-building.  Whereas most books on branding are weighted toward either a strategic or creative approach, this book shows how both ways of thinking can unite to produce a &#8220;charismatic brand&#8221;-a brand that customers feel is essential to their lives. In an entertaining two-hour read you&#8217;ll learn:     </p>
<p>                    * the new definition of brand<br />
                    * the five essential disciplines of brand-building<br />
                    * how branding is changing the dynamics of competition<br />
                    * the three most powerful questions to ask about any brand<br />
                    * why collaboration is the key to brand-building<br />
                    * how design determines a customer&#8217;s experience<br />
                    * how to test brand concepts quickly and cheaply<br />
                    * the importance of managing brands from the inside<br />
                    * 220-word brand glossary     </p>
<p>                    From the back cover:<br />
                    Not since McLuhan&#8217;s THE MEDIUM IS THE MESSAGE has a book compressed so many ideas into so few pages. Using the visual language of the boardroom, Neumeier presents the first unified theory of branding-a set of five disciplines to help companies bridge the gap between brand strategy and customer experience. Those with a grasp of branding will be inspired by the new perspectives they find here, and those who would like to understand it better will suddenly &#8220;get it.&#8221; This deceptively simple book offers everyone in the company access to &#8220;the most powerful business tool since the spreadsheet.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve been so wowed by a new author&#8221;<br />
                    -Chip Health, co-author of The Power of Moments and Switch A talented journalist reveals the hidden patterns behind what we call &#8220;luck&#8221; &#8212; and shows us how we can all improve outcomes despite life&#8217;s inevitable randomness. &#8220;Do you believe in luck?&#8221; is a polarizing question, one you might ask on a first date. Some of us believe that we make our own luck. Others see inequality everywhere and think that everyone&#8217;s fate is at the whim of the cosmos. Karla Starr has a third answer: unlucky, &#8220;random&#8221; outcomes have predictable effects on our behavior that often make us act in self-defeating ways without even realizing it.  In this groundbreaking book, Starr traces wealth, health, and happiness back to subconscious neurological processes, blind cultural assumptions, and tiny details you&#8217;re in the habit of overlooking. Each chapter reveals how we can cultivate personal strengths to overcome life&#8217;s unlucky patterns. For instance: &#8211; Everyone has free access to that magic productivity app&#8211;motivation. The problem? It isn&#8217;t evenly distributed. What lucky accidents of history explain patterns behind why certain groups of people are more motivated in some situations than others? &#8211; If you look like an underperforming employee, your resume can&#8217;t override the gut-level assumptions that a potential boss will make from your LinkedIn photo. How can we make sure that someone&#8217;s first impression is favorable? &#8211; Just as people use irrelevant traits to make assumptions about your intelligence, kindness, and trustworthiness, we also make inaccurate snap judgments. How do these judgments affect our interactions, and what should we assume about others to maximize our odds of having lucky encounters?  We don&#8217;t always realize when the world&#8217;s invisible biases work to our advantage or recognize how much of a role we play in our own lack of luck. By ending the guessing game about how luck works, Starr allows you to improve your fortunes while expending minimal effort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The essential playbook for the future of your business What To Do When Machines Do Everything is a guidebook to succeeding in the next generation of the digital economy. When systems running on Artificial Intelligence can drive our cars, diagnose medical patients, and manage our finances more effectively than humans it raises profound questions on the future of work and how companies compete. Illustrated with real-world cases, data, and insight, the authors provide clear strategic guidance and actionable steps to help you and your organization move ahead in a world where exponentially developing new technologies are changing how value is created. Written by a team of business and technology expert practitioners who also authored Code Halos: How the Digital Lives of People, Things, and Organizations are Changing the Rules of Business this book provides a clear path to the future of your work. The first part of the book examines the once in a generation upheaval most every organization will soon face as systems of intelligence go mainstream.<br />
                    The authors argue that contrary to the doom and gloom that surrounds much of IT and business at the moment, we are in fact on the cusp of the biggest wave of opportunity creation since the Industrial Revolution. Next, the authors detail a clear-cut business model to help leaders take part in this coming boom; the AHEAD model outlines five strategic initiatives Automate, Halos, Enhance, Abundance, and Discovery that are central to competing in the next phase of global business by driving new levels of efficiency, customer intimacy and innovation. Business leaders today have two options: be swallowed up by the ongoing technological evolution, or ride the crest of the wave to new profits and better business. This book shows you how to avoid your own extinction event, and will help you; * Understand the untold full extent of technology&#8217;s impact on the way we work and live.<br />
                    * Find out where we&#8217;re headed, and how soon the future will arrive * Leverage the new emerging paradigm into a sustainable business advantage * Adopt a strategic model for winning in the new economy The digital world is already transforming how we work, live, and shop, how we are governed and entertained, and how we manage our money, health, security, and relationships. Don&#8217;t let your business or your career get left behind. What To Do When Machines Do Everything is your strategic roadmap to a future full of possibility and success. Or peril.</p>

<p>                    Traction will teach you the nineteen channels you can use to build a customer base, and offers a three-step framework to figure out which ones will work best for your business. No matter how you apply them, the lessons and examples in Traction will help you create and sustain the growth your business desperately needs.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In September 2012, a YOUGOV poll conducted in Britain found that the person British workers would most like as their manager was Sir Richard Branson.    </p>
<p>                    With over 40 years in business, Richard Branson is an inspiring pioneer of humanitarian projects and an iconic business leader. In The Virgin Way: How to Listen, Learn, Laugh and Lead, Richard shares and distils his secrets of leadership and success. Featuring anecdotes from his own business dealings, as well as his observations of many others who have inspired him &#8211; from politicians, business leaders, explorers, scientists and philanthropists &#8211; Richard reflects on the qualities he feels are essential for success in today&#8217;s world.    </p>
<p>                    This is not a conventional book on leadership. There are no rules &#8211; but rather the secrets of leadership that he has learned along the way from his days at Virgin Records, to his recent work with The Elders. Whether you&#8217;re at the beginning of your career, or head of a Fortune 500 company &#8211; this is your guide to being your own CEO (Chief Enabling Officer) and becoming a true leader &#8211; not just a boss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author and social media expert Gary Vaynerchuk shares hard-won advice on how to connect with customers and beat the competition.When managers, marketers, and small business owners outline their social media strategies, they plan for the `right hook`&#8211;their next campaign that will produce profits. Even companies committed to `jabbing`&#8211;creating content for consumers and engaging with customers to build relationships&#8211;still desperately want to land the powerful, bruising swing that will knock out their opponents or their customers&#8217; resistance in one tooth-shattering, killer blow. Right hooks, after all, convert traffic to sales. They easily show results and return on investment. Except when they don&#8217;t.In the same passionate, streetwise style his readers have come to expect, Vaynerchuk is on a mission to strengthen marketers&#8217; right hooks by changing the way they fight to make their consumers happy, and ultimately to compete. Thanks to the massive change in and proliferation of social media platforms in the last four years, the winning combination of jabs and right hooks is different now. Communication is still key, but context matters more than ever. It&#8217;s not just about developing high-quality content; it&#8217;s also about developing high-quality content that&#8217;s perfectly adapted to specific social media platforms and mobile devices. It&#8217;s about truly engaging with customers, not by shouting at them over social media but by using new narrative forms particular to each different media platform&#8211;especially, though not exclusively, Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, and Tumblr. Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook is a blueprint to social media marketing strategies that really work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kevin Plank was relatively small for an American footballer, and when he weighed the cotton T-shirt he wore under his team uniform, he found it weighed three pounds because it was so drenched in sweat. Knowing he couldn&#8217;t hinder himself in this way, he set about finding a material that wasn&#8217;t so absorbent. Going to a local fabric shop, he soon learned that synthetic materials would not take in as much sweat, so he had a shirt made and found it added just four ounces over the course of a game. When he gave some team-mates samples to try, they also soon saw the advantages. He began to produce the shirts commercially, and now Under Armour is a $2 billion global brand used by people from every sport.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with fascinating and inspirational tales of success, Amy Wilkinson&#8217;s brilliant book explains the six essential skills required by entrepreneurs to achieve their dreams. Based on in-depth interviews with the founders of numerous global brands, from eBay to Spanx, from LinkedIn to PayPal, she shows just what they did and what set them apart. For the key to being a successful entrepreneur isn&#8217;t necessarily about being &#8216;first&#8217;, it is about being the &#8216;only&#8217; one, and devising a new formula where none previously existed. Above all, these stories show how &#8211; if you follow the right steps &#8211; anyone can become a successful entrepreneur.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You won&#8217;t find a more honest, raw and helpful look into the trenches of founding a tech startup than this book&#8217; Nir Eyal, author of Hooked    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Rand Fishkin is the real deal&#8217; Seth Godin, entrepreneur and author     </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    Everyone knows how a startup story is supposed to go: a young, brilliant entrepreneur has an cool idea, drops out of college, defies the doubters, overcomes all odds, makes billions and becomes the envy of the technology world.     </p>
<p>                    This is not that story.    </p>
<p>                    Rand Fishkin, the founder and former CEO of Moz, is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on SEO. Moz is now a $45 million a year business, but Fishkin&#8217;s business and reputation took 15 years to grow, and his startup began not in a Harvard dorm room but as a mother-and-son family business that fell deeply into debt.     </p>
<p>                    Now Fishkin pulls back the curtain on tech startup mythology, exposing the ups and downs of startup life that most CEOs would rather keep secret. For instance: a minimally viable product can be destructive if you launch at the wrong moment. Growth hacking may be the buzzword du jour, but initiatives to your business can fizzle quickly. Revenue and profitability won&#8217;t protect you from layoffs. And venture capital always comes with strings attached.     </p>
<p>                    In Lost and Founder Fishkin reveals the mostly awful, sometimes awesome truth about startup culture with the transparency and humour that his hundreds of thousands of blog readers have come to love. Fishkin&#8217;s hard-won lessons are applicable to any kind of business environment and this book can help solve your problems, and make you feel less alone for having them.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is a truly courageous book. It&#8217;s one part business-building guide and two parts Indiana Jones-style adventure memoir&#8217; Chris Guillebeau, author of Side Hustle and The $100 Startup    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Rand Fishkin is like the industry friend we all wish we had &#8211; funny, warm, and refreshingly honest about the rollercoaster ride that is founding your own company&#8217; Julie Zhou, VP of Product Design at Facebook</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steve Case&#8217;s career began when he cofounded America Online (AOL) in 1985. At the time, only three percent of Americans were online. It took a decade for AOL to achieve mainstream success. AOL became the top performing company of the 1990s, and at its peak more than half of all consumer Internet traffic in the United States ran through the service. After Case engineered AOL&#8217;s merger with Time Warner and he became Chairman of the combined business, Case oversaw the biggest media and communications empire in the world.<br />
                         In The Third Wave, which pays homage to the work of the futurist Alvin Toffler, Case takes us behind the scenes of some of the most consequential and riveting business decisions of our time while offering illuminating insights from decades of working as an entrepreneur, an investor, a philanthropist, and an advocate for sensible bipartisan policies.<br />
                         We are entering, as Case explains, a new paradigm called the &#8220;Third Wave&#8221; of the Internet. The first wave saw AOL and other companies lay the foundation for consumers to connect to the Internet. The second wave saw companies like Google and Facebook build on top of the Internet to create search and social networking capabilities, while apps like Snapchat and Instagram leverage the smartphone revolution. Now, Case argues, we&#8217;re entering the Third Wave: a period in which entrepreneurs will vastly transform major &#8220;real world&#8221; sectors like health, education, transportation, energy, and food-and in the process change the way we live our daily lives.<br />
                         The Third Wave is part memoir, part manifesto, and part playbook for the future.</p>

<p>                    Many companies are good at acquiring new product prototypes but bad at working out what they would do when they arrived at the front door. Many just give up, lacking the &#8216;How&#8217; to go with the &#8216;Wow&#8217;. Using a unique two-sided approach to innovation involving both the Money and the Magic and in the process turning traditional orthodoxies about brainstorming on their head, Mark Payne reveals how to explore every potential idea with the end goal in mind-bringing an innovative product to market in a way that will transform a company&#8217;s business and growth.</p>

<p>                    What do all successful businesses have in common? They&#8217;re the first name that comes to mind when people think about their particular market. How do companies achieve this? By developing habits and strategies that focus on building meaningful relationships and delivering value consistently, day in and day out.    </p>
<p>                    In Top of Mind, the cofounder of a leading content marketing company shows you how to create business opportunities by occupying the space at the top of your audience&#8217;s minds-and keeping it there. This groundbreaking book explains how consumer needs and expectations have changed and what this shift means for readers interested in building a brand-whether you&#8217;re a leader in marketing engaging potential customers, a VP of sales bringing in new business, or a director of HR who&#8217;s recruiting the best talent in the industry. It provides effective ways to establish trust and foster connections; maintain transparency and consistency; identify and clearly communicate the &#8220;why&#8221; behind the message; and create processes to make that message part of a brand&#8217;s DNA.     </p>
<p>                    Maintaining a prominent spot in your audience&#8217;s minds will increase the likelihood that the moment they need to make a choice, you&#8217;ll be the first one they call.</p>

                         Across the globe, diverse innovators are working in the black, grey, and informal economies to develop solutions to myriad challenges. Far from being &#8220;deviant entrepreneurs&#8221; that pose threats to our social and economic stability, these innovators display remarkable ingenuity, pioneering original methods and best practices that we can learn from and apply to formal markets in urgent need of change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be Fearless is researched-based call to action for those seeking to live extraordinary lives and bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    LOS ANGELES TIMES BESTSELLER * NATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Weaving together storytelling, practical tips and inspiration, the book will teach you how to put the five fearless principles to work so that you too can spark the sorts of remarkable breakthroughs that can impact the world. Philanthropist, investor, and technology pioneer Jean Case brings to life the five Be Fearless principles common to the people and organizations that bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found five surprising traits they all had in common. These weren&#8217;t wealth, privilege, or even genius. What all of these exceptional men and women shared was that they had chosen to make a &#8220;big bet,&#8221; take bold risks, learn from their failures, reach beyond their bubbles, and let urgency conquer fear.    </p>
<p>                    Throughout Be Fearless, Jean vividly illustrates these principles through storytelling-from her own transformational life experiences, to Jane Goodall&#8217;s remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and protecting chimpanzees, to celebrity chef Jose Andres&#8217; decision to be a &#8220;first responder&#8221; and take his kitchen to the sites of devastating hurricanes to feed the hungry, to Madame C.J. Walker&#8217;s vision to build a hair care empire that would employ thousands across the country, and more. She shares new insights to stories you might think you know-like Airbnb&#8217;s tale of starting from scratch to transform the hospitality industry, to John F. Kennedy&#8217;s history-making moonshot-and gems from changemakers you&#8217;ve never heard of. Be Fearless features a compelling foreword from Jane Goodall saying &#8220;there is no time in history when it has been more important to Be Fearless&#8221; and a new afterword with stories of people inspired to take action after reading the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In less than a decade, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Andy Grove founded three companies that would define the world of technology and transform our lives. At their peaks, Microsoft, Apple, and Intel were collectively worth some $1.5 trillion. Strategy Rules examines these three individuals collectively for the first time &#8211; their successes and failures, commonalities and differences &#8211; revealing the business strategies and practices they pioneered while building their firms. David B. Yoffie and Michael A. Cusumano have studied these three leaders and their companies for more than thirty years, while teaching business strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship at Harvard and MIT. In this enlightening guide, they show how Gates, Grove, and Jobs approached strategy and execution in remarkably similar ways &#8211; yet markedly differently from their erstwhile competitors &#8211; keeping their focus on five strategic rules. Strategy Rules brings together the best practices in strategic management and high-tech entrepreneurship from three path-breaking entrepreneurs who emerged as CEOs of huge global companies.<br />
                    Their approaches to formulating strategy and building organizations offer unique insights for start-up executives as well as the heads of modern multinationals.</p>

<p>                    The Starving Artist Is a Myth    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times: There&#8217;s no money in art. It&#8217;s too risky. You&#8217;ll starve. So, we end up chasing more stable careers. We become lawyers and doctors and bankers instead of poets and filmmakers and painters. We settle. And in the end our best work suffers.    </p>
<p>                    The truth is we do not have to choose between a creative life and a prosperous one. In fact, many of history&#8217;s most creative minds-from Michelangelo to Shakespeare to Steve Jobs-succeeded not because they succumbed to the myth of the starving artist but precisely because they didn&#8217;t.    </p>
<p>                    Today we live in a New Renaissance, an era of unprecedented opportunity in which you can share your creative work without fear of suffering or starving. Drawing lessons from the likes of Jim Henson, C. S. Lewis, Dr. Dre, and many others, bestselling author and entrepreneur Jeff Goins invites us to drop the myths, worries, and flat-out lies that have been drilled into us our entire lives and instead reveals an empowering truth: Real artists don&#8217;t starve. They THRIVE.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the millionaire entrepreneur and New York Times bestselling author of The 10X Rule comes a bold and contrarian wake-up call for anyone truly ready for success. One of the 7 best motivational books of 2016, according to Inc. Magazine.    </p>
<p>                     Before Grant Cardone built five successful companies (and counting), became a multimillionaire, and wrote bestselling books&#8230; he was broke, jobless, and drug-addicted.     </p>
<p>                     Grant had grown up with big dreams, but friends and family told him to be more reasonable and less demanding. If he played by the rules, they said, he could enjoy everyone else&#8217;s version of middle class success. But when he tried it their way, he hit rock bottom.     </p>
<p>                     Then he tried the opposite approach. He said NO to the haters and naysayers and said YES to his burning, outrageous, animal obsession. He reclaimed his obsession with wanting to be a business rock star, a super salesman, a huge philanthropist. He wanted to live in a mansion and even own an airplane.     </p>
<p>                     Obsession made all of his wildest dreams come true. And it can help you achieve massive success too. As Grant says, we&#8217;re in the middle of an epidemic of average. The conventional wisdom is to seek balance and take it easy. But that has really just given us an excuse to be unexceptional.     </p>
<p>                    If you want real success, you have to know how to harness your obsession to rocket to the top. This book will give you the inspiration and tools to break out of your cocoon of mediocrity and achieve your craziest dreams. Grant will teach you how to:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Set crazy goals&#8211;and reach them, every single day.<br />
                     &#8211; Feed the beast: when you value money and spend it on the right things, you get more of it.<br />
                     &#8211; Shut down the doubters&#8211;and use your haters as fuel.     </p>
<p>                    Whether you&#8217;re a sales person, small business owner, or 9-to-5 working stiff, your path to happiness runs though your obsessions. It&#8217;s a simple choice: be obsessed or be average.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Young serial entrepreneur Scott Gerber is not the product of a wealthy family or storied entrepreneurial heritage. Nor is he the outcome of a traditional business school education or a corporate executive turned entrepreneur. Rather, he is a hard-working, self-taught 26-year-old hustler, rainmaker, and bootstrapper who has survived and thrived despite never having held the proverbial &#8220;real job. In  Never Get a &#8220;Real&#8221; Job: How to Dump Your Boss, Build a Business, and Not Go Broke, Gerber challenges the social conventions behind the &#8220;real&#8221; job and empowers young people to take control of their lives and dump their nine-to-fives or their quest to attain them. Drawing upon case studies, experiences, and observations, Scott dissects failures, shares hard-learned lessons, and presents practical, affordable, and systematic action steps to building, managing, and marketing a successful business on a shoestring budget. The proven, no-b.s. methodology presented in  Never Get a &#8220;Real&#8221; Job teaches unemployed and underemployed Gen-Yers, aspiring small business owners, students, and recent college graduates how to quit 9-to-5s, become their own bosses, and achieve financial independence.</p>

<p>                    Side Hustle is about much more than just making some extra cash; it&#8217;s about freedom and job security in today&#8217;s unstable business environment.

<p>                    In the style of $100 Startup, full of practical exercises and peppered with inspiring stories, Chris Guillebeau&#8217;s Side Hustle shows readers how to brainstorm, choose, implement, launch and refine their side business in just 27 days &#8211; with little to no budget and without having to quit their current job.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When a pseudonymous programmer introduced &#8220;a new electronic cash system that&#8217;s fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party&#8221; to a small online mailing list in 2008, very few paid attention. Ten years later, and against all odds, this upstart autonomous decentralized software offers an unstoppable and globally-accessible hard money alternative to modern central banks. The Bitcoin Standard analyzes the historical context to the rise of Bitcoin, the economic properties that have allowed it to grow quickly, and its likely economic, political, and social implications.    </p>
<p>                     While Bitcoin is a new invention of the digital age, the problem it purports to solve is as old as human society itself: transferring value across time and space. Ammous takes the reader on an engaging journey through the history of technologies performing the functions of money, from primitive systems of trading limestones and seashells, to metals, coins, the gold standard, and modern government debt. Exploring what gave these technologies their monetary role, and how most lost it, provides the reader with a good idea of what makes for sound money, and sets the stage for an economic discussion of its consequences for individual and societal future-orientation, capital accumulation, trade, peace, culture, and art. Compellingly, Ammous shows that it is no coincidence that the loftiest achievements of humanity have come in societies enjoying the benefits of sound monetary regimes, nor is it coincidental that monetary collapse has usually accompanied civilizational collapse.    </p>
<p>                     With this background in place, the book moves on to explain the operation of Bitcoin in a functional and intuitive way. Bitcoin is a decentralized, distributed piece of software that converts electricity and processing power into indisputably accurate records, thus allowing its users to utilize the Internet to perform the traditional functions of money without having to rely on, or trust, any authorities or infrastructure in the physical world. Bitcoin is thus best understood as the first successfully implemented form of digital cash and digital hard money. With an automated and perfectly predictable monetary policy, and the ability to perform final settlement of large sums across the world in a matter of minutes, Bitcoin&#8217;s real competitive edge might just be as a store of value and network for final settlement of large payments-a digital form of gold with a built-in settlement infrastructure.    </p>
<p>                     Ammous&#8217; firm grasp of the technological possibilities as well as the historical realities of monetary evolution provides for a fascinating exploration of the ramifications of voluntary free market money. As it challenges the most sacred of government monopolies, Bitcoin shifts the pendulum of sovereignty away from governments in favor of individuals, offering us the tantalizing possibility of a world where money is fully extricated from politics and unrestrained by borders.    </p>
<p>                     The final chapter of the book explores some of the most common questions surrounding Bitcoin: Is Bitcoin mining a waste of energy? Is Bitcoin for criminals? Who controls Bitcoin, and can they change it if they please? How can Bitcoin be killed? And what to make of all the thousands of Bitcoin knock-offs, and the many supposed applications of Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8216;blockchain technology&#8217;? The Bitcoin Standard is the essential resource for a clear understanding of the rise of the Internet&#8217;s decentralized, apolitical, free-market alternative to national central banks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Proven principles for sustainable success, with new leadership insight    </p>
<p>                     PEAK is the popular, transformative guide to doing business better, written by a seasoned entrepreneur/CEO who has disrupted his favorite industry not once, but twice. Author Chip Conley, founder and former CEO of one of the world&#8217;s largest boutique hotel companies, turned to psychologist Abraham Maslow&#8217;s Hierarchy of Needs at a time when his company was in dire need. And years later, when the young founders of Airbnb asked him to help turn their start-up home sharing company into a world-class hospitality giant, Conley once again used the principles he&#8217;d developed in PEAK. In the decade since this book&#8217;s first edition, Conley&#8217;s PEAK strategy has been developed on six continents in organizations in virtually every industry. The author&#8217;s foundational premise is that great leaders become amateur psychologists by understanding the unique needs of three key relationships-with employees, customers, and investors-and this message has resonated with every kind of leader and company including some of the world&#8217;s best-known, from Apple to Facebook. Avid users of PEAK have found that the principles create greater loyalty and differentiation with their key stakeholders. This new second edition includes in-depth examples of real-world PEAK companies, including the author&#8217;s own at Airbnb, and exclusive PEAK leadership practices that will take you-and your company&#8217;s performance-to new heights.    </p>
<p>                     Whether you&#8217;re at a startup or a Fortune 500 company, at a for-profit, nonprofit, or governmental organization, this book can help you and your people reach potential you never realized you had.    </p>
<p>                    Understand how Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy makes for winning business practices<br />
                    Learn how PEAK drove some of today&#8217;s top businesses to success<br />
                    Help employees reach their full potential-and beyond    </p>
<p>                    Transform the customer experience and keep investors happy    </p>
<p>                     The PEAK framework succeeds because it elevates the business from the inside out. These same principles apply in the boardroom, the breakroom, and your living room at home, and have proven to be the foundation of healthy, fulfilled lives. Even if you think you&#8217;re doing great, you could always be doing better-and PEAK gives you a roadmap to the next level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    An adrenaline-fuelled expose of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio Garcia Martinez, this is Liar&#8217;s Poker meets The Social Network.     </p>
<p>                    Computer engineers use &#8216;chaos monkey&#8217; software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio Garcia Martinez are society&#8217;s chaos monkeys &#8211; their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) &#8211; all in search of the perfect business miracle.      </p>
<p>                    Describing himself as &#8216;high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times&#8217;, Garcia Martinez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook&#8217;s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users&#8217; data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark &#8216;Zuck&#8217; Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, Garcia Martinez  took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg&#8217;s desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.    </p>
<p>                    In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW &#8211; and HOW NOT &#8211; to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing.  Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, Garcia Martinez  unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital &#8216;privacy&#8217;, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*#GIRLBOSS NETFLIX ORIGINAL OUT NOW*    </p>
<p>                    In this New York Times bestselling sensation, founder and Executive Chairman of Nasty Gal Sophia Amoruso shares her story and inspires women everywhere to join the #GIRLBOSS movement.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;#GIRLBOSS is more than a book . . . #GIRLBOSS is a movement&#8217; Lena Dunham    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A millennial alternative to Lean In&#8217; New York Magazine    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compellingly motivational read&#8217; The Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The book you need in your life&#8217; Marie Claire     </p>
<p>                    *Winner of the 2014 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Business Book*    </p>
<p>                    In the space of ten years, Sophia Amoruso has gone from high-school dropout to founder and Executive Chairman of Nasty Gal, one of the fastest-growing retailers in the world.     </p>
<p>                    Sophia&#8217;s never been a typical executive, or a typical anything, and she&#8217;s written #GIRLBOSS for other girls like her: outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success.    </p>
<p>                    Filled with brazen wake-up calls, cunning and frank observations, and behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty Gal&#8217;s meteoric rise, #GIRLBOSS covers a lot of ground. It proves that success doesn&#8217;t come from where you went to college or how popular you were in school. Success is about trusting your instincts and following your gut, knowing which rules to follow and which to break.    </p>
<p>                    Inspiring, motivating and empowering, #GIRLBOSS will give you the kick up the ass you need to reach your potential.</p>

<p>                     Perhaps surprisingly, they do it very differently than most tech companies.    </p>
<p>                     In INSPIRED, technology product management thought leader Marty Cagan provides readers with a master class in how to structure and staff a vibrant and successful product organization, and how to discover and deliver technology products that your customers will love-and that will work for your business.    </p>
<p>                     With sections on assembling the right people and skillsets, discovering the right product, embracing an effective yet lightweight process, and creating a strong product culture, readers can take the information they learn and immediately leverage it within their own organizations-dramatically improving their own product efforts.    </p>
<p>                     Whether you&#8217;re an early stage startup working to get to product/market fit, or a growth-stage company working to scale your product organization, or a large, long-established company trying to regain your ability to consistently deliver new value for your customers, INSPIRED will take you and your product organization to a new level of customer engagement, consistent innovation, and business success.    </p>
<p>                     Filled with the author&#8217;s own personal stories-and profiles of some of today&#8217;s most-successful product managers and technology-powered product companies, including Adobe, Apple, BBC, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix-INSPIRED will show you how to turn up the dial of your own product efforts, creating technology products your customers love.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change is the only constant.  Learn to be a change-maker.    </p>
<p>                    In Imagine It Forward, Beth Comstock, the former vice chair of GE, describes her twenty-five year efforts to be an instigator of change at every level of business. When she first moved from NBC to parent company GE in 1998, she was ignored as a woman in a man&#8217;s world, treated as an outsider because she didn&#8217;t have a business background, and ignored as a mere PR person. But CEO Jeff Immelt realized even then that the industrial giant, like so many businesses, had to change fast in order to stay relevant in a world where Google, Facebook, and an explosion of internet companies were transforming how goods and services were marketed, made, and sold.    </p>
<p>                    In a deeply personal journey filled with practical takeaways from two plus decades of initiating change at the top levels of one of the largest corporations in the world, Comstock lays out the challenges, opportunities, tools, and practices needed to embrace change, whatever industry you are in, and make it part of every management decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The real story of what it takes to risk it all and go for broke. Conventional wisdom says most startups need to be in Silicon Valley, started by young engineers around a sexy new idea, and backed by VC funding. But as Mikkel Svane reveals in Startupland, the story of founding Zendesk was anything but conventional. Founded in a Copenhagen loft by three thirty-something friends looking to break free from corporate doldrums, Zendesk Inc. is now one of the hottest enterprise software companies, still rapidly growing with customers in 150 countries. But its success was anything but predestined. With revealing stories both funny and frank, Mikkel shares how he and his friends bravely left secure jobs to start something on their own, how he almost went broke several times, how they picked up themselves and their families to travel across the world to California and the unknown, and how the three friends were miraculously still together for Zendesk&#8217;s IPO and (still growing) success.<br />
                    Much like Zendesk&#8217;s mission itself to remove friction, barriers, and mystery in order to make customer service easier and more approachable Startupland removes some of the myths about startups and startup founders. Mikkel&#8217;s advice, hard-won through experience, often bucks conventional wisdom and entrepreneurial tropes. He shares why failure (whether fast or slow) is awful, why a seemingly boring product or idea can be the most exciting, why giving back to the community is as important as the bottom line. From how to hire right (look for people who are not offended by swearing) to which personas generate the highest response rates, Mikkel answers the most pressing questions from the perspective of someone still in the trenches and willing to share the hard truth, warts and all. While there are books by consultants who tell you how to build businesses, or by entrepreneurs now running billion-dollar businesses, there are few books from people still in the trenches who acutely remember the difficult daily decisions, the thrill (and fears) of the early days, the problems that scale with growing a business, and the reason why they all went on the adventure in the first place.<br />
                    Startupland is indispensable reading for all entrepreneurs who want to make their ideas the next big thing. The book will inspire and empower you to follow your own dream and create your own story.</p>

<p>                    If Facebook were a country, it would be the third largest in the world.<br />

<p>                    There&#8217;s no doubt about it. Mark Zuckerberg&#8217;s creation has changed the world. Literally. Facebook has singlehandedly revolutionized the way more than one-seventh of the world&#8217;s population communicates, engages, and consumes information.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thomas Edison famously said that genius is 1% inspiration, 99% perspiration. Every day new solutions, revolutionary cures, and artistic breakthroughs are conceived and squandered by smart people. Along with the gift of creativity come the obstacles to making ideas happen: lack of organisation, lack of accountability and a lack of community support.    </p>
<p>                    Scott Belsky has interviewsed hundreds of the most productive creative people and teams in the world, revealing one common trait: a carefully trained capacity for executing ideas. Implementing your ideas is a skill that can be taught, and Belsky distills the core principles in this book.    </p>
<p>                    While many of us obsess about discovering great new ideas, Belsky shows why it is better to develop the capacity to make ideas happen &#8211; using old-fashioned passion and perspiration. Making Ideas Happen reveals the practical yet counterintuitive techniques of &#8216;serial creatives&#8217; &#8211; those few who make their visions a reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A refreshing approach to entrepreneurship centered on staying small and avoiding growth &#8211; maximizing happiness, sustainability and profitability.    </p>
<p>                    Paul Jarvis left the corporate world when he realized that working in a high-pressure, high-profile world was not his idea of success. Instead, he now works for himself out of his home, and lives a much more rewarding and productive life. He no longer has to contend with an environment that constantly demands more productivity, more output and more growth.    </p>
<p>                    In Company of One, Jarvis explains how you can do the same, including:    </p>
<p>                    *         Planning to set up<br />
                    *         Determining desired revenues<br />
                    *         Keeping clients happy<br />
                    *         And, of course, doing all this on your own.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Jarvis makes a compelling case for making your business better instead of bigger. A must-read for any entrepreneur who prioritizes a rich life over riches.&#8221;<br />
                     -CAL NEWPORT, bestselling author of DEEP WORK and DIGITAL MINIMALISM    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;You&#8217;re not a machine, so why would you run your business like one? Company of One shows you another way. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how to have a business that works for you-instead of the other way around-you need this book.&#8221;<br />
                    -CHRIS GUILLEBEAU, bestselling author of SIDE HUSTLE and THE $100 STARTUP</p>

<p>                    You think you have it rough?     </p>
<p>                    Only ten days before Abraham Lincoln took the oath of office in 1861, the Confederate States of America seceded from the Union, taking all Federal agencies, forts, and arenas within their territory. To make matters worse, Lincoln, who was elected by a minority of the popular vote, was thought of by his own advisors as nothing more than a gawky second-rate country lawyer with no leadership experience.     </p>
<p>                    What Lincoln did to become our most honored and revered president is history; now his wisdom and leadership philosophy can help you run your business. In Lincoln on Leadership you&#8217;ll discover why you should:<br />
                    Seize the initiative and never relinquish it.Wage only one war at a time.Avoid issuing order and instead request, imply, or make suggestions.Once in a while, let things slip, unbeknownst-like&#8230; and much much more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Wood discovered his passion, his greatest success, and his life&#8217;s work not at business school or helping lead Microsoft&#8217;s charge into Asia in the 1990s but on a soul-searching trip to the Himalayas. He made the difficult decision to walk away from his lucrative career to create Room to Read, a nonprofit organization that promotes education across the developing world. By the end of 2007, the organization will have established over 5,000 libraries and 400 schools, and awarded long-term scholarships to more than 3,000 girls, giving more than one million children the lifelong gift of education.     </p>
<p>                    If you have ever pondered abandoning your desk job for an adventure and an opportunity to give back, Wood&#8217;s story will inspire you. He offers a vivid, emotional, and absorbing tale of how to take the lessons learned at a hard-charging company like Microsoft and apply them to the world&#8217;s most pressing social problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gripping read&#8217; Adam Grant, bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    Reddit hails itself as &#8216;the front page of the Internet&#8217;. It&#8217;s the sixth most-visited website in the world &#8211; and yet, millions have no idea what it is. They should be paying attention.    </p>
<p>                    This definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit is perfect for readers of The Everything Store, Googled and The Facebook Effect.    </p>
<p>                    We Are the Nerds takes readers inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving crimes and spurring millions in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and even landing Donald Trump in the White House. Reddit has become a mirror of the Internet itself: It has dark trenches, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a heart-warming ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.    </p>
<p>                    This is the gripping story of how Reddit&#8217;s founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, transformed themselves from student video-gamers into Silicon Valley millionaires as they turned their creation into an icon of the digital age. But the journey was often fraught. Reporting on Reddit for more than six years, conducting hundreds of interviews and gaining exclusive access to its founders, Christine Lagorio-Chafkin has written the definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit. Packed with revelatory details about its biggest triumphs and controversies, this inside look at Reddit includes fresh insights on the relationship between Huffman and Ohanian, staff turmoil, the tragic life of Aaron Swartz, and Reddit&#8217;s struggle to become profitable.    </p>
<p>                    In a time when we are increasingly concerned about privacy and manipulation on social platforms, We Are the Nerds reveals Reddit&#8217;s central role in the dissemination of culture and information in history&#8217;s first fully digital century. Rigorously reported and highly entertaining, We Are the Nerds explores how this unique platform has changed the way we all communicate today.    </p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Incisive, witty and brilliantly written&#8217; &#8211; Emily Chang, bestselling author of Brotopia    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A triumph &#8211; a business book that reads like a page-turning novel&#8217; &#8211; James Ledbetter, author of One Nation Under Gold    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The best, grittiest, most accurate book yet about what it&#8217;s like to build a startup and a community from scratch&#8217; &#8211; John Zeratsky, bestselling author of Sprint and Make Time    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A gripping, entertaining book that is a must-read for every entrepreneur&#8217; &#8211; Daymond John, bestselling author of Rise and Grind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Too many books on tech feel like they have been Googled together; Lagorio-Chafkin&#8217;s is rich in original reportage&#8217; &#8211; TLS</p>

<p>                    A Top 3 &#8216;Start Your Own Business&#8217; Book -Inc Magazine    </p>
<p>                    The rapid development of technology and globalization has changed the leverage points in accumulating wealth: money, meaning and freedom. Those that don&#8217;t adapt are becoming trapped in the downward spiral of a dying middle class &#8211; working harder and earning less. Entrepreneurs that understand the new paradigm, have created unprecedented wealth in their lives and the lives of those they love.    </p>
<p>                    In This Book You&#8217;ll Learn:     </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why the century-long growth in wages came to a halt in 2000.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why MBAs and JDs can&#8217;t get jobs and what that means for the future of work and your job.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why The Theory of Constraints and a shift into the Fourth Economy has made entrepreneurship the highest-leveraged career path for the young and ambitious.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why The Turkey Problem means accounting may be the riskiest profession in the 21st century while entrepreneurship may be the safest.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; How entrepreneurs with second-rate degrees are leveraging the radical democracy of the Long Tail to get rich.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; How the Stair Step Method and return of apprenticeships have transformed the &#8220;entrepreneurial leap&#8221; to make entrepreneurship at large, and small business entrepreneurship in particular, more accessible than ever.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; The scientific research on how giving up balanced living and embracing integrated living leads to more money, more meaning, and more freedom.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why a 20th century world view to career search questions like &#8220;What career is right for me?&#8221; and &#8220;How do I find a career?&#8221; could be the source of your frustration (and a better way to think about it)    </p>

<p>                    &#8212; Taylor&#8217;s 67 must-read business books and the best entrepreneur books to fuel your entrepreneurial career.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Business of Good narrates the story behind social entrepreneurship as told by the individuals compelled to create a change in the world&#8211;not just another business. Serial and social entrepreneur Jason Haber intertwines case studies and anecdotes that show how social entrepreneurship is creating jobs, growing the economy, and ultimately changing the world.  From Main Street to Wall Street, today&#8217;s social entrepreneurs are rebooting capitalism, challenging the charity industrial complex, and disrupting business models.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Robin Chase cofounded Zipcar, she not only started a business but established the foundation for one of the most important economic and social ideas of our time: the collaborative economy. With this important audiobook, she broadens our thinking about the ways in which the economy is being transformed and shows how the Peers Inc model is changing the very nature of capitalism.     </p>
<p>                    When the best of people power is combined with the best of corporate power to form &#8220;Peers Inc&#8221; organizations, a potent creative force is released. The &#8220;Inc&#8221; in these collaborations delivers the industrial strengths of significant scale and resources, and the &#8220;Peers&#8221; bring together the individual strengths of localization, specialization, and customization, unlocking the power of the collaborative economy. When excess capacity is harnessed by the platform and diverse peers participate, a completely new dynamic is unleashed.     </p>
<p>                    In Peers Inc, Robin Chase brings her provocative insights to work, business, the economy, and the environment, showing: How focusing on excess capacity transforms the economics of what&#8217;s possible and delivers abundance to all How the new collaboration between the Inc and the Peers enables companies to grow more quickly, learn faster, and deliver smarter products and services How leveraging the Peers Inc model can address climate change with the necessary speed and scale How the Peers Inc model can help legacy companies overcome their shortening life cycle by inviting innovation and evolution Why power parity between the Peers and the Inc is a prerequisite for long-term success How platforms can be built within the existing financial system or outside of it What government can do to enhance economic possibility and protect people working in this new decentralized world</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>E-Myth  &#8216;e-,&#8217;mith n 1: the entrepreneurial myth: the myth that most people who start small businesses are entrepreneurs 2: the fatal assumption that an individual who understands the technical work of a business can successfully run a business that does that technical work  Voted #1 business book by Inc. 500 CEOs.  An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.  Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business-from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed-and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business.<br />
                    The E-Myth Revisited will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An inspiring personal story of redemption, second chances, and the transformative power within us all, from the founder and CEO of the nonprofit charity: water.    </p>
<p>                    At 28 years old, Scott Harrison had it all. A top nightclub promoter in New York City, his life was an endless cycle of drugs, booze, models&#8211;repeat. But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, What would the exact opposite of my life look like? Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling. In 2006, with no money and less than no experience, Harrison founded charity: water. Today, his organization has raised over $400 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 10 million people around the globe.     </p>
<p>                    In Thirst, Harrison recounts the twists and turns that built charity: water into one of the most trusted and admired nonprofits in the world. Renowned for its 100% donation model, bold storytelling, imaginative branding, and radical commitment to transparency, charity: water has disrupted how social entrepreneurs work while inspiring millions of people to join its mission of bringing clean water to everyone on the planet within our lifetime.     </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of such bestselling books as Shoe Dog and Mountains Beyond Mountains, Thirst is a riveting account of how to build a better charity, a better business, a better life&#8211;and a gritty tale that proves it&#8217;s never too late to make a change.     </p>
<p>                    100% of the author&#8217;s net proceeds from Thirst will go to fund charity: water projects around the world.</p>

<p>                    They say you shouldn&#8217;t ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you. This is technically true, but it misses the point. You shouldn&#8217;t ask anyone  if your business is a good idea. It&#8217;s a bad question and everyone will lie to you at least a little . As a matter of fact, it&#8217;s not their responsibility to tell you the truth. It&#8217;s your responsibility to find it and it&#8217;s worth doing right .    </p>
<p>                    Talking to customers is one of the foundational skills of both Customer Development and Lean Startup. We all know we&#8217;re supposed to do it, but nobody seems willing to admit that it&#8217;s easy to screw up and hard to do right. This book is going to show you how customer conversations go wrong and how you can do better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the financial plan of mediocrity &#8212; a dream-stealing, soul-sucking dogma known as &#8220;The Slowlane&#8221; your plan for creating wealth? You know how it goes; it sounds a little something like this: &#8220;Go to school, get a good job, save 10% of your paycheck, buy a used car, cancel the movie channels, quit drinking expensive Starbucks lattes, save and penny-pinch your life away, trust your life-savings to the stock market, and one day, when you are oh, say, 65 years old, you can retire rich.&#8221; The mainstream financial gurus have sold you blindly down the river to a great financial gamble: You&#8217;ve been hoodwinked to believe that wealth can be created by recklessly trusting in the uncontrollable and unpredictable markets: the housing market, the stock market, and the job market. This impotent financial gamble dubiously promises wealth in a wheelchair &#8212; sacrifice your adult life for a financial plan that reaps dividends in the twilight of life. Accept the Slowlane as your blueprint for wealth and your financial future will blow carelessly asunder on a sailboat of HOPE: HOPE you can find a job and keep it, HOPE the stock market doesn&#8217;t tank, HOPE the economy rebounds, HOPE, HOPE, and HOPE.<br />
                    Do you really want HOPE to be the centerpiece for your family&#8217;s financial plan? Drive the Slowlane road and you will find your life deteriorate into a miserable exhibition about what you cannot do, versus what you can. For those who don&#8217;t want a lifetime subscription to mediocrity and a slight chance of elderly riches, there is an alternative; an expressway to extraordinary wealth that can burn a trail to financial independence faster than any road out there. &#8212; Why jobs, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and 40-years of mindless frugality will never make you rich young. &#8212; Why most entrepreneurs fail and how to immediately put the odds in your favor. &#8212; The real law of wealth: Leverage this and wealth has no choice but to be magnetized to you. &#8212; The leading cause of poorness: Change this and you change everything. &#8211;How the rich really get rich &#8211; and no, it has nothing to do with a paycheck or a 401K match. &#8212; Why the guru&#8217;s grand deity &#8211; compound interest &#8211; is an impotent wealth accelerator. &#8212; Why the guru myth of &#8220;do what you love&#8221; will most likely keep you poor, not rich. &#8212; And 250+ more poverty busting distinctions.</p>

Smart People Should Build Things offers a stark picture of the current culture and a revolutionary model that will redirect a generation of ambitious young people to the critical job of innovating and building new businesses.    </p>
<p>                    As the Founder and CEO of Venture for America, Andrew Yang places top college graduates in start-ups for two years in emerging U.S. cities to generate job growth and train the next generation of entrepreneurs. He knows firsthand how our current view of education is broken. Many college graduates aspire to finance, consulting, law school, grad school, or medical school out of a vague desire for additional status and progress rather than from a genuine passion or fit.    </p>
<p>                    In Smart People Should Build Things, this self-described &#8220;recovering lawyer&#8221; and entrepreneur weaves together a compelling narrative of success stories (including his own), offering observations about the flow of talent in the United States and explanations of why current trends are leading to economic distress and cultural decline. He also presents recommendations for both policy makers and job seekers to make entrepreneurship more realistic and achievable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A great idea isn&#8217;t a sudden light-bulb moment. It&#8217;s taking something familiar and making it feel new.     </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;ve been told a lie about the nature of creativity.    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re told stories about creative geniuses &#8211; the young Mozart who effortlessly overshadows the hardworking Salieri; Paul McCartney coming up with the tune for Yesterday in a dream one morning; JK Rowling finding inspiration for Harry Potter sitting on a train to London.  What we aren&#8217;t told is the actual story behind such hits.  In fact there is a science and method for mainstream success, whether writing a popular novel, starting a company or creating an effective marketing campaign, and in this book Allen Gannett &#8211; data wizard and successful entrepreneur &#8211; reveals the four laws of creativity that are proven to work.    </p>
<p>                    New ideas are surprising at first, and slowly become familiar as we get used to them.  Allan Gannett reveals there&#8217;s a sweet spot between what feels familiar and safe to us, and what is innovative and new: the point of optimal tension between safety and surprise, similarity and difference.  The people we think of as creative geniuses are people who understand this sweet spot instinctively; they know what people find familiar and reassuring, and they find ways to reinvent it fresh.    </p>
<p>                    Packed with stories and insights ranging from the team behind Dear Evan Hansen to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin starred chefs, The Creative Curve will help you spend less time on ideas destined to fail and more time on ideas that really break out. This book is for everyone, whether you&#8217;re a business leader, a creative artist or a budding entrepreneur &#8211; and will teach you the secret to conceiving great ideas that can achieve major success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If a country wants to remain economically vibrant, it needs to manufacture things. In recent years, however, many nations have become obsessed with making money out of selling services, leaving the real business of manufacturing to others.    </p>
<p>                    Makers is about how all that is being reversed. Over the past ten years, the internet has democratised publishing, broadcasting and communications, leading to a massive increase in the range of participation in everything digital &#8211; the world of bits. Now the same is happening to manufacturing &#8211; the world of things.    </p>
<p>                    Chris Anderson, bestselling author of The Long Tail, explains how this is happening: how such  technologies as 3D printing and electronics assembly are becoming available to everybody, and how people are building successful businesses as a result. Whereas once every aspiring entrepreneur needed the support of a major manufacturer, now anybody with a smart idea and a little expertise can make their ideas a reality. Just as Google, Facebook and others have created highly successful companies in the virtual world, so these new inventors and manufacturers are assuming positions of ever greater importance in the real world.    </p>
<p>                    The next industrial revolution is on its way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The famed political advisor to Uber, FanDuel, Lemonade, Tesla and other startups reveals what really happens at the intersection of politics, tech and business Most new startups today are in highly regulated industries with strong incumbents &#8211; transportation, hotels, drones, energy, gaming, education, health care, cannabis, finance, liquor, insurance. The more startups try to snatch a piece of the establishment&#8217;s pie, the more they risk running into a political wall. That&#8217;s where Bradley Tusk comes in. Described as Silicon Valley&#8217;s Political Savior (Fast Company) Uber&#8217;s Political Genius (Vanity Fair) and Silicon Valley&#8217;s Favorite Fixer (TechCrunch) Tusk deploys the skills and knowledge he developed working with Chuck Schumer, Michael Bloomberg, Rod Blagojevich, and other political and business legends to help startups fight back. This book goes behind the scenes on how he helped stop the taxi industry from killing Uber in its infancy, how he held insurance companies at bay while startup Lemonade launched in each state, and how he helped online sports betting sites FanDuel and Draft Kings escape the regulatory death grip casinos tried to put on them. As Tusk writes, Every new company is essentially a tech startup. And when you disrupt someone in any industry, they don&#8217;t say thank you. They punch you in the nose. These are the lessons startups need to learn to punch back and survive the clutches of politics. Combining a firsthand glimpse behind the curtain with tangible advice for how any new venture can play the political game, THE FIXER is a must-read for aspiring entrepreneurs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often downplayed in the excitement of starting up a new business venture is one of the most important decisions entrepreneurs will face: should they go it alone, or bring in cofounders, hires, and investors to help build the business? More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin. The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas is the first book to examine the early decisions by entrepreneurs that can make or break a startup and its team. Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas.<br />
                    He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term. The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders. People problems are the leading cause of failure in startups. This book offers solutions.</p>

<p>                    In Beyond Measure, Margaret Heffernan looks back over her decades spent overseeing different organizations and comes to a counterintuitive conclusion: it&#8217;s the small shifts that have the greatest impact. Heffernan argues that building the strongest organization can be accelerated by implementing seemingly small changes, such as embracing conflict as a creative catalyst; using every mind on the team; celebrating mistakes; speaking up and listening more; and encouraging time off from work.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with incredible anecdotes and startling statistics, Beyond Measure takes us on a fascinating tour across the globe, highlighting disparate businesses and revealing how they&#8217;ve managed to change themselves in big ways through incremental shifts. How did the CIA revolutionize their intelligence gathering with one simple question? How did one organization increase their revenue by $15 million by instituting a short coffee break? How can a day-long hackathon change the culture of a company? Told with wry wit and knowing humor, Heffernan proves that it&#8217;s often the small changes that make the greatest, most lasting impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fascinating . . . If you&#8217;re a generalist who has ever felt overshadowed by your specialist colleagues, this book is for you&#8217; &#8211; Bill Gates    </p>
<p>                    The instant Sunday Times Top Ten and New York Times bestseller<br />
                    Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award<br />
                    A Financial Times Essential Reads    </p>
<p>                    A powerful argument for how to succeed in any field: develop broad interests and skills while everyone around you is rushing to specialize.     </p>
<p>                    From the &#8216;10,000 hours rule&#8217; to the power of Tiger parenting, we have been taught that success in any field requires early specialization and many hours of deliberate practice. And, worse, that if you dabble or delay, you&#8217;ll never catch up with those who got a head start.     </p>
<p>                    This is completely wrong.    </p>
<p>                    In this landmark book, David Epstein shows you that the way to succeed is by sampling widely, gaining a breadth of experiences, taking detours, experimenting relentlessly, juggling many interests &#8211; in other words, by developing range.    </p>
<p>                    Studying the world&#8217;s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors and scientists, Epstein demonstrates why in most fields &#8211; especially those that are complex and unpredictable &#8211; generalists, not specialists are primed to excel. No matter what you do, where you are in life, whether you are a teacher, student, scientist, business analyst, parent, job hunter, retiree, you will see the world differently after you&#8217;ve read Range. You&#8217;ll understand better how we solve problems, how we learn and how we succeed. You&#8217;ll see why failing a test is the best way to learn and why frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers.     </p>
<p>                    As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, Range shows how people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive and why spreading your knowledge across multiple domains is the key to your success, and how to achieve it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved Range&#8217; &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.&#8217; &#8211; Daniel H. Pink    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;So much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education.&#8217; &#8211; Susan Cain, bestselling author of Quiet</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book provides evidence-based answers to the key questions asked by marketers every day. Tackling issues such as how brands grow, how advertising really works, what price promotions really do and how loyalty programs really affect loyalty, How Brands Grow presents decades of research in a style that is written for marketing professionals to grow their brands. It is the first book to present these laws in context and to explore their meaning and application.<br />
                    The most distinctive element to this book is that the laws presented are tried and tested; they have been found to hold over varied conditions, time and countries. This is contra to most marketing texts and indeed, much information provides evidence that much modern marketing theory is far from soundly based.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Worth far more than its cover price &#8230; I wish I&#8217;d had it available to me when I was first looking for startup funding&#8217; &#8212; Eric Ries    </p>
<p>                    Every startup needs capital, and ambitious startups seek it on Sand Hill Road &#8211; Silicon Valley&#8217;s dream street for entrepreneurs. That&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find the biggest names in venture capital, including the famed VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, where lawyer-turned-entrepreneur-turned-VC Scott Kupor serves as managing partner.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you&#8217;re trying to get a new company off the ground or scale an existing business to the next level, you need to understand how VCs think. Secrets of Sand Hill Road is the first book that shows you exactly how VCs decide where and how much to invest. It will help you get the best possible deal and make the most of your relationships with VCs. You&#8217;ll learn, for instance:    </p>
<p>                    &#8212; Why most VCs typically invest in only one startup in a given business category<br />
                    &#8212; Why the talent you need most when raising venture capital is your storytelling ability<br />
                    &#8212; How to handle a &#8216;down round&#8217;, when you have to raise funds at a lower valuation than in your previous round<br />
                    &#8212; Why bridge financing (reopening your last round to existing investors) is generally a bad idea<br />
                    &#8212; What to do when VCs get too entangled in the day-to-day operations of your business<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Berkshire Hathaway, the $300 billion conglomerate that Warren Buffett built, is among the world&#8217;s largest and most famous corporations. Yet, for all its power and celebrity, few people understand Berkshire, and many assume it cannot survive without Buffett. This book proves them wrong. In a comprehensive portrait of the corporate culture that unites Berkshire&#8217;s subsidiaries, Lawrence A. Cunningham unearths the traits that assure the conglomerate&#8217;s continued prosperity. Riveting stories of each subsidiary&#8217;s origins, triumphs, and journey to Berkshire reveal how managers generate economic value from intangibles like thrift, integrity, entrepreneurship, autonomy, and a sense of permanence. Rich with lessons for those wishing to profit from the Berkshire model, this engaging book is a valuable read for entrepreneurs, business owners, managers, family business members, and investors, and it is an important resource for scholars of corporate stewardship. General readers will enjoy learning how an iconoclastic businessman transformed a struggling textile company into a corporate legacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the start-up world&#8217;s most in-demand executive coaches-hailed as the &#8220;CEO Whisperer&#8221; (Gimlet Media)-reveals why radical self-inquiry is critical to professional success and healthy relationships in all realms of life.    </p>
<p>                    Jerry Colonna helps start-up CEOs make peace with their demons, the psychological habits and behavioral patterns that have helped them to succeed-molding them into highly accomplished individuals-yet have been detrimental to their relationships and ultimate well-being. Now, this venture capitalist turned executive coach shares his unusual yet highly effective blend of Buddhism, Jungian therapy, and entrepreneurial straight talk to help leaders overcome their own psychological traumas. Reboot is a journey of radical self-inquiry, helping you to reset your life by sorting through the emotional baggage that is holding you back professionally, and even more important, in your relationships.    </p>
<p>                    Jerry has taught CEOs and their top teams to realize their potential by using the raw material of their lives to find meaning, to build healthy interpersonal bonds, and to become more compassionate and bold leaders. In Reboot, he inspires everyone to hold themselves responsible for their choices and for the possibility of truly achieving their dreams.    </p>
<p>                    Work does not have to destroy us. Work can be the way in which we achieve our fullest self, Jerry firmly believes. What we need, sometimes, is a chance to reset our goals and to reconnect with our deepest selves and with each other. Reboot moves and empowers us to begin this journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marijuana legalization is the hottest story in the US today. 22 states have authorized sales in some form; Denver has more legal marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks franchises. We are witnessing the dawn of a new industry. And like the early days of gourmet coffee chains, the rules and players are being established on the fly.     </p>
<p>                    Christian Hageseth is the face of the revolution-an entrepreneur and father of three who worked in the white-collar professional world for 20 years before opening his first dispensary. The Founder and Chairman of Green Man Cannabis, the fastest-growing legalized marijuana company in the country, he&#8217;s the perfect tour guide through the wild frontier, where police hardly know what laws to enforce, or parents what to tell their kids. He paints a colorful picture not only of how he got into the business, but of the big interests that are eager to do the same-namely Philip Morris, Monsanto and a who&#8217;s who of Big Pharma. He predicts a future where the marijuana market splits in two: the high-end, artisanal market, supplied by individual growers and small farms, and the mass market, covered by the cigarette giants and anyone bold enough to compete with them. Much like beer and coffee, your brand of weed will be just one more reflection of your lifestyle. It&#8217;s an entrepreneur&#8217;s dream, and Hageseth invites us along in Big Weed as he pitches skeptical investors, negotiates a shaggy cast of colleagues, and builds the biggest business he can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This third edition of an international bestseller&#8211;over 2 million copies sold worldwide and translated into 33 languages&#8211;details how its powerful insights on motivation, conflict, and collaboration can benefit organizations as well as individuals.     </p>
<p>                    Since its original publication in 2000, Leadership and Self-Deception has become an international word-of-mouth phenomenon. Rather than tapering off, it sells more copies every year. The book&#8217;s central insight&#8211;that the key to leadership lies not in what we do but in who we are&#8211;has proven to have powerful implications not only for organizational leadership but in readers&#8217; personal lives as well.     </p>
<p>                    Leadership and Self-Deception uses an entertaining story everyone can relate to about a man facing challenges at work and at home to expose the fascinating ways that we blind ourselves to our true motivations and unwittingly sabotage the effectiveness of our own efforts to achieve happiness and increase happiness. We trap ourselves in a box of endless self-justification. Most importantly, the book shows us the way out. Readers will discover what millions already have learned&#8211;how to consistently tap into and act on their innate sense of what&#8217;s right, dramatically improving all of their relationships.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Paul&#8217;s meteoric rise took him from a small town in Northern Kentucky to governor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yet he lost it all-his fortune, his reputation, and his job-in one fatal attack of excessive economic hubris. In this honest, frank analysis, Paul and Brendan Moynihan revisit the events that led to Paul&#8217;s disastrous decision and examine the psychological factors behind bad financial practices in several economic sectors.  This book-winner of a 2014 Axiom Business Book award gold medal-begins with the unbroken string of successes that helped Paul achieve a jet-setting lifestyle and land a key spot with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It then describes the circumstances leading up to Paul&#8217;s $1.6 million loss and the essential lessons he learned from it-primarily that, although there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in them, all losses come from the same few sources. Investors lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological barriers preventing the application of analysis.<br />
                    While all analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for instances in which they do not work, psychological factors can keep an investor in a losing position, causing him to abandon one method for another in order to rationalize the decisions already made. Paul and Moynihan&#8217;s cautionary tale includes strategies for avoiding loss tied to a simple framework for understanding, accepting, and dodging the dangers of investing, trading, and speculating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The subject of &#8220;design thinking&#8221; is the rage at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to the work of IDEO, a leading design firm, and its celebrated CEO, Tim Brown, who uses this book to show how the techniques and strategies of design belong at every level of business.    </p>
<p>                    The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design explains design thinking, the collaborative process by which the designer&#8217;s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people&#8217;s needs, not only with what is technically feasible, but what is viable to the bottom line. Design thinking converts need into demand. It&#8217;s a human-centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.     </p>
<p>                    Introduced a decade ago, the concept of design thinking remains popular at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to work of IDEO, the undisputed world leading strategy, innovation, and design firm headed by Tim Brown. As he makes clear in this visionary guide-now updated with addition material, including new case studies, and a new introduction-design thinking is not just applicable to so-called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It&#8217;s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente, to increase the quality of patient care by re-examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change, or Kraft, to rethink supply chain management.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design is not a book by designers for designers; it is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization, product, or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve reinvented my career, my interests, my life, many times over the past twenty years. This is the book I wish I had at the beginning of that long and often volatile journey. I found when I outsourced my self-esteem to only one outcome, disaster resulted. Reinvention was the key to ensuring that the outcomes in life were positive ones. And now the entire world: technology, governments, the shifting landscapes of opportunity and success, are all turning upside down, forcing us to reinvent as individuals and as a culture., Along my own journey I have read and encountered dozens of other successful leaders, artists, entrepreneurs, and mentors who I have learned the art of reinvention from. The journey has been intense. The obstacles were hard fought. And the adventures that led to me now finally sharing it all in this book has been both painful and exhilarating. I describe specific techniques, share stories, tell the stories of others, and give the ultimate guide to not only how but why it is critical for people to master the skills of reinvention. What I&#8217;ve learned: change is the only constant. Companies decay, technologies disappear, governments change, relationships change and opportunity is a shifting landscape. Reading the stories and learning the critical skills taught in Reinvent Yourself is how I found my own way through the chaos of change and onto the path of new opportunity and success. Again, this is the book I wish I had in my hands twenty years ago although I am glad that I am writing it now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stop rushing into businesses born from half-baked ideas, misguided theories, and other forms of self-delusion. A lack of proper validation kills more businesses than anything else. As Joel Barker says, &#8216;Speed is only useful if you re running in the right direction.&#8217; Will It Fly? will help you make sure you are clear for takeoff.    </p>
<p>                     It answers questions like:  Does your business idea have merit? Will it succeed in the market you re trying to serve, or will it just be a waste of time and resources? Is it a good idea for YOU?     </p>
<p>                     In other words, will it fly?    </p>
<p>                     Chock-full of practical suggestions you can apply to your business idea today, Will It Fly? combines action-based exercises, small-scale &#8216;litmus tests&#8217;, and real-world case studies with anecdotes from the author s personal experience of making money online, hosting successful podcasts, testing niche sites, and launching several online businesses.    </p>
<p>                     Will It Fly? will challenge you to think critically, act deliberately, and dare greatly. You can think of the book as your business flight manual, something you can refer to for honest and straight-forward advice as you begin to test your idea and build a business that takes off and soars.    </p>
<p>                     In five parts, Will It Fly? will guide you through the validation of your next business idea:     </p>
<p>                     Part one, Mission Design, helps you make sure your target idea aligns with and supports your goals. Part two, Development Lab, walks you through uncovering important details about your idea that you haven&#8217;t even thought about. Part three, Flight Planning, is all about assessing current market conditions. Part four, Flight Simulator, focuses on the actual validating and testing of an idea with a small segment of a target market. Finally, Part five, All Systems Go, is for final analysis to help you make sure your idea is one you are ready to move forward with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time, Richard Branson.     </p>
<p>                    In little more than twenty-five years, Richard Branson spawned nearly a hundred successful ventures. From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), and others ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none. Many of his companies were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, Don&#8217;t do it. But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent.     </p>
<p>                    In this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Branson has written his own rules for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in his life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories, including:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War     </p>
<p>                    And much more. Losing My Virginity is the ultimate tale of personal and business survival from a man who combines the business prowess of Bill Gates and the promotional instincts of P. T. Barnum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The instant New York Times bestseller from Shark Tank star and Fubu Founder Daymond John on why starting a business on a limited budget can be an entrepreneur&#8217;s greatest competitive advantage. Daymond John has been practicing the power of broke ever since he started selling his home-sewn t-shirts on the streets of Queens. With a $40 budget, Daymond had to strategize out-of-the-box ways to promote his products. Luckily, desperation breeds innovation, and so he hatched an idea for a creative campaign that eventually launched the FUBU brand into a $6 billion dollar global phenomenon. But it might not have happened if he hadn&#8217;t started out broke &#8211; with nothing but hope and a ferocious drive to succeed by any means possible.  Here, the FUBU founder and star of ABC&#8217;s Shark Tank shows that, far from being a liability, broke can actually be your greatest competitive advantage as an entrepreneur. Why? Because starting a business from broke forces you to think more creatively. It forces you to use your resources more efficiently. It forces you to connect with your customers more authentically, and market your ideas more imaginatively. It forces you to be true to yourself, stay laser focused on your goals, and come up with those innovative solutions required to make a meaningful mark. Drawing his own experiences as an entrepreneur and branding consultant, peeks behind-the scenes from the set of Shark Tank, and stories of dozens of other entrepreneurs who have hustled their way to wealth, John shows how we can all leverage the power of broke to phenomenal success. You&#8217;ll meet: &#8211; Steve Aoki, the electronic dance music (EDM) deejay who managed to parlay a series of $100 gigs into becoming a global superstar who has redefined the music industry<br />
                     &#8211; Gigi Butler, a cleaning lady from Nashville who built cupcake empire on the back of a family recipe, her maxed out credit cards, and a heaping dose of faith<br />
                     &#8211; 11-year old Shark Tank guest Mo Bridges who stitched together a winning clothing line with just his grandma&#8217;s sewing machine, a stash of loose fabric, and his unique sartorial flair When your back is up against the wall, your bank account is empty, and creativity and passion are the only resources you can afford, success is your only option. Here you&#8217;ll learn how to tap into that Power of Broke to scrape, hustle, and dream your way to the top.</p>
