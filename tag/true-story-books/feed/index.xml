										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This &#8220;gripping&#8221; New York Times bestseller from the host of CNN podcast Behind the Desk tells the true story-and backstage drama-of late-night comedy (Los Angeles Times).</p>
<p>                     When beloved host Johnny Carson announced his retirement after thirty years on The Tonight Show, millions of Americans mourned. But inside the television industry, the news ignited a battle between two amazing talents-Jay Leno and David Letterman-who both yearned to occupy the departing legend&#8217;s chair. For NBC, it would be a decision with millions of dollars at stake. Soon these two comedians with strikingly different styles, who had once shared a friendship as they worked the clubs together, would be engaged in a fierce competition for the prize.</p>
<p>                     Based on in-depth reporting and interviews with those involved, and updated with a new introduction by the author-a producer of CNN series The Story of Late Night-The Late Shift is a &#8220;vivid, behind-the-scenes, blow-by-blow account&#8221; of the fight that ensued, as stars, agents, and executives maneuvered for control of the most profitable program in TV history (Chicago Tribune).</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Remarkably gripping . . . Takes us deep into the bizarre high-stakes world of broadcasting . . . A powerful story, and ultimately a sad one, filled with casualties as well as winners.&#8221; -The New York Times Book Review</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Solid reporting, based on extensive interviews with the principals, lifts The Late Shift into a class of its own. . . . The insights into the people involved are what make [the book] a page-turner.&#8221; -Orange Country Register</p>

<p>                    On 5 October 2017, the New York Times published an article by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey that helped change the world.    </p>
<p>                    Hollywood was talking as never before. Kantor and Twohey outmanoeuvred Harvey Weinstein, his team of defenders and private investigators, convincing some of the most famous women in the world &#8211; and some unknown ones &#8211; to go on the record. Three years later, it helped lead to his conviction.    </p>
<p>                    This is how they did it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, one of the giants of modern journalism fell: Gawker Media, infamous for saying what other outlets wouldn&#8217;t say, was sued for publishing Hulk Hogan&#8217;s sex tape, lost the case and went bust. After countless other lawsuits it seemed that Gawker had finally run out of luck. But luck had nothing to do with it.     </p>
<p>                    Peter Thiel, PayPal founder and billionaire investor, had masterminded the whole thing. Still furious at an article that had outed him ten years previously, and increasingly disgusted at Gawker&#8217;s unscrupulous reporting methods, Thiel had spent nearly a decade meticulously plotting a conspiracy that would lead to the demise of Gawker and its founder, Nick Denton. After a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, the settlement of $140million in favour of Hogan ended it.    </p>
<p>                    The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter&#8217;s ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean&#8211;for free speech? For privacy? For culture?    </p>
<p>                    In Holiday&#8217;s masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by exclusive interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press. It&#8217;s a study in power, strategy, and one of the most wildly ambitious &#8211; and successful &#8211; secret plots in recent memory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International No. 1 Bestseller<br />
                    A BBC 2 Between the Covers Book Club Pick    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Cuts to the heart of who we are&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                    &#8216;A book that begs discussion&#8217; Vanity Fair    </p>
<p>                    All Lina wanted was to be desired. How did she end up in a marriage with two children and a husband who wouldn&#8217;t touch her?    </p>
<p>                    All Maggie wanted was to be understood. How did she end up in a relationship with her teacher and then in court, a hated pariah in her small town?    </p>
<p>                    All Sloane wanted was to be admired. How did she end up a sexual object of men, including her husband, who liked to watch her have sex with other men and women?    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I will probably re-read it every year of my life&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Will have millions nodding in recognition&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As gripping as the most gripping thriller&#8217; Marian Keyes    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;When I picked it up, I felt I&#8217;d been waiting half my life to read it&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The kind of bold, timely, once-in-a-generation book that every house should have a copy of, and probably will before too long&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    The book Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alexa Chung, Jodie Comer, Reese Witherspoon, Harry Styles, Fearne Cotton, Caitriona Balfe, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sharon Horgan, Zoe Ball, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Davina McCall, Gemma Chan, Christine and the Queens and Gillian Anderson are all reading</p>
