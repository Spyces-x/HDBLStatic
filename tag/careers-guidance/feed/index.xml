										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change your life in 2021 with the simple, scientifically proven method that has already worked for thousands of people.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Life has questions. They have answers&#8217; New York Times    </p>
<p>                     At last, a book that shows you how to build &#8211; design &#8211; a life you can thrive in, at any age or stage. A well-designed life means a life well-lived. Many of us are still looking for an answer to that perennial question, &#8216;What do I want to be when I grow up?&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     Stanford innovators Bill Burnett and Dave Evans show us how design thinking can help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who and where we are, our careers and our age. Designing Your Life puts forward the idea that the same design thinking responsible for amazing technology, products and spaces can be used to build towards a better life and career by a design of your own making.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;[Designing Your Life] teaches you how to change what&#8217;s not working by turning ideas on their head&#8217; Viv Groskop, author of How To Own The Room    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;An empowering book based on their popular class of the same name at Stanford University&#8230;this book will easily earn a place among career-finding classics&#8217; Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do What You Are &#8212; the bestselling classic that has helped more than a million people find truly satisfying work &#8212; is now updated for the modern workforce. With the global economy&#8217;s ups and downs, the advent of astonishing new technology, the migration to online work and study, and the ascendancy of mobile communication, so much has changed in the American workplace since this book&#8217;s fifth edition was published in 2014.    </p>
<p>                    What hasn&#8217;t changed is the power of Personality Type to help people achieve job satisfaction. This updated edition, featuring 30% new material, is especially useful for millennials and for baby boomers experiencing midlife career switches, and even those looking for fulfillment in retirement. The book leads readers step-by-step through the process of determining and verifying Personality Type. Then it identifies occupations that are popular with each Type, provides helpful case studies, and offers a rundown of each Type&#8217;s work-related strengths and weaknesses.    </p>
<p>                    Focusing on each Type&#8217;s strengths, Do What You Are uses workbook exercises to help you customize your job search, get the most out of your current career, obtain leadership positions, and ensure that you achieve the best results in the shortest period of time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times bestselling author, a provocative book of hard-won wisdom for achieving a  fulfilling career and life.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; How can you have a meaningful career, not just a lucrative one?<br />
                    &#8211; Is a work/life balance really possible?<br />
                    &#8211; What does it take to make a long-term relationship succeed?<br />
                    &#8211; What can you do now so there are no regrets aged 40, 50 or 80?    </p>
<p>                                   As Scott Galloway puts it, by the time you hit your mid twenties sh*t gets real. Life become stressful. Even the smart, the hard working and the elite can feel lost in a chaotic, noisy and unpredictable world. As a professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of Business, the debate in Galloway&#8217;s MBA class often veers away from business strategy to the challenging issue of life strategies. Which is why Galloway, in his signature, take-no-prisoners style, has developed a dynamic formula for a life well lived.    </p>
<p>                     In The Algebra of Happiness Galloway tells you how life can be navigated and negotiated better to maximise happiness and minimise the inevitable stress. Delivering practical advice and hard-won wisdom on everything from when to own property to how hard to work, this is self-help for anyone struggling with life&#8217;s big questions. Through simple equations that measure the relationship between success, resilience and failure or the correlation between happiness and money, Galloway attempts to convert intangible advice to tangible equations.</p>

<p>                    How do you make your start-up a genuine success in the long term?

It will give you all the insights you need to build and optimize your team, improve your product and develop your own capacity to lead covering:<br />
                    *         Coping with uncertainty and conflict<br />
                    *         Playing the long game<br />
                    *         Optimising your team<br />
                    *         Problem solving through the ups and downs<br />
                    *         Adapting your strategy<br />
                    *         When to quit<br />
                    Building on seven years&#8217; of meticulous research with entrepreneurs, small agencies, start-ups and billion-dollar companies, Scott Belsky offers indispensable lessons on how to endure and thrive in the long term.</p>

<p>                    If you&#8217;re enjoying the status quo, don&#8217;t even consider reading this book.    </p>

<p>                    Why has Poke the Box become a cult classic?    </p>
<p>                    Because it&#8217;s a book that dares readers to do something they&#8217;re afraid of.    </p>
<p>                    It could be what you need, too.    </p>

                    &#8216;Bruce Daisley is on a mission to change the world of work.&#8217; The Times<br />
                    __________________________    </p>
<p>                    From the creator of hit podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat comes a revolutionary re-envisioning of how to enjoy your job.    </p>
<p>                    Do you want to get more done, feel less stressed and love your job again?    </p>
<p>                    Sometimes having a job can feel like hard work. But between Monk Mode mornings, silent meetings and crisp Thursdays, the solutions are at your fingertips.    </p>
<p>                    Bruce Daisley knows a thing or two about the workplace. In the course of a career that has taken him from some of the world&#8217;s biggest media companies to Twitter, via Google and YouTube, he has become a leading expert on how we work now. And in his hugely popular podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat, he has explored ways to fix it. Now he shares 30 brilliant &#8211; and refreshingly simple &#8211; tips on how to make your job more productive, more rewarding &#8211; and much, much more enjoyable.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;With just 30 changes, you can transform your work experience from bland and boring (or worse) to fulfilling, fun, and even joyful.&#8217; Daniel Pink, author of When and Drive    </p>
<p>                    __________________________    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;This is a warm, wise and funny book which provides a terrific summary of some of the science &#8211; and stories &#8211; behind what makes work a positive part of people&#8217;s lives. From the importance of lunch to the value of laughter, this book gives witty and practical advice. I loved it and I&#8217;ve already started changing some of the things I do at work, as a result!&#8221; &#8211; Professor Sophie Scott    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Don&#8217;t quit yet! In this book, Bruce shares remarkable advice that may well have you laughing while you work and truly loving your job.&#8221; &#8211; Biz Stone, Twitter co-founder    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Bruce Daisley&#8217;s The Joy of Work is a joy to read. It translates the best of workplace psychology research into practical ways of establishing creative and liveable cultures at work-a must read for all of us 9-5ers!&#8221; &#8211; Professor Sir Cary Cooper, ALLIANCE Manchester Business School, University of Manchester    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Bruce&#8217;s The Joy of Work is an important reminder of simple everyday practices to improve how we all work together, which will lead to greater team and individual happiness and performance. Great results will follow.&#8221; &#8211; Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;With just 30 changes, you can transform your work experience from bland and boring (or worse) to fulfilling, fun, and even joyful. Bruce Daisley has pulled together threads of research and woven them into a tapestry of strategies that actually work, and that don&#8217;t depend on the CEO&#8217;s sign-off for implementation. You can begin changing your work culture today at the individual, team, and organisational levels with these tactics that increase creativity, productivity, and satisfaction.&#8221; &#8211; Daniel Pink, author of WHEN and DRIVE</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A researcher and consultant burrows deep inside the heads of one modern two-career couple to examine how each partner processes the workday-revealing how a more nuanced understanding of the brain can allow us to better organize, prioritize, recall, and sort our daily lives.    </p>
<p>                    Emily and Paul are the parents of two young children, and professionals with different careers. Emily is the newly promoted vice president of marketing at a large corporation; Paul works from home or from clients&#8217; offices as an independent IT consultant. Their days are filled with a bewildering blizzard of emails, phone calls, more emails, meetings, projects, proposals, and plans. Just staying ahead of the storm has become a seemingly insurmountable task.    </p>
<p>                    In Your Brain at Work, Dr. David Rock goes inside Emily and Paul&#8217;s brains to see how they function as each attempts to sort, prioritize, organize, and act on the vast quantities of information they receive in one typical day. Dr. Rock is an expert on how the brain functions in a work setting. By analyzing what is going on in their heads, he offers solutions Emily and Paul (and all of us) can use to survive and thrive in today&#8217;s hyperbusy work environment-and still feel energized and accomplished at the end of the day.    </p>
<p>                    In Your Brain at Work, Dr. Rock explores issues such as:    </p>
<p>                    why our brains feel so taxed, and how to maximize our mental resources<br />
                    why it&#8217;s so hard to focus, and how to better manage distractions<br />
                    how to maximize the chance of finding insights to solve seemingly insurmountable problems<br />
                    how to keep your cool in any situation, so that you can make the best decisions possible<br />
                    how to collaborate more effectively with others<br />
                    why providing feedback is so difficult, and how to make it easier<br />
                    how to be more effective at changing other people&#8217;s behavior<br />
                    and much more.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;A guide for people who want a career change but are too scared to really go for it&#8217; Elle    </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s always the right time to think about your next move.    </p>
