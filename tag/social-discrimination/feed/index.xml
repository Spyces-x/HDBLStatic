										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To this day, churchgoing Mormons report that they hear from their fellow congregants in Sunday meetings that African-Americans are the accursed descendants of Cain whose spirits-due to their lack of spiritual mettle in a premortal existence-were destined to come to earth with a &#8220;curse&#8221; of black skin. This claim can be made in many Mormon Sunday Schools without fear of contradiction. You are more likely to encounter opposition if you argue that the ban on the<br />
                    ordination of Black Mormons was a product of human racism. Like most difficult subjects in Mormon history and practice, says Joanna Brooks, the priesthood and temple ban on Blacks has been managed carefully in LDS institutional settings with a combination of avoidance, denial, selective truth-telling, and<br />
                    determined silence.<br />
                    As America begins to come to terms with the costs of white privilege to Black lives, this book urges a soul-searching examination of the role American Christianity has played in sustaining everyday white supremacy by assuring white people of their innocence. In Mormonism and White Supremacy, Joanna Brooks offers an unflinching look at her own people&#8217;s history and culture and finds in them lessons that will hit home for every scholar of American religion and person of faith.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This explosive new book challenges many of the long-prevailing assumptions about blacks, about Jews, about Germans, about slavery, and about education. Plainly written, powerfully reasoned, and backed with a startling array of documented facts, Black Rednecks and White Liberals takes on not only the trendy intellectuals of our times but also such historic interpreters of American life as Alexis de Tocqueville and Frederick Law Olmsted. In a series of long essays, this book presents an in-depth look at key beliefs behind many mistaken and dangerous actions, policies, and trends. It presents eye-opening insights into the historical development of the ghetto culture that is today wrongly seen as a unique black identity&#8211;a culture cheered on toward self-destruction by white liberals who consider themselves &#8220;friends&#8221; of blacks. An essay titled &#8220;The Real History of Slavery&#8221; presents a jolting re-examination of that tragic institution and the narrow and distorted way it is too often seen today. The reasons for the venomous hatred of Jews, and of other groups like them in countries around the world, are explored in an essay that asks, &#8220;Are Jews Generic?&#8221;<br />
                    Misconceptions of German history in general, and of the Nazi era in particular, are also re-examined. So too are the inspiring achievements and painful tragedies of black education in the United States. &#8220;Black Rednecks and White Liberals&#8221; is the capstone of decades of outstanding research and writing on racial and cultural issues by Thomas Sowell.    </p>

With magisterial learning and the elan of a born storyteller, Pagels turns Satan&#8217;s story into an audacious exploration of Christianity&#8217;s shadow side, in which the gospel of love gives way to irrational hatreds that continue to haunt Christians and non-Christians alike.    </p>

<p>                    Discrimination and Disparities gathers a wide array of empirical evidence to challenge the idea that different economic outcomes can be explained by any one factor, be it discrimination, exploitation, or genetics. This revised and enlarged edition also analyzes the human consequences of the prevailing social vision of these disparities and the policies based on that vision&#8211;from educational disasters to widespread crime and violence.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Superb, hugely enjoyable &#8230; a spirited examination of the hubris and  hypocrisy of the super-rich who claim they are helping the world&#8217; Aditya  Chakrabortty, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    What explains the spreading backlash against the global elite? In this revelatory investigation, Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, showing how the elite follow a &#8216;win-win&#8217; logic, fighting for equality and justice any way they can &#8211; except ways that threaten their position at the top.     </p>
<p>                    But why should our gravest problems be solved by consultancies, technology companies and corporate-sponsored charities instead of public institutions and elected officials? Why should we rely on scraps from the winners? Trenchant and gripping, this is an indispensable guide and call to action for elites and citizens alike.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Finally: an engaging, evidence-based book about how to battle biases, champion diversity and inclusion, and advocate for those who lack power and privilege. Dolly Chugh makes a convincing case that being an ally isn&#8217;t about being a good person-it&#8217;s about constantly striving to be a better person.&#8221;  -Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take, Originals, and Option B with Sheryl Sandberg    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Laszlo Bock, the bestselling author of Work Rules! and former Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google    </p>
<p>                    An inspiring guide from Dolly Chugh, an award-winning social psychologist at the New York University Stern School of Business, on how to confront difficult issues including sexism, racism, inequality, and injustice so that you can make the world (and yourself) better.    </p>
<p>                    Many of us believe in equality, diversity, and inclusion. But how do we stand up for those values in our turbulent world? The Person You Mean to Be is the smart, &#8220;semi-bold&#8221; person&#8217;s guide to fighting for what you believe in.    </p>
<p>                    Dolly reveals the surprising causes of inequality, grounded in the &#8220;psychology of good people&#8221;. Using her research findings in unconscious bias as well as work across psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and other disciplines, she offers practical tools to respectfully and effectively talk politics with family, to be a better colleague to people who don&#8217;t look like you, and to avoid being a well-intentioned barrier to equality. Being the person we mean to be starts with a look at ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    She argues that the only way to be on the right side of history is to be a good-ish- rather than good-person. Good-ish people are always growing. Second, she helps you find your &#8220;ordinary privilege&#8221;-the part of your everyday identity you take for granted, such as race for a white person, sexual orientation for a straight person, gender for a man, or education for a college graduate. This part of your identity may bring blind spots, but it is your best tool for influencing change. Third, Dolly introduces the psychological reasons that make it hard for us to see the bias in and around us. She leads you from willful ignorance to willful awareness. Finally, she guides you on how, when, and whom, to engage (and not engage) in your workplaces, homes, and communities. Her science-based approach is a method any of us can put to use in all parts of our life.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you are a long-time activist or new to the fight, you can start from where you are. Through the compelling stories Dolly shares and the surprising science she reports, Dolly guides each of us closer to being the person we mean to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WINNER OF BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD 2021 AND BEST START UP/SCALE UP BOOK AWARD 2021    </p>
<p>                    This ground-breaking book exposes the myths behind startup success, illuminates the real forces at work and shows how they can be harnessed in your favour.    </p>
<p>                    The world isn&#8217;t a level playing field. Meritocracy is a myth. And if you look at those at the top, you realise that behind every success story is an Unfair Advantage. But that doesn&#8217;t just mean your parents&#8217; wealth or who you know. An Unfair Advantage is any element that gives you an edge over your competition. And we all have one.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on over two decades of hands-on experience, including as the first Marketing Director of Just Eat (a startup now worth over GBP5 billion), the authors show how to identify your own unfair advantages and apply them to any project. Hard work and grit aren&#8217;t enough, so they explore the importance of money, intelligence, insight, location, education, expertise, status and luck in the journey to success. From Snapchat to Spanx, Oprah to Elon Musk, unfair advantages have shaped the journeys of some of the most successful brands in the world. This book helps you too find the external circumstances and internal strengths to succeed in the world of business and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT is an empowering letter from former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri to the first woman president, and by extension, to all women working to succeed in any field.     </p>
<p>                    By using lessons learned during her experiences with Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and Elizabeth Edwards &#8211; to name a few &#8211; Palmieri through each chapter creates a forward-thinking framework of inspirational and practical advice for all women everywhere &#8211; from boardrooms to living rooms &#8211; who are determined to seize control of their lives, their workplaces, and their country. DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT will turn the results of the 2016 election into something incredibly empowering for future female leaders and independent thinkers everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    We haven&#8217;t wrapped our heads around what it should look like for a woman to be in the job of President. Our only models are men. This of course was seen during the Hillary Clinton campaign, and no one knows this better than Jennifer Palmieri. While wildly disappointed by the outcome of the election, Palmieri optimistically argues in the book that the Clinton candidacy and all she experienced on the campaign trail &#8211; confusion, admiration, hate, love, acceptance, rejection &#8211; can now open the country up to reimagining women in leadership roles. And that is what Palmieri takes on in this book &#8211; redefining expectations for women looking to lead and creating a blueprint for women candidates and leaders to follow.</p>

<p>                    WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ZOE WILLIAMS     </p>
<p>                    The term feminism did not yet exist when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote this book, but it was the first great piece of feminist writing. In these pages you will find the essence of her argument &#8211; for the education of women and for an increased female contribution to society. Her work made the first ripples of what would later become the tidal wave of the women&#8217;s rights movement. Rationalist but revolutionary, Wollstonecraft changed the world for women.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;With clarity and compassion,  DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as  a practice not restricted to  &#8220;bad people.&#8221; In doing so, she moves our  national discussions forward.  This is a necessary book for all people  invested in societal change&#8217;  Claudia Rankine    </p>
<p>                    Anger. Fear. Guilt. Denial. Silence. These  are the ways in which  ordinary white people react when it is pointed  out to them that they  have done or said something that has &#8211;  unintentionally &#8211; caused racial  offence or hurt. After, all, a racist  is the worst thing a person can  be, right? But these reactions only  serve to silence people of colour,  who cannot give honest feedback to  &#8216;liberal&#8217; white people lest they  provoke a dangerous emotional  reaction.     </p>
<p>                    Robin DiAngelo coined  the term &#8216;White Fragility&#8217; in  2011 to describe this process and is here  to show us how it serves to  uphold the system of white supremacy. Using  knowledge and insight  gained over decades of running racial awareness  workshops and working  on this idea as a Professor of Whiteness Studies,  she shows us how we  can start having more honest conversations, listen  to each other better  and react to feedback with grace and humility. It  is not enough to  simply hold abstract progressive views and condemn the  obvious racists  on social media &#8211; change starts with us all at a  practical, granular  level, and it is time for all white people to take  responsibility for  relinquishing their own racial supremacy.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;By turns mordant  and  then inspirational, an argument that powerful  forces and tragic   histories stack the deck fully against racial justice  alongside one  that  we need only to be clearer, try harder, and do  better&#8217; David  Roediger, Los Angeles Review of Books    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The value in White Fragility    lies in its methodical, irrefutable exposure of racism in thought and    action, and its call for humility and vigilance&#8217; Katy Waldman, New Yorker    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times Notable Book of 2016<br />
                    Winner of the Zócalo Public Square Book Prize     </p>
<p>                    On March 29, 1516, the city council of Venice issued a decree forcing Jews to live in il geto&#8211;a closed quarter named for the copper foundry that once occupied the area. The term stuck.     </p>
<p>                    In this sweeping and original account, Mitchell Duneier traces the idea of the ghetto from its beginnings in the sixteenth century and its revival by the Nazis to the present. As Duneier shows, we cannot comprehend the entanglements of race, poverty, and place in America today without recalling the ghettos of Europe, as well as earlier efforts to understand the problems of the American city.     </p>
<p>                    Ghetto is the story of the scholars and activists who tried to achieve that understanding. As Duneier shows, their efforts to wrestle with race and poverty cannot be divorced from their individual biographies, which often included direct encounters with prejudice and discrimination in the academy and elsewhere. Using new and forgotten sources, Duneier introduces us to Horace Cayton and St. Clair Drake, graduate students whose conception of the South Side of Chicago established a new paradigm for thinking about Northern racism and poverty in the 1940s. We learn how the psychologist Kenneth Clark subsequently linked Harlem&#8217;s slum conditions with the persistence of black powerlessness, and we follow the controversy over Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#8217;s report on the black family. We see how the sociologist William Julius Wilson redefined the debate about urban America as middle-class African Americans increasingly escaped the ghetto and the country retreated from racially specific remedies. And we trace the education reformer Geoffrey Canada&#8217;s efforts to transform the lives of inner-city children with ambitious interventions, even as other reformers sought to help families escape their neighborhoods altogether.     </p>
<p>                    Duneier offers a clear-eyed assessment of the thinkers and doers who have shaped American ideas about urban poverty&#8211;and the ghetto. The result is a valuable new estimation of an age-old concept.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An indispensable resource for  white people who want to challenge white supremacy but don&#8217;t know where  to begin&#8217; Robin DiAngelo, author of New York Times bestseller WHITE FRAGILITY    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It should be mandatory reading &#8230; Buy the book, do the work and then push more copies into the hands of everyone you know&#8217; Emma Gannon    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Confrontational and much-needed&#8217; Stylist    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;She is no-joke changing the world and, for what it&#8217;s worth, the way I live my life.&#8217;<br />
                    Anne Hathaway    </p>
<p>                    ___________    </p>
<p>                    Me and White Supremacy shows readers how to dismantle the privilege within themselves so that they can stop (often unconsciously) inflicting damage on people of colour, and in turn, help other white people do better, too.    </p>
<p>                    When Layla Saad began an Instagram challenge called #MeAndWhiteSupremacy, she never predicted it would spread as widely as it did. She encouraged people to own up and share their racist behaviours, big and small. She was looking for truth, and she got it. Thousands of people participated, and over 90,000 people downloaded the book.    </p>
<p>                    The updated and expanded Me and White Supremacy takes the work deeper by adding more historical and cultural contexts, sharing moving stories and anecdotes, and including expanded definitions, examples, and further resources.    </p>
<p>                    Awareness leads to action, and action leads to change. The numbers show that readers are ready to do this work &#8211; let&#8217;s give it to them.</p>

<p>                    NOT BEING RACIST IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO BE ANTIRACIST.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Transformative and revolutionary&#8217; ROBIN DIANGELO, author of White Fragility    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;So vital&#8217; IJEOMA OLUO, author of So You Want to Talk About Race    </p>
<p>                     In this rousing and deeply empathetic book, Ibram X. Kendi, one of the world&#8217;s most influential scholars of racism, shows that neutrality is not an option: until we become part of the solution, we can only be part of the problem.    </p>
<p>                     Using his extraordinary gifts as a teacher and story-teller, Kendi helps us recognise that everyone is, at times, complicit in racism whether they realise it or not, and by describing with moving humility his own journey from racism to antiracism, he shows us how instead to be a force for good. Along the way, Kendi punctures all the myths and taboos that so often cloud our understanding, from arguments about what race is and whether racial differences exist to the complications that arise when race intersects with ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality.    </p>
<p>                     In the process he demolishes the myth of the post-racial society and builds from the ground up a vital new understanding of racism &#8211; what it is, where it is hidden, how to identify it and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The most courageous book to date on the problem of race&#8217; New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It feels like a light switch being flicked on&#8217; OWEN JONES</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction    </p>
<p>                    Longlisted for the National Book Award    </p>
<p>                    One of the New York Times Book Review&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2017    </p>
<p>                    Former public defender James Forman, Jr. is a leading critic of mass incarceration and its disproportionate impact on people of colour. In LOCKING UP OWN OWN, he seeks to understand the war on crime that began in the 1970s and why it was supported by many African American leaders in the nation&#8217;s urban centres.    </p>
<p>                    Forman shows us that the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges and police chiefs took office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction. Many prominent black officials, including Washington, DC mayor Marion Barry and federal prosecutor Eric Holder, feared that the gains of the civil rights movement were being undermined by lawlessness &#8211; and thus embraced tough-on-crime measures, including longer sentences and aggressive police tactics. In the face of skyrocketing murder rates and the proliferation of open-air drug markets, they believed they had no choice. But the policies they adopted would have devastating consequences for residents of poor black neighbourhoods.    </p>
<p>                    A former public defender, Forman tells riveting stories of politicians, community activists, police officers, defendants and crime victims. He writes with compassion about individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas &#8211; from the men and women he represented in court to officials struggling to respond to a public safety emergency.LOCKING UP OWN OWN enriches our understanding of why American society became so punitive and offers important lessons to anyone concerned about the future of race and the criminal justice system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;necessary and incisive&#8221; (Roxane Gay) account of the discrimination case that &#8220;has blown open a conversation about the status of women&#8221; in the workplace (The New York Times) SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR &#8211; NAMED A BEST FALL BOOK BY ELLE AND BUSTLE  In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world&#8211;and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support&#8211;Time hailed her as &#8220;the face of change.&#8221; Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset,  she tells her full story for the first time.  The daughter of immigrants, Pao was taught that through hard work she could achieve her dreams. She earned multiple Ivy League degrees, worked at top startups, and in 2005 was recruited by Kleiner Perkins, arguably the world&#8217;s leading venture capital firm at the time. In many ways, she did everything right, and yet she and other women and people of color were excluded from success&#8211;cut out of decisive meetings and email discussions, uninvited to CEO dinners and lavish networking trips, and had their work undercut or appropriated by male executives. It was time for a system reset.  After Kleiner, Pao became CEO of reddit, where she took forceful action to change the status quo for the company and its product. She banned revenge porn and unauthorized nude photos&#8211;an action other large media sites later followed&#8211;and shut down parts of reddit over online harassment. She and seven other women tech leaders formed Project Include, an award-winning nonprofit for accelerating diversity and inclusion in tech. In her book, Pao shines a light on troubling issues that plague today&#8217;s workplace and lays out practical, inspiring, and achievable goals for a better future.  Ellen K. Pao&#8217;s Reset is a rallying cry&#8211;the story of a whistleblower who aims to empower everyone struggling to be heard, in Silicon Valley and beyond. Praise for Reset &#8220;Necessary and incisive . . . As Ellen Pao detailed her experiences, while also communicating her passion for the work men often impeded her from doing, I was nothing short of infuriated. It was great to see a highly accomplished woman of color speaking out like this, and hopefully this book will encourage more women to come forward, give voice to their experiences in the workplace, and contribute to meaningful change.&#8221;&#8211;Roxane Gay</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to read&#8230;This Will Be My Undoing.&#8221;-Roxane Gay     </p>
<p>                    One of the sharpest, fiercest, and most eloquent critics writing right now, Morgan Jerkins&#8217;s byline has appeared around the Internet for The New Yorker&#8217;s Page-Turner, Vogue, the New York Times, the Atlantic, Buzzfeed, and more; in this highly anticipated collection of linked essays perfect for fans of Bad Feminist, Rebecca Solnit&#8217;s Men Explain Things to Me, and Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie&#8217;s We Should All Be Feminists, Jerkins interweaves the incisive commentary on pop culture, feminism, black history, misogyny, and racism that she&#8217;s known for with her own experiences to confront the very real challenges of being a black woman today.    </p>
<p>                              &#8220;Growing up as a black woman is different. It prepares you to remember that you have to navigate two worlds. In this predominantly white, male-dominated world, you will never be white or male. Within the black community, belonging to the world of black women demands strength, wit, and aggression, because space for and by ourselves is small. You either assert yourself or learn to do so through humiliation, a constant shedding of respectability necessary to expose who you really are: just another black girl fighting to exist.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                              Morgan Jerkins is only in her twenties, but she has already established herself as an insightful, brutally honest writer who isn&#8217;t afraid of tackling tough, controversial subjects. In This Will Be My Undoing, she takes on perhaps one of the most provocative contemporary topics: What does it mean to &#8220;be&#8221;-to live as, to exist as-a black woman today? This is a book about black women, but it&#8217;s necessary reading for all Americans.     </p>
<p>                              Doubly disenfranchised by race and gender, often deprived of a place within the mostly white mainstream feminist movement, black women are objectified, silenced, and marginalized with devastating consequences, in ways both obvious and subtle, that are rarely acknowledged in our country&#8217;s larger discussion about inequality. In This Will Be My Undoing, Jerkins becomes both narrator and subject to expose the social, cultural, and historical story of black female oppression that influences the black community as well the white, male-dominated world at large.     </p>
<p>                              Whether she&#8217;s writing about Sailor Moon; Rachel Dolezal; the stigma of therapy; her complex relationship with her own physical body; the pain of dating when men say they don&#8217;t &#8220;see color&#8221;; being a black visitor in Russia; the specter of &#8220;the fast-tailed girl&#8221; and the paradox of black female sexuality; or disabled black women in the context of the &#8220;Black Girl Magic&#8221; movement, Jerkins is concise, compelling, and often revelatory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Caitlin Moran&#8217;s How To Be A Womanis the fun-filled manual for female survival in the 21st century, everyday sexism is its more politicised sister&#8217; (Independent on Sunday).    </p>
<p>                    After experiencing a series of escalating sexist incidents, Laura Bates started theeveryday sexism projectand has gone on to write &#8216;a pioneering analysis of modern day misogyny&#8217; (Telegraph).    </p>
<p>                    After an astounding response from the wide range of stories that came pouring in from all over the world, the project quickly became one of the biggest social media success stories of the internet.     </p>
<p>                    From being harassed and wolf-whistled at on the street, to discrimination in the workplace and serious sexual assault, it is clear that sexism had become normalised. But Bates inspires women to lead a real change and writes this &#8216;extremely powerful book that could, and should, win hearts and minds right across the spectrum&#8217; (Financial Times).     </p>
<p>                    Often shocking, sometimes amusing and always poignant, everyday sexism is a protest against inequality and a manifesto for change. It&#8217;s &#8216;a game-changing book, a must-read for every woman&#8217; (Cosmopolitan).    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Admirable and culturally transferable. &#8220;A storm is coming,&#8221; writes Bates. After reading this book you&#8217;ll hope so&#8217; (Independent).Welcome to the fourth wave of feminism.</p>

<p>                    New York Times Bestseller &#8211; Finalist for the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize     </p>
<p>                     Named One of the Best Books of the Year by The New York Times &#8211; USA Today &#8211; Time &#8211; Los Angeles Times &#8211; San Francisco Chronicle &#8211; Essence &#8211; O: The Oprah Magazine &#8211; The Week &#8211; Kirkus Reviews     </p>
<p>                     *Kirkus Reviews (starred review)    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;We were eight years in power&#8221; was the lament of Reconstruction-era black politicians as the American experiment in multiracial democracy ended with the return of white supremacist rule in the South. In this sweeping collection of new and selected essays, Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America&#8217;s &#8220;first white president.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period&#8211;and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation&#8217;s old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective&#8211;the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president.     </p>
<p>                     We Were Eight Years in Power features Coates&#8217;s iconic essays first published in The Atlantic,  including &#8220;Fear of a Black President,&#8221; &#8220;The Case for Reparations,&#8221; and &#8220;The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration,&#8221; along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates&#8217;s own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. We Were Eight Years in Power is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment.</p>

In this stirring and insightful analysis, activist and scholar Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor surveys the historical and contemporary ravages of racism and argues that the persistence of structural problems such as mass incarceration and Black unemployment have created a context in which this new struggle against police violence holds the potential to reignite a broader push for Black liberation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Oprah&#8217;s Book Club Summer 2018 Selection     </p>
<p>                    The Instant New York Times Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    A powerful, revealing story of hope, love, justice, and the power of reading by a man who spent thirty years on death row for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An amazing and heartwarming story, it restores our faith in the inherent goodness of humanity.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Archbishop Desmond Tutu     </p>
<p>                     In 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free.     </p>
<p>                     But with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence&#8211;full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon&#8211;transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.     </p>
<p>                     With a foreword by Stevenson,  The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times. Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hinton&#8217;s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a man&#8217;s freedom, but you can&#8217;t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* Longlisted for the National Book Award * Winner of the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award * A New York Times Notable Book * A Washington Post Notable Book * An NPR Best Book of 2017 * A Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2017 * An Atlanta Journal-Constitution Best Southern Book of 2017 *    </p>
<p>                     This extraordinary New York Times bestseller reexamines a pivotal event of the civil rights movement-the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till-&#8220;and demands that we do the one vital thing we aren&#8217;t often enough asked to do with history: learn from it&#8221; (The Atlantic).    </p>
<p>                    In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves &#8220;the Emmett Till generation&#8221; launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till&#8217;s lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history.    </p>
<p>                    But what actually happened to Emmett Till-not the icon of injustice, but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, The Blood of Emmett Till &#8220;unfolds like a movie&#8221; (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution), drawing on a wealth of new evidence, including a shocking admission of Till&#8217;s innocence from the woman in whose name he was killed. &#8220;Jolting and powerful&#8221; (The Washington Post), the book &#8220;provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions&#8221; (Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Carry Me Home) and &#8220;calls us to the cause of justice today&#8221; (Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, president of the North Carolina NAACP).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Makes for compelling reading in America today.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I want to try and understand why so many people commit crimes in the name of identity,&#8221; writes Amin Maalouf. Identity is the crucible out of which we come: our background, our race, our gender, our tribal affiliations, our religion (or lack thereof), all go into making up who we are. All too often, however, the notion of identity&#8211;personal, religious, ethnic, or national&#8211;has given rise to heated passions and even massive crimes.     </p>
<p>                    Moving across the world&#8217;s history, faiths, and politics, he argues against an oversimplified and hostile interpretation of the concept. He cogently and persuasively examines identity in the context of the modern world, where it can be viewed as both glory and poison. Evident here are the dangers of using identity as a protective&#8211;and therefore aggressive&#8211;mechanism, the root of racial, geographical, and colonialist subjugation throughout history.     </p>
<p>                    Maalouf contends that many of us would reject our inherited conceptions of identity, to which we cling through habit, if only we examined them more closely. The future of society depends on accepting all identities, while recognizing our individualism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic New York Times bestseller that &#8216;struck the spark that would eventually light the fire of Black Lives Matter&#8217; (Ibram X. Kendi)    </p>
<p>                    Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by Entertainment Weekly&#8217; Slate&#8217; Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217; Literary Hub and Book Riot    </p>
<p>                    Once in a great while a book comes along that radically changes our understanding of a crucial political issue and helps to fuel a social movement. The New Jim Crow is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in   millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in  the Civil Rights movement.      </p>
<p>                    Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States, The New Jim Crow reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By   targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.     </p>
<p>                    A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice, The New Jim Crow is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Eugenics was a term coined in 1883 to name the scientific and social theory which advocated &#8220;race improvement&#8221; through selective human breeding. In Europe and the United States the eugenics movement found many supporters before it was finally discredited by its association with the racist ideology of Nazi Germany. Examining for the first time how eugenics was taken up by scientists and social reformers in Latin America, Nancy Leys Stepan compares the eugenics movements in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina with the more familiar cases of Britain, the United States, and Germany.In this highly original account, Stepan sheds new light on the role of science in reformulating issues of race, gender, reproduction, and public health in an era when the focus on national identity was particularly intense. Drawing upon a rich body of evidence concerning the technical publications and professional meetings of Latin American eugenicists, she examines how they adapted eugenic principles to local contexts between the world wars. Stepan shows that Latin American eugenicists diverged considerably from their counterparts in Europe and the United States in their ideological approach and their interpretations of key texts concerning heredity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society.     </p>
<p>                     Some Americans insist that we&#8217;re living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America &#8212; it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.     </p>
<p>                     In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis.     </p>
<p>                     As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation&#8217;s racial inequities.     </p>
<p>                     In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;Unfair succinctly and persuasively recounts cutting-edge research testifying to the faulty and inaccurate procedures that underpin virtually all aspects of our criminal justice system, illustrating many with case studies.&#8221;&#8211;The Boston Globe    </p>
<p>                     A child is gunned down by a police officer; an investigator ignores critical clues in a case; an innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit; a jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken.     </p>
<p>                     But it&#8217;s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.     </p>
<p>                     This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant&#8217;s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In Unfair, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.     </p>
<p>                     Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases&#8211;from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case&#8211;Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society&#8217;s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system&#8217;s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.</p>
