										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not enough merely to espouse a noble vision, the Dalai Lama tells us &#8211; we need to move toward it. The Dalai Lama&#8217;s vision beckons us all. Every one of us can be a force for good&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama has for decades travelled the world, meeting people from all backgrounds and sharing with them his wisdom and compassion.     </p>
<p>                    In his encounters with everyone, from heads to state to inhabitants of shanty towns, he has come across similar problems: values that help the wealthy to advance beyond the poor, an environmental disregard that could lead to global catastrophe and governments in paralysis, bereft of any positive, progressive policies.    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama offers here his unique vision for a global economic system, one that applies principals of fairness and which values fulfilment, focusing on what is truly urgent and why. It is a manifesto that has the potential to reshape humanity as we know it and bring hope to millions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this beautifully written book, Buddhist monk and Nobel Peace Prize nominee Thich Nhat Hanh explains how to acquire the skills of mindfulness. Once we have these skills, we can slow our lives down and discover how to live in the moment &#8211; even simple acts like washing the dishes or drinking a cup of tea may be transformed into acts of meditation.    </p>
<p>                    Thich Nhat Hanh&#8217;s gentle anecdotes and practical exercises help us to arrive at greater self-understanding and peacefulness, whether we are beginners or advanced students. Irrespective of our particular religious beliefs, we can begin to reap the immense benefits that meditation has been scientifically proven to offer. We can all learn how to be mindful and experience the miracle of mindfulness for ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                    FEATURED ON THE DELICIOUSLY ELLA PODCAST    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re all on a search for happiness, but we&#8217;re looking in the wrong places.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone looks externally to find contentment, we think material possessions will unlock our happiness. A Monk&#8217;s Guide to Happiness explains how and why we need to look within, and connect to our true essence, in order to find peace. Everyone has the potential to be happy, after all, we&#8217;re all &#8216;hardwired&#8217; for happiness.    </p>
<p>                    But how do we get there? By meditating. Not just in the morning, but throughout the day by introducing micro moments so we never drop the mindfulness ball, even when we&#8217;re busy. Meditation is more than just a stress-reduction tool or a relaxation therapy, it is the key to finding long-lasting happiness.    </p>
<p>                    Gelong Thubten, a Buddhist monk who has worked with everyone from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to Ruby Wax and Benedict Cumberbatch, explores the theme of happiness in his debut book and explains how to bring meditation into our busy 21st century lives with simple exercises.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thubten is a very generous and kind monk who writes with the lived honesty and humour of someone who has experienced the wisdom he shares. His writing is full of inspiration but also the pragmatism needed to form a sustainable practice. His book clearly illustrates why we all need meditation and mindfulness in our lives.&#8217; &#8211; Benedict Cumberbatch</p>
