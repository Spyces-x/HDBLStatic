										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; In these hilarious essays, the Saturday Night Live head writer and Weekend Update co-anchor learns how to take a beating. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I always wanted to punch his face before I read this book. Now I just want to kick him in the balls.&#8221;&#8211;Larry David </p>
<p>                    NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Cosmopolitan &#8211; Vulture &#8211; Parade</p>
<p>                    If there&#8217;s one trait that makes someone well suited to comedy, it&#8217;s being able to take a punch&#8211;metaphorically and, occasionally, physically. </p>
<p>                    From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and &#8220;seeing the sights&#8221; (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump. </p>
<p>                    You&#8217;ll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). You&#8217;ll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where he&#8217;s written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And you&#8217;ll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian&#8211;from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall. </p>
<p>                    For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother&#8217;s experience on the scene of the Twin Towers&#8217; collapse on 9/11). Told with a healthy dose of self-deprecation, A Very Punchable Face reveals the brilliant mind behind some of the dumbest sketches on television, and lays bare the heart and humor of a hardworking guy&#8211;with a face you can&#8217;t help but want to punch.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Too much power. Wow. Too much energy. Wow. Too much anticipation. WOW. It&#8217;s the new memoir from the biggest star in gaming: Dr Disrespect.</p>
<p>                    Dr Disrespect is a 6-foot-8 freak of nature with a 37-inch vertical, the two-time, back-to-back 1993-94 Blockbuster Video Game Champion, and in his factual opinion, the most dominant international gaming superstar in the history of the world.</p>
<p>                    It was just a matter of time before Western civilization came begging Doc to save literature by writing a memoir that reads like a vicious, muscular lion clawing his way through the rocks, roaring in anger and dominance. Here you will find his deepest, most intimate secrets. The untold history of his mysterious, legendary origins and his rise to unparalleled dominance. And most of all, you will find out what, exactly, Doc&#8217;s a doctor of.</p>
<p>                    Are you ready for a book with the rhythm of a sleazy &#8217;70s muscleman and the ruthlessness of a &#8217;90s serial killer? A journey that stares down the long, dark alley of your fears and never looks back? Does your warrior&#8217;s heart yearn to reach the tippity top of the mountain just to realize you&#8217;re still only halfway up?</p>
<p>                      If so, firm handshakes, Champion: Welcome to the salvation of literature.</p>

                     &#8220;Howard Zinn on acid or some bullsh*t like that.&#8221; -Tim Heidecker</p>
<p>                     The creators of the cult-hit podcast Chapo Trap House deliver a manifesto for everyone who feels orphaned and alienated-politically, culturally, and economically-by the lanyard-wearing Wall Street centrism of the left and the lizard-brained atavism of the right: there is a better way, the Chapo Way.</p>
<p>                    In a guide that reads like &#8220;a weirder, smarter, and deliciously meaner version of The Daily Show&#8217;s 2004 America (The Book)&#8221; (Paste), Chapo Trap House shows you that you don&#8217;t have to side with either sinking ships. These self-described &#8220;assholes from the internet&#8221; offer a fully ironic ideology for all who feel politically hopeless and prefer broadsides and tirades to reasoned debate.</p>
<p>                     Learn the &#8220;secret&#8221; history of the world, politics, media, and everything in-between that THEY don&#8217;t want you to know and chart a course from our wretched present to a utopian future where one can post in the morning, game in the afternoon, and podcast after dinner without ever becoming a poster, gamer, or podcaster.</p>
<p>                     A book that&#8217;s &#8220;as intellectually serious and analytically original as it is irreverent and funny&#8221; (Glenn Greenwald, New York Times bestselling author of No Place to Hide) The Chapo Guide to Revolution features illustrated taxonomies of contemporary liberal and conservative characters, biographies of important thought leaders, &#8220;never before seen&#8221; drafts of Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s Newsroom manga, and the ten new laws that govern Chapo Year Zero (everyone gets a dog, billionaires are turned into Soylent, and logic is outlawed). If you&#8217;re a fan of sacred cows, prisoners being taken, and holds being barred, then this book is NOT for you. However, if you feel disenfranchised from the political and cultural nightmare we&#8217;re in, then Chapo, let&#8217;s go&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six-time world surfing champion, actor, and US heart-throb Kelly Slater tells of the struggles and triumphs he&#8217;s experienced throughout his life and how they have helped him to become one of the world&#8217;s most loved sports figures. From beach blanket bingo to Baywatch, surfing has fascinated people for years, and Kelly Slater is the sport&#8217;s newest star. He&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s most popular surfers; his radical moves have revolutionised the sport. Born in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in 1972, he found surfing to be a great way to escape problems at home. When he was 11, his parents divorced. Slater and his brother, Sean, were raised by their suddenly single mother, who struggled to support two young sons. After Slater&#8217;s surfing career took off, he made the transition into acting and modelling. He spent a season starring on the popular television show Baywatch, where he won the hearts of women young and old, including Pamela Anderson, whom he dated for about a year. He has also been featured in Versace ads. In Pipe Dreams, he shares the stories that have influenced his life and have inspired him to overcome both personal and professional hurdles and achieve his dreams.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The #1 New York Times bestselling (mostly true) memoir from the hilarious author of Furiously Happy.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Gaspingly funny and wonderfully inappropriate.&#8221;&#8211;O, The Oprah Magazine     </p>
<p>                    When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. That dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a morbidly eccentric childhood. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humor in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it.     </p>
<p>                    In the irreverent Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Lawson&#8217;s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments&#8211;the ones we want to pretend never happened&#8211;are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. For every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the dark, disturbing, yet wonderful moments of our lives.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For fans of David Sedaris, Tina Fey and Caitlin Moran comes Furiously Happy from Jenny Lawson, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened.    </p>
<p>                    In Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Jenny Lawson regaled readers with uproarious stories of her bizarre childhood. In Furiously Happy she explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. And terrible ideas are what Jenny does best.    </p>
<p>                    As Jenny says: &#8216;You can&#8217;t experience pain without also experiencing the baffling and ridiculous moments of being fiercely, unapologetically, intensely and (above all) furiously happy.&#8217;  It&#8217;s a philosophy that has &#8211; quite literally &#8211; saved her life.    </p>
<p>                    Jenny&#8217;s first book, Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, was ostensibly about family, but deep down it was about celebrating your own weirdness. Furiously Happy is a book about mental illness, but under the surface it&#8217;s about embracing joy in fantastic and outrageous ways.  And who doesn&#8217;t need a bit more of that?</p>

<p>                    **Pre-order now: David Mitchell&#8217;s new book Dishonesty is the Second-best Policy**</p>
<p>                    There are many aspects of modern life that trouble award-winning comedian David Mitchell, such as: </p>
<p>                    Why is every film or TV programme a sequel or a remake? </p>
<p>                    Why are people so f***ing hung up about swearing? </p>
<p>                    Why do the asterisks in that sentence make it ok? </p>
<p>                    Why do so many people want to stop other people doing things, and how can they be stopped from stopping them?</p>
<p>                    Join Mitchell on a tour of the absurdities of our times &#8211; from Ryanair to Richard III, Downton Abbey to phone etiquette, UKIP to hotdogs made of cats. Funny, provocative and shot through with refreshing amounts of common sense, Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse celebrates and commiserates on the state of things in our not entirely glorious modern world.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Mitchell is an exceptionally clever, eloquent and spot-on commentator. We should be grateful for him.&#8217; Daily Mail, Books of the Year</p>

<p>                    **A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the Emmy-award winning star of Master of None and one of this generation&#8217;s sharpest comedic voices**    </p>
<p>                    In the old days, most people would find a decent person who lived in their village or neighbourhood, and after deciding they weren&#8217;t a murderer, get married and have kids &#8211; all by the age of 22.     </p>
<p>                    Now we spend years of our lives searching for our perfect soul mate and, thanks to dating apps, mobile phones and social media, we have more romantic options than ever before in human history. Yet we also have to confront strange new dilemmas, such as what to think when someone is too busy to reply to a text but has time to post a photo of their breakfast on Instagram. And if we have so many more options, why aren&#8217;t people any less frustrated?     </p>
<p>                    For years, American comedian Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at dating and relationships, and in Modern Romance, he teams up with award-winning sociologist Eric Klinenberg to investigate love in the age of technology. They enlisted some of the world&#8217;s leading social scientists, conducted hundreds of interviews, analyzed the behavioural data, and researched dating cultures from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to New York City. The result is an unforgettable picture of modern love, combining Ansari&#8217;s irreverent humour with cutting-edge social science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>_____________________________<br />
                    Is having &#8216;somebody to love&#8217; the most important thing in your life?<br />
                    Do you constantly believe in Mr Right, and that being with him would guarantee you would no longer feel depressed or lonely?<br />
                    Are you bored with &#8216;nice guys&#8217; who are open, honest and dependable?     </p>
<p>                    If being in love means being in pain, this book was written for you. Leading relationship and marriage therapist Robin Norwood describes loving too much as a pattern of thoughts and behaviour, which certain women develop as a response to problems from childhood.     </p>
<p>                    Many women find themselves repeatedly drawn into unhappy and destructive relationships with men. They then struggle to make these doomed relationships work. This bestselling relationship self-help book investigates and reveals how powerfully addictive these unhealthy relationships are &#8211; but also gives a very specific programme for recovery from the disease of loving too much, a problem that plagues women everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Jon Ronson, the Sunday Times top ten bestselling author of The Psychopath Test, this is a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world&#8217;s most underappreciated forces: shame.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s about the terror, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of what?&#8217; I said.<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of being found out.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us &#8211; people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they&#8217;re being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.    </p>
<p>                    A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people&#8217;s faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.    </p>
<p>                    Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be, So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws &#8211; and the very scary part we all play in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why don&#8217;t we have a lunar colony already? In this witty and entertaining book, Kelly and Zach Weinersmith give us a snapshot of the transformative technologies that are coming next &#8211; from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters &#8211; and explain how they will change our world in astonishing ways. By weaving together their own research, interviews with pioneering scientists and Zach&#8217;s trademark comics, the Weinersmiths investigate why these innovations are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way.</p>

                    &#8216;You&#8217;ll laugh like a drain&#8217; Stylist    </p>
<p>                    Sharp and hilariously funny advice for growing up female from the Netflix star of Always Be My Maybe    </p>
<p>                    Dear Girls is Ali Wong&#8217;s collection of heartfelt and hilarious letters to her daughters covering everything they need to know in life, like the unpleasant details of dating, how to be a working mum in a male-dominated profession and how she trapped their dad.    </p>
<p>                     She shares the wisdom she&#8217;s learned from a life in comedy and reveals stories from her life off stage, including the brutal single life in New York (and the inevitable confrontation with erectile dysfunction), reconnecting with her roots (and drinking snake blood) in Vietnam and parenting war stories. Ali Wong&#8217;s letters are absurdly funny, surprisingly moving and enlightening (and gross) for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unconventional&#8211;yet effective&#8211;parenting strategies, carefully curated by the creator of the popular podcast The Longest Shortest Time     </p>
<p>                    Some of the best parenting advice that Hillary Frank ever received did not come from parenting experts, but from friends and podcast listeners who acted on a whim, often in moments of desperation. These weird parenting wins were born of moments when the expert advice wasn&#8217;t working, and instead of freaking out, these parents had a stroke of genius. For example, there&#8217;s the dad who pig-snorted in his baby&#8217;s ear to get her to stop crying, and the mom who made a flat daddy out of cardboard and sat it at the dinner table when her kids were missing their deployed military father.<br />
                     Every parent and kid is unique, and as we get to know our kids, we can figure out what makes them tick. Because this is an ongoing process, Weird Parenting Wins covers children of all ages, ranging in topics from The Art of Getting Your Kid to Act Like a Person (on hygiene, potty training, and manners) to The Art of Getting Your Kid to Tell You Things (because eventually, they&#8217;re going to be tight-lipped). You may find that someone else&#8217;s weird parenting win works for you, or you might be inspired to try something new the next time you&#8217;re stuck in a parenting rut. Or maybe you&#8217;ll just get a good laugh out of the mom who got her kid to try beets because&#8230;it might turn her poop pink.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than 300 million people in the world speak English and the rest, it sometimes seems, try to&#8230;&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Only Bill Bryson could make a book about the English language so entertaining. With his boundless enthusiasm and restless eye for the absurd, this is his astonishing tour of English. From its mongrel origins to its status as the world&#8217;s most-spoken tongue; its apparent simplicity to its deceptive complexity; its vibrant swearing to its uncertain spelling and pronunciation, Bryson covers all this as well as the many curious eccentricities that make it as maddening to learn as it is flexible to use.     </p>
<p>                    Bill Bryson&#8217;s classic Mother Tongue is a highly readable and hilarious tale of how English came to be the world&#8217;s language.</p>

<p>                    A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism from one of the most-watched cultural observers of her generation    </p>
<p>                    In these funny and insightful essays, Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of color (The Help) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.    </p>
<p>                    Bad Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better, coming from one of our most interesting and important cultural critics.</p>

<p>                     Ten years ago, Ross McCammon made an incredible and unexpected transition from working at an in-flight magazine in suburban Dallas to landing his dream job at Esquire in New York. What followed was a period of almost debilitating anxiety and awkwardness&#8211;interspersed with minor instances of professional glory&#8211;as McCammon learned how to navigate the workplace while feeling entirely ill-equipped for achieving success in his new career.  Works Well with Others is McCammon&#8217;s &#8220;relentlessly funny and soberingly insightful&#8221;* journey from impostor to authority, a story that reveals the workplace for what it is: an often absurd landscape of ego and fear guided by social rules that no one ever talks about. By mining his own experiences at the magazine, McCammon provides advice on everything from firm handshakes to small talk in elevators to dealing with jerks and underminers. Here is an inspirational new way of looking at your job, your career, and success itself; an accessible guide for those of us who are smart, talented, and ambitious but who aren&#8217;t well-&#8220;leveraged&#8221; and don&#8217;t quite feel prepared for success . . . or know what to do once we&#8217;ve made it.  *Entertainment Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why didn&#8217;t he call you back? Why doesn&#8217;t he talk to your friends? Why does he keep putting off your dates? This book has the answers. Now the international bestseller is re-released to change the lives of a new generation.    </p>
<p>                              This is a hilarious, playful, honest explanation of male behaviour from a writer and a consultant of Sex and the City. Stop wasting your time chasing after men who aren&#8217;t into you, and find men who are! Greg Behrendt provides the insight you need to move on and find them.    </p>
<p>                              The idea behind &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; came from a conversation between Greg Behrendt and his fellow (female) SATC writers, when they asked his advice one day. This conversation became the seed of an episode which struck a powerful chord with viewers. Before long, Greg became aware that this simple phrase had the power to change women&#8217;s lives.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; is now a worldwide phenomenon. Over 100k copies have been sold across all editions, it has topped bestseller charts internationally, and has been made into a major Hollywood film. Now repackaged for a new generation with an eyecatching new cover, He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You is essential armour for the modern woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Lyons was Technology Editor at Newsweek Magazine for years, a magazine writer at the top of his profession. One Friday morning he received a phone call: his job no longer existed. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was unemployed and facing financial oblivion. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the nebulous role of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What could possibly go wrong?     </p>
<p>                     What follows is a hilarious and excoriating account of Dan&#8217;s time at the start-up and a revealing window onto the dysfunctional culture that prevails in a world flush with cash and devoid of experience. Filled with stories of meaningless jargon, teddy bears at meetings, push-up competitions and all-night parties, this uproarious tale is also a trenchant analysis of the dysfunctional start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them. It is a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to cash out with a fortune.</p>

If you&#8217;re going to take a hike, it&#8217;s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you&#8217;ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way-and a couple of bears. Already a classic, A Walk in the Woods  will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    The popular FOX News star of Tucker Carlson Tonight offers his signature fearless and funny political commentary on how America&#8217;s ruling class has failed everyday Americans.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;You look on in horror, helpless and desperate.<br />
                     You have nowhere to go.<br />
                     You&#8217;re trapped on a ship of fools.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8211;From the Introduction     </p>
<p>                     In Ship of Fools: How a Selfish Ruling Class is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution, Tucker Carlson tells the truth about the new American elites, a group whose power and wealth has grown beyond imagination even as the rest of the country has withered. The people who run America now barely interact with it. They fly on their own planes, ski on their own mountains, watch sporting events far from the stands in sky boxes. They have total contempt for you.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;They view America the way a private equity firm sizes up an aging conglomerate,&#8221; Carlson writes, &#8220;as something outdated they can profit from. When it fails, they&#8217;re gone.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     In Ship of Fools,  Tucker Carlson offers a blistering critique of our new overlords. Traditional liberals are gone, he writes. The patchouli-scented hand-wringers who worried about whales and defended free speech have been replaced by globalists who hide their hard-edged economic agenda behind the smokescreen of identity politics. They&#8217;ll outsource your job while lecturing you about transgender bathrooms. Left and right, Carlson says, are no longer meaningful categories in America. &#8220;The rift is between those who benefit from the status quo, and those who don&#8217;t.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     Our leaders are fools, Carlson concludes, &#8220;unaware that they are captains of a sinking ship.&#8221; But in the signature and witty style that viewers of Tucker Carlson Tonight have come to enjoy, his book answers the all-important question: How do we put the country back on course?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raised by a pro-black, Pan-Afrikan single mother during the crack years of 1980s Washington, DC, and educated at Sidwell Friends School and Harvard University, Baratunde Thurston has over thirty years&#8217; experience being black. Now, through stories of his politically inspired Nigerian name, the heroics of his hippie mother, the murder of his drug-abusing father, and other revelatory black details, he shares with readers of all colors his wisdom and expertise in how to be black. Beyond memoir, this guidebook offers practical advice on everything from &#8220;How to Be The Black Friend&#8221; to &#8220;How to Be The (Next) Black President&#8221; to &#8220;How to Celebrate Black History Month&#8221;. To provide additional perspective, Baratunde assembled an award-winning Black Panel-three black women, three black men, and one white man (Christian Lander of &#8220;Stuff White People Like&#8221;) &#8211; and asked them such revealing questions as: When did you first realize you were black? How black are you? Can you swim? The result is a humorous, intelligent, and audacious guide that challenges and satirizes the so-called experts, purists, and racists who purport to speak for all black people.<br />
                    With honest storytelling and biting wit, Baratunde plots a path not just to blackness, but one open to anyone interested in simply how to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    FULLY REVISED &#038; UPDATED, WITH A NEW EPILOGUE    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Delightful.&#8221;-The Economist    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s Santa Claus, Shakespeare, Mickey Mouse, the Bible, and then there&#8217;s Star Wars. Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williams&#8217;s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.    </p>
<p>                              In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the films&#8217; wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Neutral&#8217; Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world.    </p>
<p>                    Finns have the largest per capita gun ownership after the US and Yemen.    </p>
<p>                    54 per cent of Icelanders believe in elves.    </p>
<p>                    Norway is the richest country on earth.    </p>
<p>                    5 per cent of Danish men have had sex with an animal.    </p>
<p>                    Michael Booth has lived among the Scandinavians, on and off, for over ten years, perplexed by their many strange paradoxes and character traits and equally bemused by the unquestioning enthusiasm for all things Nordic and hygge that has engulfed the rest of the world.     </p>
<p>                    He leaves his adopted home of Denmark and embarks on a journey through all five of the Nordic countries to discover who these curious tribes are, the secrets of their success and, most intriguing of all, what they think of each other. Along the way a more nuanced, often darker picture emerges of a region plagued by taboos, characterised by suffocating parochialism and populated by extremists of various shades.    </p>

<p>                    From the author of the bestselling book everyone is talking about, The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k.    </p>
<p>                    How to stop worrying about what you should do, so you can finish what you need to do and start doing what you want to do.    </p>
<p>                    Ever find yourself snowed under at the office &#8211; or even just glued to the sofa &#8211; when you really want to get out (for once), get to the gym (at last), and get started on that daunting dream project you&#8217;re always putting off? Or if you are confined to barracks and that&#8217;s driving you nuts, then it&#8217;s time to get your sh*t together.     </p>
<p>                      In The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F**k, &#8216;anti-guru&#8217; Sarah Knight introduced the joys of mental decluttering. Get Your Sh*t Together takes you one stop further &#8211; organizing the f*cks you want and need to give to help you quit your day job and move abroad, balance work and fun &#8211; and save money while you&#8217;re at it &#8211; or simply get out of the door for happy hour, every day.     </p>
<p>                    What everyone is saying about our favourite anti-guru Sarah Knight:    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the creator of Dilbert and author of Win Bigly, a guide to spotting and avoiding loserthink: sneaky mental habits trapping victims in their own bubbles of reality.     </p>
<p>                    If you&#8217;ve been on social media lately, or turned on your TV, you may have noticed a lot of dumb ideas floating around.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;We know when history will repeat and when it won&#8217;t.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;We can tell the difference between evidence and coincidences.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;The simplest explanation is usually true.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    Wrong, wrong, and dangerous!    </p>
<p>                    If we&#8217;re not careful, loserthink would have us believe that every Trump supporter is a bigoted racist, addicts should be responsible for fixing the opioid epidemic, and that your relationship fell apart simply because you chewed with your mouth open.    </p>
<p>                    Even the smartest people can slip into loserthink&#8217;s seductive grasp. This book will teach you how to spot and avoid it&#8211;and will give you scripts to respond when hollow arguments are being brandished against you, whether by well-intentioned friends, strangers on the internet, or political pundits. You&#8217;ll also learn how to spot the underlying causes of loserthink, like the inability to get ego out of your decisions, thinking with words instead of reasons, failing to imagine alternative explanations, and making too much of coincidences.    </p>
<p>                    Your bubble of reality doesn&#8217;t have to be a prison.  This book will show you how to break free&#8211;and, what&#8217;s more, to be among the most perceptive and respected thinkers in every conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author of the bestselling You Are Not So Smart gives readers a fighting chance at outsmarting their not-so-smart brains.      </p>
<p>                    A mix of popular psychology and trivia, You Are Now Less Dumb is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality&#8211;except we&#8217;re not. But that&#8217;s okay, because our delusions keep us sane.     </p>
<p>                    Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of seventeen ways we fool ourselves every day, including:<br />
                    Enclothed Cognition (the clothes you wear change your behavior and influence your mental abilities)The Benjamin Franklin Effect (how you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate the people you harm).Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality)The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater effect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us)Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don&#8217;t enjoy just to make the time or money already invested &#8220;worth it&#8221;)McRaney also reveals the true price of happiness, and how to avoid falling for our own lies.</p>
