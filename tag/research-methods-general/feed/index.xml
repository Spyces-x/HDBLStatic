<p>                    A Best Science Book of the Year for the Guardian, Financial Times, and New Scientist    </p>
<p>                    It was the universe&#8217;s most elusive particle, the linchpin for everything scientists dreamed up to explain how physics works. It had to be found. But projects as big as CERN&#8217;s Large Hadron Collider don&#8217;t happen without incredible risks &#8211; or occasional skulduggery. In the definitive account of the greatest science story of our time, acclaimed physicist Sean Carroll reveals the insights, rivalry, and wonder that fuelled the Higgs discovery, and takes us on a riveting and irresistible ride to the very edge of physics today.</p>
