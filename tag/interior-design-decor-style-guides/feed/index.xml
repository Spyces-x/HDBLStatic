										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NUMBER ONE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    From one of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy and The School of Life, The Architecture of Happiness explores the fascinating hidden links between the buildings we live in and our long-term wellbeing.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Engaging and intelligent . . . Full of splendid ideas, happily and beautifully expressed&#8217; Independent    </p>
<p>                    What makes a house truly beautiful? Why are many new houses so ugly? Why do we argue so bitterly about sofas and pictures &#8211; and can differences of taste ever be satisfactorily resolved?    </p>
<p>                    To answer these questions and many more, de Botton looks at buildings across the world, from medieval wooden huts to modern skyscrapers; he examines sofas and cathedrals, tea sets and office complexes, and teases out a host of often surprising philosophical insights. The Architecture of Happiness will take you on a beguiling tour through the history and psychology of architecture and interior design, and will change the way you look at your home.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Alain de Botton takes big, complex subjects and writes about them with thoughtful and deceptive innocence&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Clever, provocative and fresh as a daisy&#8217; Literary Review</p>
