										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A unique approach to decluttering for anyone in the process of downsizing, from Australia&#8217;s organising expert.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you&#8217;re selling your family home, blending households, or cleaning out your ageing parents&#8217; home, sorting through a lifetime&#8217;s worth of accumulated possessions can be a daunting and stressful experience. When decluttering guru Peter Walsh went through the process of downsizing his childhood home and dividing his late parents&#8217; possessions among his family, he realised that making these decisions about mementos and heirlooms creates strong emotions and can be an overwhelming chore.     </p>
<p>                    In Let It Go, Walsh helps you turn downsizing into a rejuvenating life change. He offers useful tips and practical takeaways, including how to understand the emotional challenges that accompany downsizing, establishing a hierarchy of mementos and collectibles, calculating the amount of stuff you can bring into your new life, and creating strategies for dividing heirlooms among family members without drama. Change your mindset around possessions and feel freer and happier than you ever thought possible when you learn to Let It Go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how TEN habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour &#8211; the NEW book from the creator of the chimp management mind model and author of the million copy selling The Chimp Paradox .    </p>
<p>                    My Hidden Chimp is an effective and powerful new educational book that offers parents, teachers and carers some ideas and thoughts on how to help children to develop healthy habits for life. The science behind the habits is discussed in a practical way with exercises and activities to help children think the habits through and start putting them into practice. The neuroscience of the mind is simplified for children to understand and then use to their advantage.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Steve Peters explains neuroscience in a straightforward and intuitive way &#8211; offering up 10 simple habits that we as adults and children should have in our arsenal to deal with everyday life.    </p>
<p>                    They include:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Smiling<br />
                    &#8211; The importance of talking through your feelings<br />
                    &#8211; Learning how to say sorry<br />
                    &#8211; Knowing how to ask for help    </p>
<p>                    By also explaining the developing &#8216;chimp&#8217; brain in children, he shows us how 10 habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour. These 10 habits should and can be retained for life.    </p>
<p>                    This is an important and another groundbreaking new book from the bestselling author of The Chimp Paradox and the creator of the chimp management mind model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though anxiety has risen among young people overall, recent research studies confirm that it has skyrocketed in girls since the turn of the century. So what&#8217;s to blame? And how can we help these girls?    </p>
<p>                    In the same engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first book, Untangled, clinical psychologist Lisa Damour starts by examining the science of stress and anxiety, then turns to the many facets of girls&#8217; lives where stress hits them hard: the parental expectations they face at home, pressures at school, social anxiety among their peers, and on social media. Exploring the multiple layers of girls&#8217; lives, Damour shows us the critical steps we can take to shield them from the toxic stress to which both our culture and also we, as their caregivers, subject them.    </p>
<p>                    Readers familiar with Damour from Untangled or from her New York Times journalism will be drawn to this important new contribution to understanding and supporting today&#8217;s girls &#8211; and tomorrow&#8217;s young women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading clinical psychologist Lisa Damour identifies the seven key phases marking the journey from girlhood to womanhood, and offers practical advice for those raising teenage girls.    </p>
<p>                    We expect an enormous amount from our teenage girls in a world where they are bombarded with messages about how they should look, behave, succeed. Yet we also speak as though adolescence is a nightmare rollercoaster ride for both parent and child, to be endured rather than enjoyed.     </p>
<p>                    In Untangled, world authority and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour provides an accessible, detailed, comprehensive guide to parenting teenage girls. She believes there is a predictable blueprint for how girls grow; seven easily recognisable &#8216;strands&#8217; of transition from childhood through adolescence and on to adulthood. Girls naturally develop at different rates, typically on more than one front, and the transition will be unique to every girl.     </p>
<p>                    Each chapter describes a phase, such as &#8216;contending with adult authority&#8217; and &#8216;entering the romantic world&#8217;, with hints and tips for parents and daughters, and a &#8216;when to worry&#8217; section. Damour writes sympathetically and clearly, providing a practical and helpful guide for any parent, and for teenage girls too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; The perfect gift for new parents and grandparents this Mother&#8217;s Day: a bighearted book of wisdom, wit, and insight, celebrating the love and joy of being a grandmother, from the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and #1 bestselling author     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;This tender book should be required reading for grandparents everywhere.&#8221;&#8211;Booklist (starred review)     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I am changing his diaper, he is kicking and complaining, his exhausted father has gone to the kitchen for a glass of water, his exhausted mother is prone on the couch. He weighs little more than a large sack of flour and yet he has laid waste to the living room: swaddles on the chair, a nursing pillow on the sofa, a car seat, a stroller. No one cares about order, he is our order, we revolve around him. And as I try to get in the creases of his thighs with a wipe, I look at his, let&#8217;s be honest, largely formless face and unfocused eyes and fall in love with him. Look at him and think, well, that&#8217;s taken care of, I will do anything for you as long as we both shall live, world without end, amen.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     Before blogs even existed, Anna Quindlen became a go-to writer on the joys and challenges of family, motherhood, and modern life, in her nationally syndicated column. Now she&#8217;s taking the next step and going full nana in the pages of this lively, beautiful, and moving book about being a grandmother. Quindlen offers thoughtful and telling observations about her new role, no longer mother and decision-maker but secondary character and support to the parents of her grandson. She writes, &#8220;Where I once led, I have to learn to follow.&#8221; Eventually a close friend provides words to live by: &#8220;Did they ask you?&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     Candid, funny, frank, and illuminating, Quindlen&#8217;s singular voice has never been sharper or warmer. With the same insights she brought to motherhood in Living Out Loud and to growing older in Lots of Candles, Plenty of Cake, this new nana uses her own experiences to illuminate those of many others.     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Nanaville     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Witty and thoughtful . . . Nanaville serves up enough vivid anecdotes and fresh insights&#8211;about childhood, about parenthood, about grandparenthood and about life&#8211;to make for a gratifying read.&#8221;&#8211;The New York Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Classic, bittersweet Quindlen . . . [Her] wonder at seeing her eldest child grow into his new role is lovely and moving. . . . The best parts of Nanaville are the charming vignettes of Quindlen&#8217;s solo time with her grandson.&#8221;&#8211;NPR</p>

<p>                    &#8220;Gripping&#8230;how can teachers snatch back their critical role and give children the necessary space to fail? They could start by making parents read Lahey.&#8221; &#8212; New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Paul Tough&#8217;s How Children Succeed and Wendy Mogel&#8217;s The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, this groundbreaking manifesto focuses on the critical school years when parents must learn to allow their children to experience the disappointment and frustration that occur from life&#8217;s inevitable problems so that they can grow up to be successful, resilient, and self-reliant adults.    </p>
<p>                    Modern parenting is defined by an unprecedented level of overprotectiveness: parents who rush to school at the whim of a phone call to deliver forgotten assignments, who challenge teachers on report card disappointments, mastermind children&#8217;s friendships, and interfere on the playing field. As teacher and writer Jessica Lahey explains, even though these parents see themselves as being highly responsive to their children&#8217;s well being, they aren&#8217;t giving them the chance to experience failure&#8211;or the opportunity to learn to solve their own problems.    </p>
<p>                    Overparenting has the potential to ruin a child&#8217;s confidence and undermine their education, Lahey reminds us. Teachers don&#8217;t just teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. They teach responsibility, organization, manners, restraint, and foresight&#8211;important life skills children carry with them long after they leave the classroom.    </p>
<p>                    Providing a path toward solutions, Lahey lays out a blueprint with targeted advice for handling homework, report cards, social dynamics, and sports. Most importantly, she sets forth a plan to help parents learn to step back and embrace their children&#8217;s failures. Hard-hitting yet warm and wise, The Gift of Failure is essential reading for parents, educators, and psychologists nationwide who want to help children succeed.</p>
