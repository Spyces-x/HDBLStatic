										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The pieces are in place. The curtain rises for the final act. God is about to die.    </p>
<p>                    An unprecedented conspiracy of injustice, cruelty, and religious and political interests sentenced a man guilty of no crimes to the most barbaric method of execution ever devised. The victim was no mere man. Jesus was God in the flesh. The Creator of life died.    </p>
<p>                    How did such a thing come to be? Who were the onlookers, the players, the fakes, frauds, and heroes? What was it like in the Upper Room that night, in the shadows of Gethsemane, or in the Praetorium awaiting Pilate&#8217;s verdict? What is the meaning of the last words Jesus uttered as He gasped for breath on the cross? What if all the facts you now so well could come alive in your ind and heart as a living story, rather than as a 2000-year-old ancient account?    </p>
<p>                    By piecing together the narrative from the perspective of the participants, John MacArthur invites you to relive the most awesome injustice in the history of man, the unparalleled triumph of the sovereignty of God, and the passion of Christ.</p>

<p>                    Drawing on his own experience as a priest and shepherd, Pope Francis discusses mercy, a subject of central importance in his religious teaching and testimony, and in addition sums up other ideas &#8211; reconciliation, the closeness of God &#8211; that comprise the heart of his papacy. Written in conversation with Vatican expert and La Stampa journalist Andrea Tornielli, The Name of God is Mercy is directed at everyone, inside or outside of the Catholic Church, seeking meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, or the healing of physical or spiritual wounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this powerful and personal reflection, a New York Times bestseller, President Jimmy Carter contemplates how faith has sustained him in happiness and disappointment and considers how we may find it in our own lives.     </p>
<p>                    All his life, President Jimmy Carter has been a courageous exemplar of faith. Now he shares the lessons he learned. He writes, &#8220;The issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. The religious aspects of faith are also covered, since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Quoting eminent Protestant theologians, in Faith President Carter describes his belief in religious freedom, moral politics, and the place of prayer in his daily life. He examines faith&#8217;s many meanings, he describes how to accept it, live it, how to doubt and find faith again. This is a serious and moving reflection from one of America&#8217;s most admired and respected citizens.</p>

<p>                    How to Love shows that when we feel closer to our loved ones, we are also more connected to the world as a whole. Nhat Hanh brings his signature clarity, compassion and humour to the thorny question of how to love and distils one of our strongest emotions down to four essentials: you can only love another when you feel true love for yourself; love is understanding; understanding brings compassion; and deep listening and loving speech are key ways of showing our love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The physiologist Benjamin Libet famously demonstrated that activity in the brain&#8217;s motor regions can be detected some 300 milliseconds before a person feels that he has decided to move. Another lab recently used fMRI data to show that some &#8220;conscious&#8221; decisions can be predicted up to 10 seconds before they enter awareness (long before the preparatory motor activity detected by Libet). Clearly, findings of this kind are difficult to reconcile with the sense that one is the conscious source of one&#8217;s actions.     </p>
<p>                    The question of free will is no mere curio of philosophy seminars. A belief in free will underwrites both the religious notion of &#8220;sin&#8221; and our enduring commitment to retributive justice. The Supreme Court has called free will a &#8220;universal and persistent&#8221; foundation for our system of law. Any scientific developments that threatened our notion of free will would seem to put the ethics of punishing people for their bad behaviour in question.In Free Will Harris debates these ideas and asks whether or not, given what brain science is telling us, we actually have free will?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone has a purpose.  And, according to Oprah Winfrey, &#8216;Your real job in life is to figure out as soon as possible what that is, who you are meant to be, and begin to honour your calling in the best way possible.&#8217;      </p>
<p>                    That journey starts right here.     </p>
<p>                    In her book, The Path Made Clear, Oprah shares what she sees as a guide for activating your deepest vision of yourself, offering the framework for creating not just a life of success, but one of significance.  The book&#8217;s ten chapters are organized to help you recognize the important milestones along the road to self-discovery, laying out what you really need in order to achieve personal contentment, and what life&#8217;s detours are there to teach us.     </p>
<p>                    Oprah opens each chapter by sharing her own key lessons and the personal stories that helped set the course for her best life.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if we stopped avoiding the difficult people in our lives and committed to simply loving everybody? What happens when we give away love like we&#8217;re made of it? In Everybody, Always, Bob Goff&#8217;s joyful New York Times bestselling follow-up to Love Does, you&#8217;ll discover the secret to living without fear, constraint, or worry.     </p>
<p>                    Bob teaches us that the path toward the outsized, unfettered, liberated existence we all long for is found in one simple truth: love people, even the difficult ones, without distinction and without limits.    </p>
<p>                    In Everybody, Always, Bob shows us the simple truths about life that have the power to shift our mindset forever:    </p>
<p>                    Jesus uses our blind spots to reveal himself to us<br />
                    It&#8217;s easy to love kind, lovely, humble people, but you have to tackle fear in order to love people who are difficult<br />
                    What we do with our love will become the conversations we have with God<br />
                    Dark and scary places are filled with beautiful people who need our unconditional love<br />
                    Extravagant love has extraordinary power to change lives, including our own    </p>
<p>                    Driven by Bob&#8217;s trademark storytelling, this book reveals the wisdom Bob learned&#8211;often the hard way&#8211;about what it means to love without inhibition, insecurity, or restriction. From finding the right friends to discovering the upside of failure, Everybody, Always points the way to embodying love by doing the unexpected, the intimidating, the seemingly impossible.    </p>
<p>                    Whether losing his shoes while skydiving solo or befriending a Ugandan witch doctor, Bob steps into life with a no-limits embrace of others that is as infectious as it is extraordinarily ordinary. Everybody, Always reveals how we can do the same.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From one of America&#8217;s most brilliant writers, a New York Times bestselling journey through psychology, philosophy, and lots of meditation to show how Buddhism holds the key to moral clarity and enduring happiness.    </p>
<p>                    At the heart of Buddhism is a simple claim: The reason we suffer-and the reason we make other people suffer-is that we don&#8217;t see the world clearly. At the heart of Buddhist meditative practice is a radical promise: We can learn to see the world, including ourselves, more clearly and so gain a deep and morally valid happiness.    </p>
<p>                     In this &#8220;sublime&#8221; (The New Yorker), pathbreaking book, Robert Wright shows how taking this promise seriously can change your life-how it can loosen the grip of anxiety, regret, and hatred, and how it can deepen your appreciation of beauty and of other people. He also shows why this transformation works, drawing on the latest in neuroscience and psychology, and armed with an acute understanding of human evolution.    </p>
<p>                     This book is the culmination of a personal journey that began with Wright&#8217;s landmark book on evolutionary psychology, The Moral Animal, and deepened as he immersed himself in meditative practice and conversed with some of the world&#8217;s most skilled meditators. The result is a story that is &#8220;provocative, informative and&#8230;deeply rewarding&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review), and as entertaining as it is illuminating. Written with the wit, clarity, and grace for which Wright is famous, Why Buddhism Is True lays the foundation for a spiritual life in a secular age and shows how, in a time of technological distraction and social division, we can save ourselves from ourselves, both as individuals and as a species.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We grow more spiritually by doing it wrong than by doing it right     </p>
<p>                    In Falling Upward, Fr Richard Rohr offers a new understanding of one of life&#8217;s most profound mysteries: how our failing can be the foundation for our ongoing spiritual growth. Drawing on the wisdom from time-honoured myths, heroic poems, great thinkers and sacred religious texts, the author explores the two halves of life to show that those who have fallen, failed, or &#8216;gone down&#8217; are the only ones who understand &#8216;up&#8217;. The heartbreaks, disappointments and loves of the first half of life are actually stepping stones to the spiritual joys that the second half has in store for us.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I thank God for Richard Rohr&#8217;s sage-like presence in our culture: I honestly don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d be without it.&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Anne Lamott is my Oprah.&#8221; -Chicago Tribune    </p>
<p>                    The New York Times bestseller from the author of Dusk, Night, Dawn, Almost Everything and Bird by Bird, a powerful exploration of mercy and how we can embrace it.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Mercy is radical kindness,&#8221; Anne Lamott writes in her enthralling and heartening book, Hallelujah Anyway. It&#8217;s the permission you give others-and yourself-to forgive a debt, to absolve the unabsolvable, to let go of the judgment and pain that make life so difficult.    </p>
<p>                    In Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy Lamott ventures to explore where to find meaning in life. We should begin, she suggests, by &#8220;facing a great big mess, especially the great big mess of ourselves.&#8221; It&#8217;s up to each of us to recognize the presence and importance of mercy everywhere-&#8220;within us and outside us, all around us&#8221;-and to use it to forge a deeper understanding of ourselves and more honest connections with each other. While that can be difficult to do, Lamott argues that it&#8217;s crucial, as &#8220;kindness towards others, beginning with myself, buys us a shot at a warm and generous heart, the greatest prize of all.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Full of Lamott&#8217;s trademark honesty, humor and forthrightness, Hallelujah Anyway is profound and caring, funny and wise-a hopeful book of hands-on spirituality.</p>
