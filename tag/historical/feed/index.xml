Even Sherlock hasn&#8217;t the slightest clue as to where he could be. Enola is intrigued but wary; she&#8217;s still hiding from her older brothers, and getting involved could prove to be disastrous. But Enola can&#8217;t help but investigate, especially when she learns that a bizarre bouquet&#8211;with flowers all symbolizing death&#8211;has been delivered to the Watson residence. Enola knows she must act quickly, but can she find Dr. Watson in time?</p>

<p>                    Join us on this incredible time-travel adventure!     </p>
<p>                     Liberty, my wisecracking horse, our old friends Cam, Tommy, Freedom, and I are off to meet some super-brave soldiers in the year 1775. Yep, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll be visiting with the underdog heroes who fought for American independence, against all odds&#8211;and won! But not before eight very real years of danger and uncertainty. Be a part of Rush Revere&#8217;s crew as we rush, rush, rush into a time when British rule had become a royal pain, and rebellion was in the air. We&#8217;ll be on hand to see two lanterns hung in the Old North Church, prevent a British spy from capturing Paul Revere, and grapple with danger at the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.     </p>
<p>                     The extra special part of this trip is that right here in the twenty-first century, Cam&#8217;s dad is a soldier fighting in Afghanistan, and Cam has been pretty angry that he is away. Visiting with exceptional American heroes like Dr. Joseph Warren and George Washington, racing along after Paul Revere on his midnight ride, and seeing the Declaration of Independence signed make Cam see his own dad in a new and special way.     </p>
<p>                     But don&#8217;t worry. Along with the danger, excitement, and patriotism, there will still be time to stop for a delicious spinach, oats, and alfalfa smoothie. No, wait&#8211;that one&#8217;s for Liberty. The kids and I voted for strawberries.     </p>
<p>                     Now let&#8217;s open the magic portal to the past!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books 1-8 of the New York Times bestselling Magic Tree House series plus an interview with Mary Pope Osborne!</p>
<p>                    Meet Jack and Annie!</p>
<p>                    Jack and his younger sister, Annie, are just regular kids. But when they discover a tree house in the woods, something magical happens. In books 1-4, Jack and Annie are whisked back in time to the Age of Dinosaurs, a medieval castle, ancient pyramids, and treasure-seeking pirates. In books 5-8, Jack and Annie&#8217;s friend, Morgan le Fay, is in trouble! They must find four M things to free her from a spell. Their adventures take them to meet a ninja master in ancient Japan, flee a crocodile on the Amazon River, discover the cave people of the Ice Age, and blast off to the moon in the future. It&#8217;s a difficult and dangerous mission, but Jack and Annie will do anything to save a friend! </p>
<p>                    Audiobooks in this set include: Dinosaurs Before Dark (#1), The Knight at Dawn (#2), Mummies in the Morning (#3), Pirates Past Noon (#4), Night of the Ninjas (#5), Afternoon on the Amazon (#6), Sunset of the Sabertooth (#7), and Midnight on the Moon (#8). </p>
<p>                    Mary Pope Osborne brings together just the right combination of history, magic, and fast-paced adventure to satisfy kids, parents, teachers, and librarians all over the world with her New York Times bestselling series. </p>
<p>                    Osborne&#8217;s narration is low-key and well-paced. A great way to introduce children who are reluctant readers or can&#8217;t yet read to this highly entertaining book series and to reading in general.&#8211;Chicago Parent</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Osborne&#8217;s soothing, beautifully articulated voice and knack for characterization are reliably pleasing.&#8211;AudioFile</p>
