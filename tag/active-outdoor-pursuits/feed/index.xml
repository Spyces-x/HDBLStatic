										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe De Sena, one of the founding creators of Spartan Races, sounds the alarm of how soft and weak we&#8217;ve become through modern living. Spartan Up! is a call to arms, motivating readers to take action in their lives through inspiring stories and practical advice.    </p>
<p>                    What do marathoners do when 26.2 miles just isn&#8217;t enough anymore? They try obstacle racing, combining the endurance challenges of a marathon with the mind- and body-bending rigors of overcoming obstacles along the way. At the heart of this phenomenon is Joe De Sena, the driving force behind the Spartan Race.     </p>
<p>                    De Sena overcame his own obstacles&#8211;working his way from Queens to Wall Street to legendary extreme athlete&#8211;by adhering to a simple philosophy: commit to a goal, put in the work, and get it done. From that philosophy, as played out now for millions across trails, through mud, and up mountainsides, the Spartan Race was born.     </p>
<p>                    Filled with unforgettable stories of Spartan racers as well as hard-won truths learned along the course, Spartan Up! will help you reach your full potential in whatever you set out to do.    </p>
<p>                    A must-read for anyone looking to take his performance to the next level, be it in athletics or in life.&#8211;Dean Karnazes, author of Ultra Marathon Man     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;If there&#8217;s anyone out there who has taken extreme to a new level, its Joe De Sena&#8211;in adventure racing, in business, and ultimately in the business of adventure! Spartan Up! is a must-read.&#8221;&#8211;Robyn Benincasa, world champion adventure racer and New York Times best-selling author of How Winning Works</p>
