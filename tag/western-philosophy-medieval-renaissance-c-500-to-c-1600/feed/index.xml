<p>                    &#8220;If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how you have the capacity to wonder, some fascinating insights await you in these pages.&#8221; &#8211;Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    As concise and enlightening as Seven Brief Lessons on Physics and Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, this mind-expanding dive into the mystery of consciousness is an illuminating meditation on the self, free will, and felt experience.    </p>
<p>                    What is consciousness? How does it arise? And why does it exist? We take our experience of being in the world for granted. But the very existence of consciousness raises profound questions: Why would any collection of matter in the universe be conscious? How are we able to think about this? And why should we?    </p>
<p>                    In this wonderfully accessible book, Annaka Harris guides us through the evolving definitions, philosophies, and scientific findings that probe our limited understanding of consciousness. Where does it reside, and what gives rise to it? Could it be an illusion, or a universal property of all matter? As we try to understand consciousness, we must grapple with how to define it and, in the age of artificial intelligence, who or what might possess it.     </p>
<p>                    Conscious offers lively and challenging arguments that alter our ideas about consciousness-allowing us to think freely about it for ourselves, if indeed we can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the philosophy of sweat? Reality TV? Domestic warfare? Making up and having sex? Take a sparkling ride through an ordinary day with hilarious philosophical gadfly Robert Rowland Smith in Breakfast with Socrates.     </p>
<p>                    Ever want to have a bagel with Hegel? Eggs with Bacon? Or spend a day with Socrates, Mill, Herodotus, or Kant, able to pick their brains about the most mundane moments of your life? Former Oxford Philosophy Fellow Robert Rowland Smith thought he would, and so with dry wit and marvelous invention, Smith whisks you through a typical day, injecting a little philosophy into it at every turn. Wake up with Descartes, go to work with Plato and Nietzsche, visit the gym with Kant, have sex with Ovid (or Simone de Beauvoir).     </p>
<p>                    As the day unfolds, Smith grounds complex, abstract ideas in concrete experience, giving you an informal introduction to applying philosophy to everyday life. Not only does Breakfast with Socrates cover the basic arguments of philosophy, it brings an irresistible, insouciant charm to its big questions, waking us up to the richest possible range of ideas on how to live. Neither breakfast, lunch, nor dinner will ever be the same again.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.&#8217; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    Everyone says they want to be happy. But that&#8217;s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness &#8211; from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#8217;s suggested routes to happiness and success &#8211; such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals &#8211; can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety.    </p>
<p>                    Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that &#8216;everything&#8217;s fine&#8217; even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Immensely positive and life-affirming&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;This is the blue print to a good life&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Have Or to Be? is one of the seminal books of the second half of the 20th century. Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not exercising as much as you should? Counting your calories in your sleep? Feeling ashamed for not being happier? You may be a victim of the wellness syndrome. In this ground-breaking new book, Carl Cederstrom and Andre Spicer argue that the ever-present pressure to maximize our wellness has started to work against us, making us feel worse and provoking us to withdraw into ourselves. The Wellness Syndrome follows health freaks who go to extremes to find the perfect diet, corporate athletes who start the day with a dance party, and the self-trackers who monitor everything, including their own toilet habits. This is a world where feeling good has become indistinguishable from being good. Visions of social change have been reduced to dreams of individual transformation, political debate has been replaced by insipid moralising, and scientific evidence has been traded for new-age delusions. A lively and humorous diagnosis of the cult of wellness, this book is an indispensable guide for everyone suspicious of our relentless quest to be happier and healthier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A passionate defence of the enduring power of human nature &#8230; both life-affirming and deeply satisfying&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    Recently many people have assumed that we are blank slates shaped by our  environment. But this denies the heart of our being: human nature.  Violence is not just a product of society; male and female minds are  different; the genes we give our children shape them more than our  parenting practices. To acknowledge our innate abilities, Pinker shows,  is not to condone inequality, but to understand the very foundations of  humanity.    </p>
