										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country&#8217;s leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting&#8211;sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they&#8217;re not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that &#8220;cool&#8221; equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of &#8220;mother blame,&#8221; &#8220;boy biology,&#8221; and &#8220;testosterone,&#8221; the authors shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive&#8211;the emotional miseducation of boys. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy&#8211;giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; More than 1 million copies in print! &#8211; The authors of No-Drama Discipline and The Yes Brain explain the new science of how a child&#8217;s brain is wired and how it matures in this pioneering, practical book.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Simple, smart, and effective solutions to your child&#8217;s struggles.&#8221;&#8211;Harvey Karp, M.D.     </p>
<p>                     In this pioneering, practical book, Daniel J. Siegel, neuropsychiatrist and author of the bestselling Mindsight, and parenting expert Tina Payne Bryson offer a revolutionary approach to child rearing with twelve key strategies that foster healthy brain development, leading to calmer, happier children. The authors explain&#8211;and make accessible&#8211;the new science of how a child&#8217;s brain is wired and how it matures. The &#8220;upstairs brain,&#8221; which makes decisions and balances emotions, is under construction until the mid-twenties. And especially in young children, the right brain and its emotions tend to rule over the logic of the left brain. No wonder kids throw tantrums, fight, or sulk in silence. By applying these discoveries to everyday parenting, you can turn any outburst, argument, or fear into a chance to integrate your child&#8217;s brain and foster vital growth.     </p>
<p>                     Complete with age-appropriate strategies for dealing with day-to-day struggles and illustrations that will help you explain these concepts to your child, The Whole-Brain Child shows you how to cultivate healthy emotional and intellectual development so that your children can lead balanced, meaningful, and connected lives.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;[A] useful child-rearing resource for the entire family . . . The authors include a fair amount of brain science, but they present it for both adult and child audiences.&#8221;&#8211;Kirkus Reviews    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Strategies for getting a youngster to chill out [with] compassion.&#8221;&#8211;The Washington Post    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;This erudite, tender, and funny book is filled with fresh ideas based on the latest neuroscience research. I urge all parents who want kind, happy, and emotionally healthy kids to read The Whole-Brain Child. This is my new baby gift.&#8221;&#8211;Mary Pipher, Ph.D., author of Reviving Ophelia and The Shelter of Each Other     </p>

<p>                    This book will give an athlete the edge to turn Silver into Gold.    </p>
<p>                    This book will give any child the chance to perform better in exams. Full stop.    </p>
<p>                    How We Learn is a landmark book that shakes up everything we thought we knew about how the brain absorbs and retains information. Filled with powerful &#8211; and often thrillingly counter-intuitive &#8211; wisdom, stories and practical tips, it gets to the very heart of the learning process; and gives us the keys to reach our very fullest potential in every walk of life.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This book is a revelation. I feel as if I&#8217;ve owned a brain for 54 years and only now discovered the operating manual . . . Benedict Carey serves up fascinating, surprising and valuable discoveries with clarity, wit, and heart.&#8217; Mary Roach, bestselling author of Stiff    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Whether you struggle to remember a client&#8217;s name, aspire to learn a new language, or are a student battling to prepare for the next test, this book is a must. I know of no other source that pulls together so much of what we know about the science of memory, and couples it with practical, practicable advice.&#8217;  Daniel T. Willingham, Professor of Psychology, University of Virginia    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Buy this book for yourself and for anyone who wants to learn faster and better.&#8217; Daniel Coyle, bestselling author of The Talent Code    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As fun to read as it is important, and as much about how to live as it is about how to learn. Benedict Carey&#8217;s skills as a writer, plus his willingness to mine his own history as a student, give the book a wonderful narrative quality that makes it all the more accessible &#8211; and all the more effective as a tutorial.&#8217; Robert A. Bjork, Distinguished Professor of Psychology, University of California</p>

<p>                    Clinical psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair takes an in-depth look at how the Internet and the digital revolution are profoundly changing childhood and family dynamics, and offers solutions parents can use to successfully shepherd their children through the technological wilderness.    </p>
<p>                    As the focus of the family has turned to the glow of the screen&#8211;children constantly texting their friends or going online to do homework; parents working online around the clock&#8211;everyday life is undergoing a massive transformation. Easy access to the Internet and social media has erased the boundaries that protect children from damaging exposure to excessive marketing and the unsavory aspects of adult culture. Parents often feel they are losing a meaningful connection with their children. Children are feeling lonely and alienated. The digital world is here to stay, but what are families losing with technology&#8217;s gain?    </p>
<p>                    As renowned clinical psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair explains, families are in crisis as they face this issue, and even more so than they realize. Not only do chronic tech distractions have deep and lasting effects but children also desperately need parents to provide what tech cannot: close, significant interactions with the adults in their lives. Drawing on real-life stories from her clinical work with children and parents and her consulting work with educators and experts across the country, Steiner-Adair offers insights and advice that can help parents achieve greater understanding, authority, and confidence as they engage with the tech revolution unfolding in their living rooms.</p>

Why is a lack of empathy-which goes hand-in-hand with the self-absorption epidemic Dr. Michele Borba calls the Selfie Syndrome-so dangerous? First, it hurts kids&#8217; academic performance and leads to bullying behaviours. Also, it correlates with more cheating and less resilience. And once children grow up, a lack of empathy hampers their ability to collaborate, innovate and problem-solve-all must-have skills for the global economy.<br />
                         In UnSelfie Dr. Borba pinpoints the forces causing the empathy crisis and shares a revolutionary, researched-based, nine-step plan for reversing it. Empathy is a trait that can be taught and nurtured. Dr. Borba offers a framework for parenting that yields the results we all want: successful, happy kids who also are kind, moral, courageous, and resilient. UnSelfie is a blueprint for parents and educators who want to kids shift their focus from I, me, and mine&#8230;to we, us, and ours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s busier, faster society is waging an undeclared war on childhood. With too much stuff, too many choices, and too little time, children can become anxious, have trouble with friends and school, or even be diagnosed with behavioral problems. Now internationally renowned family consultant Kim John Payne helps parents reclaim for their children the space and freedom that all kids need for their attention to deepen and their individuality to flourish. Simplicity Parenting offers inspiration, ideas, and a blueprint for change:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Streamline your home environment. Reduce the amount of toys, books, and clutter&#8211;as well as the lights, sounds, and general sensory overload.<br />
                    &#8211; Establish rhythms and rituals. Discover ways to ease daily tensions, create battle-free mealtimes and bedtimes, and tell if your child is overwhelmed.<br />
                    &#8211; Schedule a break in the schedule. Establish intervals of calm and connection in your child&#8217;s daily torrent of constant doing.<br />
                    &#8211; Scale back on media and parental involvement. Manage your children&#8217;s &#8220;screen time&#8221; to limit the endless deluge of information and stimulation.     </p>
<p>                    A manifesto for protecting the grace of childhood, Simplicity Parenting is an eloquent guide to bringing new rhythms to bear on the lifelong art of raising children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The founder and director of the Thirty Million Words Initiative, Professor Dana Suskind, explains why the most important&#8211;and astoundingly simple&#8211;thing you can do for your child&#8217;s future success in life is to to talk to them.     </p>
<p>                    What nurtures the brain to optimum intelligence and stability?     </p>
<p>                    It is a secret hiding in plain sight: the most important thing we can do for our children is to have conversations with them. The way you talk with your growing child literally builds his or her brain. Parent talk can drastically improve school readiness and lifelong learning in everything from math to art. Indeed, parent-child talk is a fundamental, critical factor in building grit, self-control, leadership skills, and generosity. It is crucial to making the most in life of the luck you have with your genes.     </p>
<p>                    This landmark account of a new scientific perspective describes what works and what doesn&#8217;t (baby talk is fine; relentless correction isn&#8217;t). Discover how to create the best language environments for children by following the simple structure of the Three Ts: Tune In; Talk More; Take Turns. Dr. Suskind and her colleagues around the country have worked with thousands of families; now their insights and successful, measured approaches are available to all.     </p>
<p>                    This is the first book to reveal how and why the first step in nurturing successful lives is talking to children in ways that build their brains. Your family&#8211;and our nation&#8211;need to know.     </p>
<p>                    *Nominated for the Books for a Better Life Award*</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating multi-disciplinary analysis of why curiosity makes the world go round.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A lovely, erudite exploration of what it is that makes us human&#8217; &#8211; Independent on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious&#8217; Albert Einstein.     </p>
<p>                    Everyone is born curious. But only some retain the habits of exploring, learning and discovering as they grow older. Which side of the &#8216;curiosity divide&#8217; are you on?     </p>
<p>                    In Curious Ian Leslie makes a passionate case for the cultivation of our desire to know. Curious people tend to be smarter, more creative and more successful. But at the very moment when the rewards of curiosity have never been higher, it is misunderstood and undervalued, and increasingly practised only by a cognitive elite.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on fascinating research from psychology, sociology and business, Curious looks at what feeds curiosity and what starves it, and uncovers surprising answers. Curiosity isn&#8217;t a quality you can rely on to last a lifetime, but a mental muscle that atrophies without regular exercise. It&#8217;s not a gift, but a habit that parents, schools, workplaces  and individuals need to nurture if it is to thrive. Filled with inspiring stories, case studies and practical advice, Curious will change the way you think about your own mental life, and that of those around you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how TEN habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour &#8211; the NEW book from the creator of the chimp management mind model and author of the million copy selling The Chimp Paradox .    </p>
<p>                    My Hidden Chimp is an effective and powerful new educational book that offers parents, teachers and carers some ideas and thoughts on how to help children to develop healthy habits for life. The science behind the habits is discussed in a practical way with exercises and activities to help children think the habits through and start putting them into practice. The neuroscience of the mind is simplified for children to understand and then use to their advantage.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Steve Peters explains neuroscience in a straightforward and intuitive way &#8211; offering up 10 simple habits that we as adults and children should have in our arsenal to deal with everyday life.    </p>
<p>                    They include:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Smiling<br />
                    &#8211; The importance of talking through your feelings<br />
                    &#8211; Learning how to say sorry<br />
                    &#8211; Knowing how to ask for help    </p>
<p>                    By also explaining the developing &#8216;chimp&#8217; brain in children, he shows us how 10 habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour. These 10 habits should and can be retained for life.    </p>
<p>                    This is an important and another groundbreaking new book from the bestselling author of The Chimp Paradox and the creator of the chimp management mind model.</p>

<p>                     A groundbreaking book on autism, by one of the world&#8217;s leading experts, who portrays autism as a unique way of being human&#8211;this is &#8220;required reading&#8230;.Breathtakingly simple and profoundly positive&#8221; (Chicago Tribune).     </p>
<p>                    Autism therapy typically focuses on ridding individuals of &#8220;autistic&#8221; symptoms such as difficulties interacting socially, problems in communicating, sensory challenges, and repetitive behavior patterns. Now Dr. Barry M. Prizant offers a new and compelling paradigm: the most successful approaches to autism don&#8217;t aim at fixing a person by eliminating symptoms, but rather seeking to understand the individual&#8217;s experience and what underlies the behavior.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A must-read for anyone touched by autism&#8230; Dr. Prizant&#8217;s Uniquely Human is a crucial step in promoting better understanding and a more humane approach&#8221; (Associated Press). Instead of classifying &#8220;autistic&#8221; behaviors as signs of pathology, Dr. Prizant sees them as part of a range of strategies to cope with a world that feels chaotic and overwhelming. Rather than curb these behaviors, it&#8217;s better to enhance abilities, build on strengths, and offer supports that will lead to more desirable behavior and a better quality of life.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A remarkable approach to autism&#8230;.A truly impactful, necessary book&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews, starred review), Uniquely Human offers inspiration and practical advice drawn from Dr. Prizant&#8217;s four-decade career. It conveys a deep respect for people with autism and their own unique qualities. Filled with humanity and wisdom, Uniquely Human &#8220;should reassure parents and caregivers of kids with autism and any other disability that their kids are not broken, but, indeed, special&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though anxiety has risen among young people overall, recent research studies confirm that it has skyrocketed in girls since the turn of the century. So what&#8217;s to blame? And how can we help these girls?    </p>
<p>                    In the same engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first book, Untangled, clinical psychologist Lisa Damour starts by examining the science of stress and anxiety, then turns to the many facets of girls&#8217; lives where stress hits them hard: the parental expectations they face at home, pressures at school, social anxiety among their peers, and on social media. Exploring the multiple layers of girls&#8217; lives, Damour shows us the critical steps we can take to shield them from the toxic stress to which both our culture and also we, as their caregivers, subject them.    </p>
<p>                    Readers familiar with Damour from Untangled or from her New York Times journalism will be drawn to this important new contribution to understanding and supporting today&#8217;s girls &#8211; and tomorrow&#8217;s young women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading clinical psychologist Lisa Damour identifies the seven key phases marking the journey from girlhood to womanhood, and offers practical advice for those raising teenage girls.    </p>
<p>                    We expect an enormous amount from our teenage girls in a world where they are bombarded with messages about how they should look, behave, succeed. Yet we also speak as though adolescence is a nightmare rollercoaster ride for both parent and child, to be endured rather than enjoyed.     </p>
<p>                    In Untangled, world authority and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour provides an accessible, detailed, comprehensive guide to parenting teenage girls. She believes there is a predictable blueprint for how girls grow; seven easily recognisable &#8216;strands&#8217; of transition from childhood through adolescence and on to adulthood. Girls naturally develop at different rates, typically on more than one front, and the transition will be unique to every girl.     </p>
<p>                    Each chapter describes a phase, such as &#8216;contending with adult authority&#8217; and &#8216;entering the romantic world&#8217;, with hints and tips for parents and daughters, and a &#8216;when to worry&#8217; section.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a research neuroscientist, Lise Eliot has made the study of the human brain her life&#8217;s work. But it wasn&#8217;t until she was pregnant with her first child that she became intrigued with the study of brain development. She wanted to know precisely how the baby&#8217;s brain is formed, and when and how each sense, skill, and cognitive ability is developed. And just as important, she was interested in finding out how her role as a nurturer can affect this complex process. How much of her baby&#8217;s development is genetically ordained&#8211;and how much is determined by environment? Is there anything parents can do to make their babies&#8217; brains work better&#8211;to help them become smarter, happier people? Drawing upon the exploding research in this field as well as the stories of real children, What&#8217;s Going On in There? is a lively and thought-provoking book that charts the brain&#8217;s development from conception through the critical first five years. In examining the many factors that play crucial roles in that process, What&#8217;s Going On in There? explores the evolution of the senses, motor skills, social and emotional behaviors, and mental functions such as attention, language, memory, reasoning, and intelligence. This remarkable book also discusses:     </p>
<p>                     how a baby&#8217;s brain is &#8220;assembled&#8221; from scratch<br />
                    the critical prenatal factors that shapebrain development<br />
                    how the birthing process itself affects the brain<br />
                    which forms of stimulation are most effective at promoting cognitive development<br />
                    how boys&#8217; and girls&#8217; brains develop differently<br />
                    how nutrition, stress, and other physical and social factors can permanently affect a child&#8217;s brain     </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly blending cutting-edge science with a mother&#8217;s wisdom and insight, What&#8217;s Going On in There? is an invaluable contribution to the nature versus nurture debate. Children&#8217;s development is determined both by the genes they are born with and the richness of their early environment. This timely and important book shows parents the innumerable ways in which they can actually help their children grow better brains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does your personality shape your life ,  and what, if anything, can you do about it?Are you hardwired for happiness, or born to brood? Do you think you&#8217;re in charge of your future, or do you surf the waves of unknowable fate? Would you be happier, or just less socially adept, if you were less concerned about what other people thought of you? And what about your  Type A&#8221; spouse: is he or she destined to have a heart attack, or just drive you to drink?In the past few decades, new scientific research has transformed old ideas about the nature of human personality. Neuroscientists, biologists, and psychological scientists have reexamined the theories of Freud and Jung as well as the humanistic psychologies of the 1960s, upending the simplistic categorizations of personality  types,&#8221; and developing new tools and methods for exploring who we are. Renowned professor and pioneering research psychologist Brian R. Little has been at the leading edge of this new science. In this wise and witty book he shares a wealth of new data and provocative insights about who we are, why we act the way we do, what we can,and can&#8217;t,change, and how we can best thrive in light of our  nature.&#8221; Me, Myself, and Us  explores questions that are rooted in the origins of human consciousness but are as commonplace as yesterday&#8217;s breakfast conversation, such as whether our personality traits are  set&#8221; by age thirty or whether our brains and selves are more plastic. He considers what our personalities portend for our health and success, and the extent to which our well-being depends on the personal projects we pursue.Through stories, studies, personal experiences, and entertaining interactive assessments,  Me, Myself, and Us  provides a lively, thought-provoking, and ultimately optimistic look at the possibilities and perils of being uniquely ourselves, while illuminating the selves of the familiar strangers we encounter, work with, and love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;courageous, compassionate, and rigorous every-person&#8217;s guide&#8221; (Christina Bethell, PhD, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) that shows the link between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)  and diseases, and how to cope and heal from these emotional traumas.    </p>
<p>                    Your biography becomes your biology. The emotional trauma we suffer as children not only shapes our emotional lives as adults, but it also affects our physical health, longevity, and overall well-being. Scientists now know on a bio-chemical level exactly how parents&#8217; chronic fights, divorce, death in the family, being bullied or hazed, and growing up with a hypercritical, alcoholic, or mentally ill parent can leave permanent, physical &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; on our brains.    </p>
<p>                    When children encounter sudden or chronic adversity, stress hormones cause powerful changes in the body, altering the body&#8217;s chemistry. The developing immune system and brain react to this chemical barrage by permanently resetting children&#8217;s stress response to &#8220;high,&#8221; which in turn can have a devastating impact on their mental and physical health as they grow up.    </p>
<p>                    Donna Jackson Nakazawa shares stories from people who have recognized and overcome their adverse experiences, shows why some children are more immune to stress than others, and explains why women are at particular risk. &#8220;Groundbreaking&#8221; (Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance) in its research, inspiring in its clarity, Childhood Disrupted explains how you can reset your biology-and help your loved ones find ways to heal. &#8220;A truly important gift of understanding-illuminates the heartbreaking costs of childhood trauma and like good medicine offers the promising science of healing and prevention&#8221; (Jack Kornfield, author of A Path With Heart).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The struggle to understand the infant-parent bond ranks as one of the great quests of modern psychology, one that touches us deeply because it holds so many clues to how we become who we are. How are our personalities formed? How do our early struggles with our parents reappear in the way we relate to others as adults? Why do we repeat with our own children&#8211;seemingly against our will&#8211;the very behaviors we most disliked about our parents? In Becoming Attached, psychologist and noted journalist Robert Karen offers fresh insight into some of the most fundamental and fascinating questions of emotional life.<br />
                     Karen begins by tracing the history of attachment theory through the controversial work of John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst, and Mary Ainsworth, an American developmental psychologist, who together launched a revolution in child psychology. Karen tells about their personal and professional struggles, their groundbreaking discoveries, and the recent flowering of attachment theory research in universities all over the world, making it one of the century&#8217;s most enduring ideas in developmental psychology.<br />
                     In a world of working parents and makeshift day care, the need to assess the impact of parenting styles and the bond between child and caregiver is more urgent than ever. Karen addresses such issues as: What do children need to feel that the world is a positive place and that they have value? Is day care harmful for children under one year? What experiences in infancy will enable a person to develop healthy relationships as an adult?, and he demonstrates how different approaches to mothering are associated with specific infant behaviors, such as clinginess, avoidance, or secure exploration. He shows how these patterns become ingrained and how they reveal themselves at age two, in the preschool years, in middle childhood, and in adulthood. And, with thought-provoking insights, he gives us a new understanding of how negative patterns and insecure attachment can be changed and resolved throughout a person&#8217;s life.<br />
                     The infant is in many ways a great mystery to us. Every one of us has been one; many of us have lived with or raised them. Becoming Attached is not just a voyage of discovery in child emotional development and its pertinence to adult life but a voyage of personal discovery as well, for it is impossible to read this book without reflecting on one&#8217;s own life as a child, a parent, and an intimate partner in love or marriage.</p>

<p>                    Debunks the idea that aging inevitably brings infirmity and unhappiness and instead offers a trove of practical, evidence-based guidance for living longer and better.<br />
                    &#8211;Daniel H. Pink, author of When and Drive     </p>
<p>                    SUCCESSFUL AGING delivers powerful insights:<br />
                     &#8211; Debunking the myth that memory always declines with age<br />
                     &#8211; Confirming that health span&#8211;not life span&#8211;is what matters<br />
                     &#8211; Proving that sixty-plus years is a unique and newly recognized developmental stage<br />
                     &#8211; Recommending that people look forward to joy, as reminiscing doesn&#8217;t promote health     </p>
<p>                     Levitin looks at the science behind what we all can learn from those who age joyously, as well as how to adapt our culture to take full advantage of older people&#8217;s wisdom and experience. Throughout his exploration of what aging really means, using research from developmental neuroscience and the psychology of individual differences, Levitin reveals resilience strategies and practical, cognitive- enhancing tricks everyone should do as they age.     </p>
<p>                     Successful Aging inspires a powerful new approach to how readers think about our final decades, and it will revolutionize the way we plan for old age as individuals, family members, and citizens within a society where the average life expectancy continues to rise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

<p>                    Highlighting the fascinating link between a child&#8217;s neurological development and the way a parent reacts to misbehavior, No-Drama Discipline provides an effective, compassionate road map for dealing with tantrums, tensions, and tears&#8211;without causing a scene.     </p>

By doing so, the cycle of negative behavior (and punishment) is essentially brought to a halt, as problem solving becomes a win/win situation. Inside this sanity-saving guide you&#8217;ll discover     </p>

                     &#8211; facts on child brain development&#8211;and what kind of discipline is most appropriate and constructive at all ages and stages<br />
                     &#8211; the way to calmly and lovingly connect with a child&#8211;no matter how extreme the behavior&#8211;while still setting clear and consistent limits<br />
                     &#8211; tips for navigating your child through a tantrum to achieve insight, empathy, and repair<br />
                     &#8211; twenty discipline mistakes even the best parents make&#8211;and how to stay focused on the principles of whole-brain parenting and discipline techniques     </p>
<p>                     Complete with candid stories and playful illustrations that bring the authors&#8217; suggestions to life, No-Drama Discipline shows you how to work with your child&#8217;s developing mind, peacefully resolve conflicts, and inspire happiness and strengthen resilience in everyone in the family.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the parenting information out there and the constant pressure to be the &#8220;perfect&#8221; parent, it seems as if many parents have lost track of one very important piece of the parenting puzzle: raising happy kids.     </p>
<p>                     Parenting today has gotten far too complicated. It&#8217;s never been the easiest job in the world, but with all the &#8220;parenting advice&#8221; parents are met with at every corner, it&#8217;s hard not to become bewildered. It seems that in the past it was a good deal simpler. You made sure there was dinner on the table and the kids got to school on time and no one set anything on fire, and you called it a success. But today everybody has a different method for dealing with the madness&#8211;attachment parenting, free-range parenting, mindful parenting. And who is to say one is more right or better than another? How do you choose?     </p>
<p>                     The truth is that whatever drumbeat you march to, all parents would agree that we just want our kids to be happy. It seems like a no-brainer, right? But in the face of all the many parenting theories out there, happiness feels like it has become incidental. That&#8217;s where The Happy Kid Handbook by child and adolescent psychotherapist and parenting expert Katie Hurley comes in. She shows parents how happiness is the key to raising confident, capable children. It&#8217;s not about giving in every time your child wants something so they won&#8217;t feel bad when you say no, or making sure that they&#8217;re taking that art class, and the ballet class, and the soccer class (to help with their creativity and their coordination and all that excess energy). Happiness is about parenting the individual, because not every child is the same, and not every child will respond to parenting the same way. By exploring the differences among introverts, extroverts, and everything in between, this definitive guide to parenting offers parents the specific strategies they need to meet their child exactly where he or she needs to be met from a social-emotional perspective. A back-to-basics guide to parenting, The Happy Kid Handbook is a must-have for any parent hoping to be the best parent they can be.</p>

<p>                    Lydia Denworth&#8217;s third son, Alex, was nearly two when he was identified with significant hearing loss that was likely to get worse. Denworth knew the importance of enrichment to the developing brain but had never contemplated the opposite: deprivation. How would a child&#8217;s brain grow outside the world of sound? How would he communicate? Would he learn to read and write?    </p>
<p>                    An acclaimed science journalist as well as a mother, Denworth made it her mission to find out, interviewing experts on language development, inventors of groundbreaking technology, Deaf leaders, and neuroscientists at the frontiers of brain plasticity research. I Can Hear You Whisper chronicles Denworth&#8217;s search for answers-and her new understanding of Deaf culture and the exquisite relationship between sound, language, and learning.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;Gripping&#8230;how can teachers snatch back their critical role and give children the necessary space to fail? They could start by making parents read Lahey.&#8221; &#8212; New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Paul Tough&#8217;s How Children Succeed and Wendy Mogel&#8217;s The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, this groundbreaking manifesto focuses on the critical school years when parents must learn to allow their children to experience the disappointment and frustration that occur from life&#8217;s inevitable problems so that they can grow up to be successful, resilient, and self-reliant adults.    </p>
<p>                    Modern parenting is defined by an unprecedented level of overprotectiveness: parents who rush to school at the whim of a phone call to deliver forgotten assignments, who challenge teachers on report card disappointments, mastermind children&#8217;s friendships, and interfere on the playing field. As teacher and writer Jessica Lahey explains, even though these parents see themselves as being highly responsive to their children&#8217;s well being, they aren&#8217;t giving them the chance to experience failure&#8211;or the opportunity to learn to solve their own problems.    </p>
<p>                    Overparenting has the potential to ruin a child&#8217;s confidence and undermine their education, Lahey reminds us. Teachers don&#8217;t just teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. They teach responsibility, organization, manners, restraint, and foresight&#8211;important life skills children carry with them long after they leave the classroom.    </p>
<p>                    Providing a path toward solutions, Lahey lays out a blueprint with targeted advice for handling homework, report cards, social dynamics, and sports. Most importantly, she sets forth a plan to help parents learn to step back and embrace their children&#8217;s failures. Hard-hitting yet warm and wise, The Gift of Failure is essential reading for parents, educators, and psychologists nationwide who want to help children succeed.</p>
