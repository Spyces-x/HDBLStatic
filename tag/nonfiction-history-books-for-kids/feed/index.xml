										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each of the books in Nathan Hale&#8217;s Hazardous Tales has elements of the strange but true and is presented in an engaging, funny format, highlighting the larger-than-life characters that pop up in real history. Big Bad Ironclad! covers the history of the amazing ironclad steam warships used in the Civil War.From the ship&#8217;s inventor, who had a history of blowing things up and only 100 days to complete his project, to the mischievous William Cushing, who pranked his way through the whole war, this book is filled with surprisingly true facts and funny, brave characters that modern readers will easily relate to.Praise for Nathan Hale&#8217;s Hazardous Tales: Big Bad Ironclad&#8221;Livelier than the typical history textbook but sillier than the many outstanding works on the Civil War available for young readers, this will appeal to both history buffs and graphic-novel enthusiasts.&#8221;-Kirkus Reviews&#8221;Readers interested in American history will enjoy these graphic novels&#8230; Comic panels of varying sizes enhance the real-life events and support the stories&#8217; over-the-top humor&#8230; the writing is accessible and entertaining; author Hale&#8217;s style gives readers an insider-y, you-are-there-type scoop.&#8221;-Horn BookAward:New York Public Library&#8217;s Children&#8217;s Books 2012: 100 Books for Reading and Sharing list    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    In this remarkable memoir &#8211; written with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger during her pivotal first years of rebirth &#8211; Caitlyn Jenner reflects on her past as she looks to her future.     </p>
<p>                    With poignancy and humour, Caitlyn writes about her confusion growing up, the temporary triumph of the Olympics as Bruce Jenner, and the noose of being endlessly described as the ultimate in manhood. She reveals her sense of shame and deceit she felt as she got older, as she went to great lengths to tell lies to conceal her true self. She also delves into her life in the public eye; her marriages and her troubled relationships with her children; what lead to her decision to becoming Caitlyn, and how the transgender community and the world has embraced her new life. Written with a searing honesty, this books shows you the real and true Caitlyn.</p>
