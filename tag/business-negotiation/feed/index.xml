										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>President Donald J. Trump lays out his professional and personal worldview in this classic work&#8211;a firsthand account of the rise of America&#8217;s foremost deal-maker. </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I like thinking big. I always have. To me it&#8217;s very simple: If you&#8217;re going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think big.&#8221;&#8211;Donald J. Trump </p>
<p>                    Here is Trump in action&#8211;how he runs his organization and how he runs his life&#8211;as he meets the people he needs to meet, chats with family and friends, clashes with enemies, and challenges conventional thinking. But even a maverick plays by rules, and Trump has formulated time-tested guidelines for success. He isolates the common elements in his greatest accomplishments; he shatters myths; he names names, spells out the zeros, and fully reveals the deal-maker&#8217;s art. And throughout, Trump talks&#8211;really talks&#8211;about how he does it. Trump: The Art of the Deal is an unguarded look at the mind of a brilliant entrepreneur&#8211;the ultimate read for anyone interested in the man behind the spotlight. </p>
<p>                     Praise for Trump: The Art of the Deal </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again.&#8221;&#8211;The New York Times  </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Donald Trump is a deal maker. He is a deal maker the way lions are carnivores and water is wet.&#8221;&#8211;Chicago Tribune</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Fascinating . . . wholly absorbing . . . conveys Trump&#8217;s larger-than-life demeanor so vibrantly that the reader&#8217;s attention is instantly and fully claimed.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Herald</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A chatty, generous, chutzpa-filled autobiography.&#8221;&#8211;New York Post</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobbing is a destructive social process in which individuals, groups, or organizations target a person for ridicule, humiliation, and removal from the workplace. It can lead to deteriorating physical and mental health, workplace violence, and even suicide. Studies indicate that as many as 37% of American workers have experienced workplace abuse at some time in their working lives.    </p>
<p>                    Overcoming Mobbing is an informative, comprehensive guidebook written for the victims of mobbing and their families who often can&#8217;t make sense of the experience or mobilize resources for recovery. In an engaging, reader-friendly style, the book distinguishes mobbing from bullying in that it takes place within organizational or institutional settings and involves organizational dynamics. Mobbing is not about the occasional negative experience at work; it is ongoing negative acts, both<br />
                    overt and covert, over time, that erode workers&#8217; confidence in themselves and in their workplaces and that no amount of sophistication or maturity can make sense of.  Duffy and Sperry, leading authorities on this special type of aggression, provide effective strategies for recovery from mobbing as well as for<br />
                    prevention, and they demystify the experience through the use of case vignettes. More than a simple self-help book, this volume brings the concept and terminology relating to mobbing into the public vocabulary by virtue of its strong foundation in psychological and organizational research. It offers a detailed presentation of the causes and consequences of mobbing, helps readers avoid falling into the trap of misplacing blame, and holds organizations at the center of responsibility for<br />
                    preventing the abuse. In addition to those who have experienced mobbing themselves, this book is an invaluable resource for workplace managers and human resources personnel who wish to prevent or reverse mobbing within their own professional settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rejection? It&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of &#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Maybe you avoid situations where you might be rejected. You don&#8217;t apply for that dream job. You don&#8217;t ask for that pay rise. You don&#8217;t ask that person on a date. But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way &#8211; the only thing standing between you and your goals &#8230; is you.     </p>
<p>                    Jia Jiang had allowed his fear of rejection to rule his life. But he decided to take radical action: he quit his job and spent 100 days deliberately seeking out scenarios where he would likely be rejected, from ordering donuts interlinked and iced like the Olympic rings to asking to pilot a light aircraft. And something remarkable happened; Jia not only learned how to cope with rejection but also discovered that even the most outrageous request may be granted &#8211; if you ask in the right way.    </p>
<p>                    In this infectiously positive book Jia shares what he learned in his 100 Days of Rejection, explaining how to turn a &#8216;no&#8217; into a &#8216;yes&#8217;, and revealing how you too can become Rejection Proof and achieve your dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if you could combine the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization?    </p>
<p>                    When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Iraq in 2003, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment and training &#8211; but none of the enemy&#8217;s speed and flexibility.    </p>
<p>                    McChrystal and his colleagues discarded a century of conventional wisdom to create a &#8216;team of teams&#8217; that combined extremely transparent communication with decentralized decision-making authority.     </p>
<p>                    Faster, flatter and more flexible, the task force beat back al-Qaeda.    </p>
<p>                    In this powerful book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be relevant to any leader. Through compelling examples, the authors demonstrate that the &#8216;team of teams&#8217; strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency rooms to NASA and has the potential to transform organizations large and small.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A bold argument that leaders can help teams become greater than the sum of their parts&#8217; Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it makes more sense to lose today in order to win tomorrow. What do you do when you know what you want, but you have no idea how to get it?    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;The greatest negotiation book of all time.&#8217; Inc. Magazine<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Never walk away. Learn to listen, then learn to understand, then learn to win.    </p>
<p>                    Negotiation is part of every human encounter, and most of us do it badly. Whether dealing with family, a business, or diplomacy, people often fail to meet their goals in every country and context. They focus on power and &#8220;win-win&#8221; instead of relationships and perceptions. They don&#8217;t find enough things to trade. They think others should be rational when they should be dealing with emotions. They get distracted from their goals.    </p>
<p>                    In this revolutionary and seminal bestselling book, leading negotiation practitioner, coach and professor Stuart Diamond shows how emotional intelligence, perceptions, cultural diversity and collaboration produce four times as much value as old-school, conflictive, power, leverage and logic. Drawing on thirty-plus years of research involving 30,000 people across 45 countries &#8211; ranging from political and corporate leaders to administrative assistants, lawyers, housewives, students, and labourers &#8211; he outlines specific, practical and better ways to deal with others. To this, he adds his 40-year experience as a corporate executive, Harvard-trained attorney, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.    </p>
<p>                    Getting More is based on Professor Diamond&#8217;s award-winning negotiations course at The Wharton Business School, where it has been the most sought-after course by students for almost two decades. It contains a powerful toolkit that can be used in any situation: with kids and jobs, travel and shopping, business, politics, relationships, cultures, partners and competitors. His advice is brought to life in an accessible and entertaining manner through the stories of hundreds of people who have used the toolkit with great success.<br />

<p>                     &#8216;From advising on how to negotiate with terrorists, to industrial disputes, to children, Diamond&#8217;s twelve rules of negotiation promise to open new doors every day.&#8217; Radio One    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We use money to solve our everyday problems, and it generally works well. Despite its economic benefits, however, money has a psychological downside: it trains us to think about negotiations narrow-mindedly, leading us to negotiate badly. Suggesting that we need a non-monetary mindset to negotiate better, The Bartering Mindset shows us how to look outside the monetary economy &#8211; to the bartering economies of the past, where people traded what they had for what they needed. The book argues that, because of the economic difficulties associated with bartering, barterers had to use a more sophisticated form of negotiation &#8211; a strategic approach that can make us master negotiators today.    </p>
<p>                    This book immerses readers in the assumptions made by barterers, collectively referred to as the &#8220;bartering mindset,&#8221; and then demonstrates how to apply this mindset to modern, monetary negotiations. The Bartering Mindset concludes that our individual, organizational, and social problems fester for a predictable reason: we apply a monetary mindset to our negotiations, leading to suboptimal thinking, counterproductive behaviors, and disappointing outcomes. By offering the bartering mindset as an alternative, this book will help people negotiate better and thrive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine your advantage in negotiations, decision-making, and leadership if you could teach yourself to see and evaluate information that others overlook. The Power of Noticing provides the blueprint for accomplishing precisely that. Max Bazerman, an expert in the field of applied behavioral psychology, draws on three decades of research and his experience instructing Harvard Business School MBAs and corporate executives to teach you how to notice and act on information that may not be immediately obvious.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on a wealth of real-world examples and using many of the same case studies and thought experiments designed in his executive MBA classes, Bazerman challenges you to explore your cognitive blind spots, identify any salient details you are programmed to miss, and then take steps to ensure it won&#8217;t happen again. His book provides a step-by-step guide to breaking bad habits and spotting the hidden details that will change your decision-making and leadership skills for the better, teaching you to pay attention to what didn&#8217;t happen, acknowledge self-interest, invent the third choice, and realize that what you see is not all there is.     </p>
<p>                    While many bestselling business books have explained how susceptible to manipulation our irrational cognitive blind spots make us, Bazerman helps you avoid the habits that lead to poor decisions and ineffective leadership in the first place. With The Power of Noticing at your side, you can learn how to notice what others miss, make wiser decisions, and lead more successfully.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An invaluable resource for making sense of the world, making good decisions, and placing smart bets. A fast-paced and fun read jam-packed with useful information on every page.&#8217; Annie Duke, author of Thinking in Bets<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Turn yourself into a superthinker and make the right decisions every time.    </p>
<p>                     You want to make better decisions. You want to be right more of the time professionally and personally. However, being more right consistently is a hard problem because the world is such a complex, evolving place. How do you navigate this complexity?    </p>
<p>                     Mental models are decision-making tools that guide our perception of the world and our behaviour in it. They help us understand life, make decisions and solve problems. The best models help us make intelligent investments, develop ground-breaking technologies and even travel to outer space.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Note your frame of reference before debating someone with different political views. If you understand how your perspective contrasts with someone else&#8217;s you can prevent the conversation from getting hostile.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Apply the sunk cost fallacy to the end of a doomed project. Just because you&#8217;ve put a lot of hours into it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to keep going.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Before blaming someone, consider Hanlon&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Try to solve mysteries with Occam&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected&#8217;. When you hear hoof beats, think of horses not zebras.    </p>
<p>                     Building on our knowledge of well-known models such as the Bandwagon Effect or Paradigm Shift and introducing us to the lesser known like the Eisenhower Matrix or the Boiling Frog Symbol, this indispensable book distils the most effective mental models into a single, digestible volume. It will make even the most complex models accessible and engaging to enable you to make better, more informed decisions in every part of your life.<br />
                     ________________    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Internalizing these mental models will help you understand the world around you. Once you can spot them, you can change your own behavior to avoid common traps, adjust how you interact with people to get better results, and maybe even articulate new mental models of the world that have yet to be discovered.&#8217; Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO, Coinbase    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;You can&#8217;t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts. If the facts don&#8217;t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don&#8217;t have them in a usable form. You&#8217;ve got to have models in your head.&#8217; Charlie Munger, vice chairman, Berkshire Hathaway</p>

<p>                    We get feedback every day of our lives, from friends and family, colleagues, customers, and bosses, teachers, doctors, and strangers. We&#8217;re assessed, coached, and criticized about our performance, personalities and appearance.    </p>
<p>                    We know that feedback is essential for professional development and healthy relationships &#8211; but we dread it and even dismiss it. That&#8217;s because while want to learn and grow, we also want to be accepted just as we are.    </p>
<p>                    Thanks for the Feedback is the first book to address this tension head on. In it, the world-renowned team behind the Harvard Negotiation Project offer a simple framework and powerful tools, showing us how to take on life&#8217;s blizzard of comments and advice with curiosity and grace.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I&#8217;ll admit it: Thanks for the Feedback made me uncomfortable. And that&#8217;s one reason I liked it so much. With keen insight and lots of practical takeaways, it reveals why getting feedback is so hard &#8211; and then how we can do better&#8217;  Daniel H. Pink, author of To Sell Is Human and Drive    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Negotiation is fundamental to our lives; whether it&#8217;s getting your kids to eat their greens, making your case for a pay rise, or trying to secure a multi-million pound deal for your company.     </p>
<p>                    However, negotiation has changed. It&#8217;s no longer about confrontation where there are winners and losers. Collaboration is now the name of the game. YouGov research commissioned for this book shows UK PLC is losing GBP9 million per hour from poor negotiating &#8211; GBP17 billion per year. Can you afford to be without a modern framework for deal-making?    </p>
<p>                    In The Yes Book, Clive Rich provides a method for generating success based on years of experience working for or with major organisations and super brands including Sony, Yahoo, Apple, the BBC, Tesco, and Simon Cowell&#8217;s Syco, during a negotiating career in which he has brokered more than GBP10 billion worth of deals.     </p>
<p>                    By breaking negotiation into its three key elements of Attitude, Behaviour and Process, he helps you learn how to shape, create and close deals. You will discover what your negotiating style is, and how you can apply it to influence others and give yourself the edge.    </p>
<p>                    This is the ultimate guide to using the power of negotiation to get more of what you want, in both business and life outside the office.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the most important books of our modern era&#8221; -Amb. Jaime de Bourbon    </p>
<p>                    For anyone struggling with conflict, this book can transform you. Negotiating the Nonnegotiable takes you on a journey into the heart and soul of conflict, providing unique insight into the emotional undercurrents that too often sweep us out to sea. With vivid stories of his closed-door sessions with warring political groups, disputing businesspeople, and families in crisis, Daniel Shapiro presents a universally applicable method to successfully navigate conflict.  A deep, provocative book to reflect on and wrestle with, this book can change your life.    </p>
<p>                     Be warned: This book is not a quick fix. Real change takes work. You will learn how to master five emotional dynamics that can sabotage conflict outside your awareness:    </p>
<p>                    1. Vertigo: How can you avoid      getting emotionally consumed in conflict?<br />
                    2. Repetition compulsion: How can you stop      repeating the same conflicts again and again?<br />
                    3. Taboos: How can you discuss      sensitive issues at the heart of the conflict?<br />
                    4. Assault on the sacred: What should you do if      your values feel threatened?<br />
                    5. Identity politics: What can you do if      others use politics against you?     </p>
<p>                    In our era of discontent, this is just the book we need to resolve conflict in our own lives and in the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Harvard Business Review asked Robert Sutton for suggestions for its annual list of Breakthrough Ideas, he told them that the best business practice he knew of was &#8216;the no asshole rule&#8217;. Sutton&#8217;s piece became one of the most popular articles ever to appear in the HBR. Spurred on by the fear and despair that people expressed, the tricks they used to survive with dignity in asshole-infested places, the revenge stories that made him laugh out loud and the other small wins that they celebrated against mean-spirited people, Sutton was persuaded to write THE NO ASSHOLE RULE.<br />
                    He believes passionately that civilised workplaces are not a naive dream, that they do exist, do bolster performance and that widespread contempt can be erased and replaced with mutual respect when a team or organisation is managed right. There is a huge temptation by executives and those in positions of authority to overlook this trait especially when exhibited by so-called producers, but Sutton shows how overall productivity suffers when the workplace is subjected to this kind of stress.</p>

<p>                    A member of the world-renowned Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School introduces the powerful next-generation approach to negotiation.     </p>
<p>                    For many years, two approaches to negotiation have prevailed: the &#8220;win-win&#8221; method exemplified in Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher, William Ury, and Bruce Patton; and the hard-bargaining style of Herb Cohen&#8217;s You Can Negotiate Anything. Now award-winning Harvard Business School professor Michael Wheeler provides a dynamic alternative to one-size-fits-all strategies that don&#8217;t match real world realities.     </p>
<p>                    The Art of Negotiation shows how master negotia-tors thrive in the face of chaos and uncertainty. They don&#8217;t trap themselves with rigid plans. Instead they understand negotiation as a process of exploration that demands ongoing learning, adapting, and influencing. Their agility enables them to reach agreement when others would be stalemated.     </p>
<p>                    Michael Wheeler illuminates the improvisational nature of negotiation, drawing on his own research and his work with Program on Negotiation colleagues. He explains how the best practices of diplomats such as George J. Mitchell, dealmaker Bruce Wasserstein, and Hollywood producer Jerry Weintraub apply to everyday transactions like selling a house, buying a car, or landing a new contract. Wheeler also draws lessons on agility and creativity from fields like jazz, sports, theater, and even military science.</p>
