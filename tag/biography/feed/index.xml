										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This inspirational New York Times bestseller chronicles the lifelong friendship between a busy sales executive and a disadvantaged young boy, and how both of their lives were changed by what began as one small gesture of kindness.     </p>
<p>                    Stopping was never part of the plan&#8230;     </p>
<p>                     She was a successful ad sales rep in Manhattan. He was a homeless, eleven-year-old panhandler on the street. He asked for spare change; she kept walking. But then something stopped her in her tracks, and she went back. And she continued to go back, again and again. They met up nearly every week for years and built an unexpected, life-changing friendship that has today spanned almost three decades.     </p>
<p>                     Whatever made me notice him on that street corner so many years ago is clearly something that cannot be extinguished, no matter how relentless the forces aligned against it. Some may call it spirit. Some may call it heart. It drew me to him, as if we were bound by some invisible, unbreakable thread. And whatever it is, it binds us still.</p>

<p>                     From the acclaimed, award-winning author of Alexander Hamilton here is the essential, endlessly engrossing biography of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.&#8211;the Jekyll-and-Hyde of American capitalism. In the course of his nearly 98 years, Rockefeller was known as both a rapacious robber baron, whose Standard Oil Company rode roughshod over an industry, and a philanthropist who donated money lavishly to universities and medical centers. He was the terror of his competitors, the bogeyman of reformers, the delight of caricaturists&#8211;and an utter enigma.     </p>
<p>                     Drawing on unprecedented access to Rockefeller&#8217;s private papers, Chernow reconstructs his subjects&#8217; troubled origins (his father was a swindler and a bigamist) and his single-minded pursuit of wealth. But he also uncovers the profound religiosity that drove him &#8220;to give all I could&#8221;; his devotion to his father; and the wry sense of humor that made him the country&#8217;s most colorful codger. Titan is a magnificent biography&#8211;balanced, revelatory, elegantly written.</p>
