										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fourth novel in the #1 New York Times and #1 USA Today bestselling Crossfire series.     </p>
<p>                    Gideon calls me his angel, but he&#8217;s the miracle in my life. My gorgeous, wounded warrior, so determined to slay my demons while refusing to face his own.     </p>
<p>                     The vows we&#8217;d exchanged should have bound us tighter than blood and flesh. Instead they opened old wounds, exposed pain and insecurities, and lured bitter enemies out of the shadows. I felt him slipping from my grasp, my greatest fears becoming my reality, my love tested in ways I wasn&#8217;t sure I was strong enough to bear.     </p>
<p>                     At the brightest time in our lives, the darkness of his past encroached and threatened everything we&#8217;d worked so hard for. We faced a terrible choice: the familiar safety of the lives we&#8217;d had before each other or the fight for a future that suddenly seemed an impossible and hopeless dream&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The ice is a cold mistress. As the league&#8217;s most eligible goalie, Max Fournier has access to his fair share of willing puck bunnies, but right now he&#8217;s more interested in bringing home another championship than a one-night stand. A romantic at heart, Max believes in love; he&#8217;s just not great at relationships. So when he finally meets a nice girl who&#8217;s not blinded by his celebrity, he&#8217;s feeling the heat&#8211;and the pressure to save her from herself. Between working two jobs and raising her sister&#8217;s kids, Julianne Bradley doesn&#8217;t have time for sports&#8211;or men. All she knows about Max is that he&#8217;s the sexiest customer to ever grace her gas-station counter. And he sees past her tired eyes and makes Jules yearn for things she can&#8217;t have: a glamorous fling, a passionate lover, and the time to enjoy both. Max makes her feel like Cinderella, even though Jules has enough baggage to crush a glass slipper. Luckily, he&#8217;s no prince&#8211;only a fierce competitor determined to win her heart.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marek Fabritis is used to delivering blows, not receiving them. But when he gets tipped off by an anonymous email about his ex-girlfriend, the news leaves him ice cold-and it&#8217;s not because Gracen Moore is getting married to a total jerk. It&#8217;s the fact that Marek has a three-year-old daughter he never knew about. Now he&#8217;s going back home, not to play knight in shining armor but to make damn sure that no man takes what&#8217;s his. For the first time, there might be something more important than hockey. Gracen Moore has always loved Marek. That&#8217;s why she let him go, so he could pursue a career in the NHL. And that&#8217;s why she never told him about Lilly. Only now does Gracen realize that she made an unforgivable mistake. But is that any reason for Marek to crash her wedding and make an epic scene? If the spark that still smolders between them is to be trusted, maybe. Still, Gracen&#8217;s not getting her hopes up. Because she knows better than anyone that appearances aren&#8217;t always what they seem . . . Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a league full of troublemakers, Cold Fury defenseman Roman Sýkora stands out&#8211;at least when it comes to negative publicity. When he&#8217;s not chilling in the penalty box, the sizzling Czech skate demon is racking up tabloid headlines for his scandalous behavior with the ladies. But now Roman&#8217;s feeling the burn from management to clean up his act, or else. Luckily he&#8217;s got an enticing distraction: a fun-loving barista who plays the ukulele and brings out a side of Roman he didn&#8217;t know he had. Lexi Robertson came to Raleigh, North Carolina, to finally meet her father, Brian Brannon, and her half sister, Gray, both of whom work in the Cold Fury&#8217;s front office. That&#8217;s where she first meets sexy, intimidating Roman&#8211;who&#8217;s really a big softie at heart. As one relationship takes off, another begins: Brian seems to be clicking with Lexi&#8217;s boss at the coffee shop. But when the friction between Roman and her new family heats up, Lexi wonders whether she&#8217;s a pawn in their game. Feeling hurt and foolish, Lexi&#8217;s ready to quit while she&#8217;s ahead. Trouble is, Roman&#8217;s not ready to quit on her.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carolina Cold Fury star Garrett Samuelson never wants to miss out on a single minute of fun. Whether he&#8217;s playing hockey, hanging out with friends, or walking the red carpet with a new date on his arm, he lives every day to the fullest. When he meets Olivia Case, he sees someone who&#8217;s exactly his type&#8211;confident, sexy, and smart. But the more he pursues her, the more Garrett shares a side of himself that other women don&#8217;t normally get to see. Olivia has been keeping a secret. She&#8217;s undergoing treatment for some serious medical issues, and she doesn&#8217;t have time for a relationship with no guarantees&#8211;especially one with a hot-as-sin womanizer who won&#8217;t take no for an answer. But as she gets to know the real Garrett, Olivia can&#8217;t help falling for him . . . hard. To reveal the truth would mean risking everything&#8211;but you can&#8217;t score without taking the tough shots.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Off the ice, elite defenseman Hawke Therrien enjoys his fair share of booze and good times. And why shouldn&#8217;t he? He&#8217;s worked his way up from the minor leagues and made himself a star. The only thing Hawke misses from that life is the pierced, tattooed free spirit who broke his heart without so much as an explanation. She&#8217;s almost unrecognizable when she walks back into his life seven years later, except for the look in her eyes that feels like a punch to the gut. Vale Campbell isn&#8217;t the same girl she was at twenty. As crazy as she was about Hawke, her reckless behavior and out-of-control drinking were starting to scare her. She had to clean up her act, and that would never happen with Hawke around. Cutting him loose was the hardest thing Vale ever had to do&#8211;until now. Because she&#8217;s still crazy about Hawke, and if he could ever learn to forgive her, they just might have a future together.Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one plays like Reed Olson, whether it&#8217;s hockey season or not. After back-to-back NHL championships, he&#8217;s craving a little R&#038;R. Reed leans to a specific type&#8211;blond, busty, and interested&#8211;and fortunately he has a little black book full of options. So why is it he can&#8217;t stop dreaming about the new girl who just moved in next door? A certified brainiac, she seems to want nothing to do with the hard-bodied athlete. Josie Ives desperately needs something her celebrity neighbor obviously doesn&#8217;t: solitude. Reed is everything she imagined&#8211;a little too good-looking, with a body that puts Greek gods to shame. But she didn&#8217;t expect he would also be funny and charming. Josie knows she&#8217;s the opposite of his type, and that&#8217;s fine with her. Still, the chemistry between them is undeniable. Their newfound friendship certainly has its benefits, but she&#8217;s starting to wonder if opposites really do attract. Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of the league&#8217;s toughest enforcers, Van Turner is ruthless on the ice. He plays hard because it&#8217;s the only way to channel the rage boiling inside, and a reputation as an A-hole is better than everyone knowing the truth. Van has spent his entire life running from a secret that&#8217;s kept him from getting involved in relationships-or accepting lucrative deals with East Coast teams. Then the Carolina Cold Fury makes him an offer he can&#8217;t refuse . . . and Van meets a woman he can&#8217;t resist. Simone Fournier is the stubborn one in her family-and that&#8217;s saying something, considering her brothers are two of the Cold Fury&#8217;s biggest stars. Simone gets what she wants, and what she wants is Van. Still, there&#8217;s a part of him Simone can&#8217;t reach, no matter how hard she tries. In private, he&#8217;s all fire and passion. In public, he freezes her out. Van may want to push her away, but Simone won&#8217;t let him go that easily. Because this time, she&#8217;s playing for keeps. Contains mature themes.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Carolina Cold Fury hockey team is stacked with hotshots. But when a new player joins their ranks, he learns that even superstars can&#8217;t go it alone when it comes to love. Lucas Fournier is only serious about one thing: hockey. The league&#8217;s fun-loving charmer, Luc is always up for a good prank or a great lay, and he has no intention of settling down. But being traded to the Carolina Cold Fury&#8211;and to play alongside his big brother, Max&#8211;is no joke. With another title in sight, the last thing Luc wants is to let his new teammates down. To succeed, Luc will need to keep his head in the game and the most . . . er, demanding member of his anatomy in check. But when temptation hits, Luc hits back harder. Museum curator Stephanie Frazier has always put business before pleasure, which just about explains her nonexistent sex life. But when Stephanie meets Luc at a champagne-fueled gala, she finds herself flirting like crazy&#8211;and going home with the uninhibited athlete. For one night, she learns what passion is all about. She just never counted on the little surprise Luc leaves behind. And that&#8217;s when things really start to get interesting.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hockey star Alexander Crossman has a reputation as a cold-hearted player on and off the ice. Pushed into the sport by his alcoholic father, Alex isn&#8217;t afraid to give fans the proverbial middle finger, relishing his role as the MVP they love to hate. Management, however, isn&#8217;t so amused. Now Alex has a choice: fix his public image through community service or ride the bench. But Alex refuses to be molded into the Carolina Cold Fury poster boy . . . not even by a tempting redhead with killer curves. As a social worker, Sutton Price is accustomed to difficult people like Alex, who&#8217;s been assigned to help her create a drug-abuse awareness program for at-risk youth as part of the Fury&#8217;s effort to clean up his image. What she doesn&#8217;t expect is the arrogant smirk from his perfect lips stirring her most heated fantasies. But Sutton isn&#8217;t one to cross professional boundaries-and besides, Alex doesn&#8217;t do relationships . . . or does he? The more she sees behind Alex&#8217;s bad-boy fa�ade, the more Sutton craves the man she uncovers.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re my wife, and I&#8217;m planning on taking you every day. Understood?&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I understand,&#8221; I tell him, panting in pleasure. &#8220;You can order me to do whatever you like.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Boone     </p>
<p>                    I own the premier hunting and fishing lodge in Alaska. And I need a woman to help run it.     </p>
<p>                    I don&#8217;t want an employee; I need a woman who knows how to take orders in and out of the bedroom.     </p>
<p>                    Delta&#8217;s not what I expected. She wants an adventure, and may not be up for the challenge of running the lodge. But she&#8217;s gonna need to learn if she wants to keep riding my cock.     </p>
<p>                    Delta     </p>
<p>                    I thought it sounded fun. Like a vacation. Not like a real, actual marriage. But that is exactly what this is. I&#8217;m here as Boone&#8217;s mail-order bride and he means business.     </p>
<p>                    I&#8217;d have left already because heaven knows I am a fish out of water here, but he tricked me.     </p>
<p>                    He took me to bed minutes after I arrived, and now I know what I&#8217;d be walking away from if I left.     </p>
<p>                    And while the job is huge, so is his entire package. But can insta-lust turn into insta-love? I guess I&#8217;m going to find out.     </p>
<p>                    WARNING: Don&#8217;t one-click if you&#8217;re offended by a strong mountain man with an off-the-chart sex drive and an irresistible urge to take what is his.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes bad isn&#8217;t good enough&#8230;.     </p>
<p>                    On the outside, Lyle Tarpin is a clean-cut Hollywood actor whose star is on the rise. Inside, he&#8217;s battling his own demons, shunning relationships, and finding solace in the arms of a string of anonymous women paid very well for their discretion. But when he&#8217;s photographed in a compromising position by an over-eager reporter, the only way to save his career is to say that the woman he was with is his fianc&#8217;e. And now Lyle has to play a very public game with the only woman who&#8217;s ever managed to get under his skin.     </p>
<p>                    Struggling waitress Sugar Laine agrees to spend one night with Lyle &#8211; but only because she&#8217;s desperate to save her family home. She never expects that a night of passion will turn into a pretend engagement&#8230;or that the heat between them will blossom into love.     </p>
<p>                    But sometimes love has a price.     </p>
<p>                    And now the only question is &#8211; can Lyle and Sugar afford to pay it?</p>
