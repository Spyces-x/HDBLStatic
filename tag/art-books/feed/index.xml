										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lean UX is synonymous with modern product design and development. By combining human-centric design, agile ways of working, and a strong business sense, designers, product managers, developers, and scrum masters around the world are making Lean UX the leading approach for digital product teams today    </p>
<p>                    In the third edition of this award-winning book, authors Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seiden help you focus on the product experience rather than deliverables. You&#8217;ll learn tactics for integrating user experience design, product discovery, agile methods, and product management. And you&#8217;ll discover how to drive your design in short, iterative cycles to assess what works best for businesses and users. Lean UX guides you through this change&#8211;for the better.    </p>
<p>                    Facilitate the Lean UX process with your team with the Lean UX Canvas<br />
                    Ensure every project starts with clear customer-centric success criteria<br />
                    Understand the role of the designer on an agile team<br />
                    Write and contribute design and experiment stories to the backlog<br />
                    Ensure design work takes place in every sprint<br />
                    Build product discovery into the team&#8217;s &#8220;velocity&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WE DESIGN TO ELICIT RESPONSES from people. We want them to buy something, read more, or take action of some kind. Designing without understanding what makes people act the way they do is like exploring a new city without a map: results will be haphazard, confusing, and inefficient. This book combines real science and research with practical examples to deliver a guide every designer needs. With this book you&#8217;ll design more intuitive and engaging apps, software, websites and products that match the way people think, decide and behave.    </p>
<p>                      INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOUR PRODUCTS.    </p>
<p>                      Apply psychology and behavioral science to your designs.    </p>
<p>                      Here are some of the questions this book will answer:    </p>
<p>                      * What grabs and holds attention.    </p>
<p>                      * What makes memories stick?    </p>
<p>                      * What is more important, peripheral or central vision?    </p>
<p>                      * Can you predict the types of errors people will make?    </p>
<p>                      * What is the limit to someone&#8217;s social circle?    </p>
<p>                      * What line length for text is best?    </p>
<p>                      * Are some fonts better than others?    </p>
<p>                      These are just a few of the questions that the book answers in its deep-dive exploration of what makes people tick.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is crazy. Creative work is hard. And nothing is getting any easier!    </p>
<p>                    In his previous books &#8211; Steal Like an Artistand Show Your Work!, New York Times bestsellers with over a million copies in print combined &#8211; Austin Kleon gave readers the key to unlock their creativity and then showed them how to share it. Now he completes his trilogy with his most inspiring work yet.    </p>
<p>                    Keep Going gives the reader life-changing, illustrated advice and encouragement on how to stay creative, focused, and true to yourself in the face of personal burnout or external distractions. Here is how to Build a Bliss Station &#8211; a place or fixed period where you can disconnect from the world. How to see that Every Day Is Groundhog Day &#8211; yesterday&#8217;s over, tomorrow may never come, so just do what you can do today. How to Forget the Noun, Do the Verb &#8211; stop worrying about being a &#8220;painter&#8221; and just paint.    </p>
<p>                    Keep working. Keep playing. Keep searching. Keep giving. Keep living. Keep Going. It&#8217;s exactly the message all of us need, at exactly the right time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about rivalry among artists. Not the kind of rivalry that grows out of hatred and dislike, but rather, rivalry that emerges from admiration, friendship, love. The kind of rivalry that existed between Degas and Manet, Picasso and Matisse, Pollock and de Kooning, and Freud and Bacon.     </p>
<p>                    These were some of the most famous and creative relationships in the history of art, driving each individual to heights of creativity and inspiration &#8211; and provoking them to despair, jealousy and betrayal. Matisse&#8217;s success threatened Picasso so much that his friends would throw darts at a portrait of his rival&#8217;s beloved daughter Marguerite, shouting &#8216;there&#8217;s one in the eye for Matisse!&#8217; And Willem de Kooning&#8217;s twisted friendship with Jackson Pollock didn&#8217;t stop him taking up with his friend&#8217;s lover barely a year after Pollock&#8217;s fatal car crash.    </p>
<p>                    In The Art of Rivalry, Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic Sebastian Smee explores how, as both artists struggled to come into their own, they each played vital roles in provoking the other&#8217;s creative breakthroughs &#8211; ultimately determining the course of modern art itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost, critically acclaimed historian Toby Lester tells the story of the world&#8217;s most iconic image, the Vitruvian Man, and sheds surprising new light on the artistry and scholarship of Leonardo da Vinci, one of history&#8217;s most fascinating figures.     </p>
<p>                    Deftly weaving together art, architecture, history, theology, and much else, Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost is a first-rate intellectual enchantment.&#8221;&#8211;Charles Mann, author of 1493     </p>
<p>                    Da Vinci didn&#8217;t summon Vitruvian Man out of thin air. He was inspired by the idea originally formulated by the Roman architect Vitruvius, who suggested that the human body could be made to fit inside a circle, long associated with the divine, and a square, related to the earthly and secular. To place a man inside those shapes was to imply that the human body could indeed be a blueprint for the workings of the universe. Da Vinci elevated Vitruvius&#8217; idea to exhilarating heights when he set out to do something unprecedented, if the human body truly reflected the cosmos, he reasoned, then studying its anatomy more thoroughly than had ever been attempted before&#8211;peering deep into body and soul&#8211;might grant him an almost godlike perspective on the makeup of the world.     </p>
<p>                    Written with the same narrative flair and intellectual sweep as Lester&#8217;s award-winning first book, the &#8220;almost unbearably thrilling&#8221; (Simon Winchester) Fourth Part of the World, and beautifully illustrated with Da Vinci&#8217;s drawings, Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost follows Da Vinci on his journey to understanding the secrets of the Vitruvian man. It captures a pivotal time in Western history when the Middle Ages were giving way to the Renaissance, when art, science, and philosophy were rapidly converging, and when it seemed possible that a single human being might embody&#8211;and even understand&#8211;the nature of the universe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>** A RADIO 4 BOOK OF THE WEEK **    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating . . . The history of the world through the eye of a needle . . . I recommend this book to anyone&#8217; THE SPECTATOR<br />
                    &#8216;A charming, absorbing and history that takes us on a journey from the silk roads to sportswear, from ruffs to spacesuits . . . I devoured this quietly feminist book&#8217; SUNDAY TIMES<br />
                    &#8216;Joyful and beautiful&#8217; NATURE<br />
                    &#8216;Will make you rethink your relationship with fabric&#8217; ELLE DECORATION    </p>
<p>                    All textiles begin with a twist. From colourful 30,000-year old threads found on the floor of a Georgian cave to what the linen wrappings of Tutankhamun&#8217;s mummy actually meant; from the Silk Roads to the woollen sails that helped the Vikings reach America 700 years before Columbus; from the lace ruffs that infuriated the puritans to the Indian calicoes and chintzes that powered the Industrial Revolution, our continuing reinvention of cloth tells fascinating stories of human ingenuity.     </p>
<p>                    When we talk of lives hanging by a thread, being interwoven, or part of the social fabric, we are part of a tradition that stretches back many thousands of years. Fabric has allowed us to achieve extraordinary things and survive in unlikely places, and this book shows you how &#8212; and why.    </p>
<p>                    With a cast that includes Chinese empresses, Richard the Lionheart and Bing Crosby, Kassia St Clair takes us on the run with escaped slaves, climbing the slopes of Everest and moonwalking with astronauts. Running like a bright line through history, The Golden Thread offers an unforgettable adventure through our past, present and future.</p>
