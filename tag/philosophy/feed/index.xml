										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famous for his advocacy of &#8216;critical pedagogy&#8217;, Paulo Freire was Latin America&#8217;s foremost educationalist, a thinker and writer whose work and ideas continue to exert enormous influence in education throughout the world today. Education for Critical Consciousness is the main statement of Freire&#8217;s revolutionary method of education. It takes the life situation of the learner as its starting point and the raising of consciousness and the overcoming of obstacles as its goals. For Freire, man&#8217;s striving for his own humanity requires the changing of structures which dehumanize both the oppressor and the oppressed. This edition includes a substantial new introduction by Carlos Alberto Torres, Distinguished Professor and Founding Director of the Paulo Freire Institute, UCLA, USA.    </p>
<p>                    Translated by Myra Bergman Ramos.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distrust That Particular Flavor &#8211; an acclaimed nonfiction collection by William Gibson, bestselling author of Neuromancer</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The future&#8217;s already here: it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed&#8217;</p>
<p>                    William Gibson was writing fiction when he predicted the internet. And as his stories bled into reality so he became one of the first to report on the real-world consequences of cyberspace&#8217;s growth and development.</p>
<p>                    Now, with the dust settling on the first internet revolution, comes Gibson&#8217;s first collection of non-fiction &#8211; essays from the technological and cultural frontiers of this new world. </p>
<p>                    Covering a variety of subjects, they include:</p>
<p>                    &#8211; Metrophagy &#8211; the Art and Science of Digesting Great Cities<br />
                    &#8211; An account of obsession in &#8216;the world&#8217;s attic&#8217; &#8211; eBay<br />
                    &#8211; Reasons why &#8216;The Net is a Waste of Time&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Singapore as &#8216;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; A primer on Japan, our default setting for the future </p>
<p>                    These and many other pieces, collected for the first time in Distrust that Particular Flavour, are studded with revealing autobiographical fragments and map the development of Gibson&#8217;s acute perceptions about modern life. Readers of Neal Stephenson, Ray Bradbury and Iain M. Banks will love this book.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Gibson is a prophet and a satirist, a black comedian and an astounding architect of cool. He&#8217;s also responsible for much of the world we live in&#8217; Spectator</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Part-detective story, part-cultural snapshot &#8230; all bound by Gibson&#8217;s pin-sharp prose&#8217; Arena</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Mornroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death.     </p>
<p>                    Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible&#8211;and reveals to us what it all means.     </p>
<p>                    Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies over the edge, beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the interstate&#8211;the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life&#8211;and of what lies beyond.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King presents an original screenplay and major television event set in Maine&#8217;s remote Little Tall Island. </p>
<p>                    They&#8217;re calling it the Storm of the Century, and it&#8217;s coming hard. The residents of Little Tall Island have seen their share of nasty Maine Nor&#8217;easters, but this one is different. Not only is it packing hurricane-force winds and up to five feet of snow, it&#8217;s bringing something worse. Something even the islanders have never seen before. Something no one wants to see. </p>
<p>                    Just as the first flakes begin to fall, Martha Clarendon, one of Little Tall Island&#8217;s oldest residents, suffers an unspeakably violent death. While her blood dries, Andre Linoge, the man responsible sits calmly in Martha&#8217;s easy chair holding his cane topped with a silver wolf&#8217;s head&#8230;waiting. </p>
<p>                    Linoge knows the townsfolk will come to arrest him. He will let them. For he has come to the island for one reason. And when he meets Constable Mike Anderson, his beautiful wife and child, and the rest of Little Tall&#8217;s tight-knit community, this stranger will make one simple proposition to them all: </p>
<p>                    &#8220;If you give me what I want, I&#8217;ll go away.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BBC R4 Book of the Week<br />
                              &#8216;Brilliant&#8217; Guardian<br />
                              &#8216;Fascinating and often delightful&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                                What if intelligent life on Earth evolved not once, but twice? The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. What can we learn from the encounter?    </p>
<p>                              In Other Minds, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how nature became aware of itself &#8211; a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared.    </p>
<p>                              Tracking the mind&#8217;s fitful development from unruly clumps of seaborne cells to the first evolved nervous systems in ancient relatives of jellyfish, he explores the incredible evolutionary journey of the cephalopods, which began as inconspicuous molluscs who would later abandon their shells to rise above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so &#8211; a journey completely independent from the route that mammals and birds would later take.    </p>
<p>                              But what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually &#8216;think for themselves&#8217;? By tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith casts crucial new light on the octopus mind &#8211; and on our own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a pioneer in the field of mental health comes a groundbreaking book on the healing power of mindsight, the potent skill that allows you to make positive changes in your brain-and in your life.     </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can&#8217;t shake?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you ever wonder why you can&#8217;t stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?<br />
                    &#8211; Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?     </p>
<p>                    What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn&#8217;t mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.     </p>
<p>                    Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal<br />
                    &#8211; a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread<br />
                    &#8211; a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut, and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection<br />
                    &#8211; a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is like watching myself from outside myself and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting her     </p>
<p>                    These and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.</p>

<p>                    In Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek, internationally bestselling author of Start With Why, investigates these great leaders from Marine Corps Officers, who don&#8217;t just sacrifice their place at the table but often their own comfort and even their lives for those in their care, to the heads of big business and government &#8211; each putting aside their own interests to protect their teams.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Brumm&#8217;s Long-Term Thinking for a Short-Sighted World focuses on the problems we face today that share a common, rarely discussed theme: a lack of long-term thinking. The book explores examples-past and present-of humanity pursuing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term well being. Topics include energy, debt, consumerism, agriculture and our skewed perceptions of time.  &#8220;In today&#8217;s world we are grappling at every turn with an increasing energy shortage, food production systems that struggle to feed increasing millions, environmental problems that threaten our survival, a debt crisis that is crippling individuals and governments, and so much more. All of these problems come with their own unique challenges and examined on their own they may seem completely different from each other, but they share one common, rarely discussed hidden thread that runs through the center of each and binds them together: a lack of long-term thinking. We&#8217;re very bad long-term thinkers.&#8221;  Jim delivers a message of hope, helping to answer the question, &#8220;How can I live my life in a way that brings satisfaction, balance, happiness, and a sense of value? In other words, how can I be part of the solution?&#8221; He suggests positive ways to improve our ability to embrace a larger vision of our place in the world.  Conversational, provocative, witty and often laugh-aloud funny, Long-Term Thinking for a Short-Sighted World will inspire readers who are seeking ways to realign priorities and re-examine what brings true, long-term happiness and sustainability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No judgement of taste is innocent &#8211; we are all snobs. Pierre Bourdieu&#8217;s Distinction brilliantly illuminates the social pretentions of the middle classes in the modern world, focusing on the tastes and preferences of the French bourgeoisie. First published in 1979, the book is at once a vast ethnography of contemporary France and a dissection of the bourgeois mind.     </p>
<p>                    In the course of everyday life we constantly choose between what we find aesthetically pleasing, and what we consider tacky, merely trendy, or ugly. Taste is not pure. Bourdieu demonstrates that our different aesthetic choices are all distinctions &#8211; that is, choices made in opposition to those made by other classes. This fascinating work argues that the social world functions simultaneously as a system of power relations and as a symbolic system in which minute distinctions of taste become the basis for social judgement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our brains were designed for tribal life, for getting along with a select group of others (Us), and for fighting off everyone else (Them). But modern life has thrust the world&#8217;s tribes into a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we can find our common ground.    </p>
<p>                    A grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the right kind of reasoning can move us forward.    </p>
<p>                    Joshua Greene is the director of Harvard University&#8217;s Moral Cognition Lab, a pioneering scientist, a philosopher, and an acclaimed teacher. The great challenge of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get along with Them when what they want feels so wrong? Finally, Greene offers a surprisingly simple set of maxims for navigating the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving problems and living better lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are philosophers trying to achieve? How can they succeed? Does philosophy make progress? Is it in competition with science, or doing something completely different, or neither?     </p>
<p>                    Timothy Williamson tackles some of the key questions surrounding philosophy in new and provocative ways, showing how philosophy begins in common sense curiosity, and develops through our capacity to dispute rationally with each other. Discussing philosophy&#8217;s ability to clarify our thoughts, he explains why such clarification depends on the development of philosophical theories, and how those theories can be tested by imaginative thought experiments, and compared against each other by standards<br />
                    similar to those used in the natural and social sciences. He also shows how logical rigour can be understood as a way of enhancing the explanatory power of philosophical theories. Drawing on the history of philosophy to provide a track record of philosophical thinking&#8217;s successes and failures,<br />
                    Williamson overturns widely held dogmas about the distinctive nature of philosophy in comparison to the sciences, demystifies its methods, and considers the future of the discipline.     </p>
<p>                    From thought experiments, to deduction, to theories,  this little book will cause you to totally rethink what philosophy is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important philosophy titles published in the twentieth century, Josef Pieper&#8217;s Leisure, the Basis of Culture is more significant, even more crucial, today than it was when it first appeared more than fifty years ago. This edition also includes his work The Philosophical Act. Leisure is an attitude of the mind and a condition of the soul that fosters a capacity to perceive the reality of the world. Pieper shows that the Greeks and medieval Europeans, understood the great value and importance of leisure. He also points out that religion can be born only in leisure &#8212; a leisure that allows time for the contemplation of the nature of God. Leisure has been, and always will be, the first foundation of any culture. Pieper maintains that our bourgeois world of total labor has vanquished leisure, and issues a startling warning: Unless we regain the art of silence and insight, the ability for non-activity, unless we substitute true leisure for our hectic amusements, we will destroy our culture &#8212; and ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The runaway bestseller with more than four million copies in print! You too can change your life with the priceless wisdom of ten ancient scrolls handed down for thousands of years.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Every sales manager should read The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is a book to keep at the bedside, or on the living room table&#8211;a book to dip into as needed, to browse in now and then, to enjoy in small stimulating portions. It is a book for the hours and for the years, a book to turn to over and over again, as to a friend, a book of moral, spiritual and ethical guidance, an unfailing source of comfort and inspiration.&#8221;&#8211;Lester J. Bradshaw, Jr., Former Dean, Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective Speaking &#038; Human Relations     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I have read almost every book that has ever been written on salesmanship, but I think Og Mandino has captured all of them in The Greatest Salesman in the World. No one who follows these principles will ever fail as a salesman, and no one will ever be truly great without them; but, the author has done more than present the principles&#8211;he has woven them into the fabric of one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read.&#8221;&#8211;Paul J. Meyer, President of Success Motivation Institute, Inc.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I was overwhelmed by The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is, without doubt, the greatest and the most touching story I have ever read. It is so good that there are two musts that I would attach to it: First, you must not lay it down until you have finished it; and secondly, every individual who sells anything, and that includes us all, must read it.&#8221;&#8211;Robert B. Hensley, President, Life Insurance Co. of Kentucky</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An extraordinary book . . . It will shake up your most fundamental beliefs about everyday experience, and it just might change your life.&#8217; Paul Bloom<br />
                    ___    </p>
<p>                    For the millions of people who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris&#8217;s new book is a guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.    </p>
<p>                     Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experience of contemplatives such as Jesus, Buddha and other saints and sages of history-and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.    </p>
<p>                    Waking Up is part seeker&#8217;s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris-a scientist, philosopher, and famous sceptic-could write it.<br />
                     ___    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades, we have looked to management theorists, organizational psychologists and economists to tell us how we can squeeze the most out of people at work. The result? People are uninspired, feel like cogs in a machine and prefer to leave traditional work structures behind. Numbers and productivity can only get you so far.    </p>
<p>                    What Philosophy Can Teach You About Being a Better Leader offers a different route that will allow you to reconnect with the humanist values of work. By turning to philosophy, and what it teaches us about finding fulfilment and living a good life, this book uncovers the ways you can re-engage your workforce by valuing its members as people, rather than just tools within the process.    </p>
<p>                    The four authors argue that the rise of the &#8216;omnipotent leader&#8217;, who focuses on telling rather than leading, risks creating a new generation of feudal CEOs and needs to be resisted. With the help of Aristotle, Socrates, Kant and Nietzsche, as well as a whole host of other brilliant minds, they turn traditional management practices on their head, showing how moving away from traditional, hierarchical, risk focused control structures can lead to improved employee engagement, increased productivity and better outcomes for the entire business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From &#8216;one of the most influential thinkers of our time&#8217; (Sunday Times): how to respond to today&#8217;s demands on our attention    </p>
<p>                    In this brilliant follow-up to The Case for Working with Your Hands, Matthew Crawford investigates the challenge of mastering one&#8217;s own mind. With ever-increasing demands on our attention, and with capitalism increasingly invading every space, how do we focus on what&#8217;s really important in our lives?    </p>
<p>                    Exploring the intense focus of ice-hockey players, the flow of a cook in their element, and the inherited craft of building pipe organs, Crawford argues that in order to flourish, we need to return to lives where we establish meaningful connections with objects and the people around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of the New York Times-bestselling Four Thousand Weeks, a totally original approach to self-help: success through failure, calm through embracing anxiety     </p>
<p>                    Self-help books don&#8217;t seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealth&#8211;even if you can get it&#8211;doesn&#8217;t necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can&#8217;t even agree on what happiness means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way?<br />
                     Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it&#8217;s our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertainty&#8211;the very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, The Antidote is the intelligent person&#8217;s guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A leading German metaphysician of the 19th century, Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860) exerted an influence far beyond the hermetic world of philosophy, with adherents ranging from Richard Wagner and Friedrich Nietzsche to Leo Tolstoy and Thomas Mann. Among Schopenhauer&#8217;s chief contributions to the field of philosophy are his rejection of the idealism of his contemporaries and his embrace of a practical variety of materialism. He jettisons the traditional philosophic jargon for a brisk, compelling style that employs direct terms to express the metaphysics of the will.<br />
                    In The Wisdom of Life, an essay from Schopenhauer&#8217;s final work, Parerga und Paralipomena (1851), the philosopher favors individual strength of will and independent, reasoned deliberation over the tendency to act on irrational impulses. He examines the ways in which life can be arranged to derive the highest degree of pleasure and success, presents guidelines to achieving this full and rich manner of living, and advises that even a life well lived must always aspire to grander heights. Abounding in subjects of enduring relevance, Schopenhauer&#8217;s highly readable work appears here in an excellent translation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The national bestseller, now available in a non-illustrated, standard format paperback edition    </p>
<p>                    The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work. A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people&#8211;including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the &#8220;song of the universe, the music of the spheres.&#8221; With Bill Moyers, one of America&#8217;s most prominent journalists, as his thoughtful and engaging interviewer, The Power of Myth touches on subjects from modern marriage to virgin births, from Jesus to John Lennon, offering a brilliant combination of intelligence and wit.     </p>
<p>                    This extraordinary book reveals how the themes and symbols of ancient narratives continue to bring meaning to birth, death, love, and war. From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell&#8217;s work, The Power of Myth continues to exert a profound influence on our culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billions of dollars were hastily poured into the global banking system in a frantic attempt at financial stabilisation. So why has it not been possible to bring the same forces to bear in addressing world poverty and environmental crisis? In this take-no-prisoners analysis, Slavoj Zizek frames the moral failures of the modern world in terms of the epoch-making events of the first decade of this century. What he finds is the old one-two punch of history: the jab of tragedy, the right hook of farce. In the attacks of 9/11 and the global credit crunch, liberalism dies twice: as a political doctrine and as an economic theory. The election of Donald Trump only confirms the bankruptcy of a liberal order on its last legs. First as Tragedy, Then as Farce is a call for the left to reinvent itself in the light of our desperate historical situation. The time for liberal, moralistic blackmail is over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DEBUTED AT NO.1 ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST<br />
                    NO.1 BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE SOCIAL ANIMAL    </p>
<p>                    Are you on your first or second mountain?<br />
                    Is life about you &#8211; or others?<br />
                    About success &#8211; or something deeper?     </p>
<p>                    The  world tells us that we should pursue our self-interest: career wins,  high status, nice things. These are the goals of our first mountain. But  at some point in our lives we might find that we&#8217;re not interested in  what other people tell us to want. We want the things that are truly  worth wanting.    </p>
<p>                    This is the second mountain.     </p>
<p>                    What does it  mean to look beyond yourself and find a moral cause? To forget about  independence and discover dependence &#8211; to be utterly enmeshed in a web  of warm relationships? What does it mean to value intimacy, devotion,  responsibility and commitment above individual freedom? In The Second Mountain  David Brooks explores the meaning and possibilities that scaling a  second mountain offer us and the four commitments that most commonly  move us there: family, vocation, philosophy and community. Inspiring,  personal and full of joy, this book will help you discover why you were  really put on this earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert B. Reich makes a powerful case for the expansion of America&#8217;s moral imagination. Rooting his argument in common sense and everyday reality, he demonstrates that a common good constitutes the very essence of any society or nation. Societies, he says, undergo virtuous cycles that reinforce the common good as well as vicious cycles that undermine it, one of which America has been experiencing for the past five decades. This process can and must be reversed. But first we need to weigh the moral obligations of citizenship and carefully consider how we relate to honor, shame, patriotism, truth, and the meaning of leadership.     </p>
<p>                     Powerful, urgent, and utterly vital, this is a heartfelt missive from one of our foremost political thinkers.</p>

<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our fast-paced society does not approve of solitude; being alone is literally anti-social and some even find it sinister. Why is this so when autonomy, personal freedom and individualism are more highly prized than ever before? Sara Maitland answers this question by exploring changing attitudes throughout history. Offering experiments and strategies for overturning our fear of solitude, she helps us to practise it without anxiety and encourages us to see the benefits of spending time by ourselves. By indulging in the experience of being alone, we can be inspired to find our own rewards and ultimately lead more enriched, fuller lives.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.&#8217; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    Everyone says they want to be happy. But that&#8217;s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness &#8211; from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#8217;s suggested routes to happiness and success &#8211; such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals &#8211; can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety.    </p>
<p>                    Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that &#8216;everything&#8217;s fine&#8217; even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Immensely positive and life-affirming&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;This is the blue print to a good life&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Have Or to Be? is one of the seminal books of the second half of the 20th century. Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With half a million copies in print, How to Read a Book is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader, completely rewritten and updated with new material.<br />
                         Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them-from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to &#8220;judge a book by its cover,&#8221; and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author&#8217;s message from the text.<br />
                         Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works.<br />
                         Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you still the person who lived fifteen, ten or five years ago? Fifteen, ten or five minutes ago? Can you plan for your retirement if the you of thirty years hence is in some sense a different person? What and who is the real you? Does it remain constant over time and place, or is it something much more fragmented and fluid? Is it known to you, or are you as much a mystery to yourself as others are to you?With his usual wit, infectious curiosity and bracing scepticism, Julian Baggini sets out to answer these fundamental and unsettling questions. His fascinating quest draws on the history of philosophy, but also anthropology, sociology, psychology and neurology; he talks to theologians, priests, allegedly reincarnated Lamas, and delves into real-life cases of lost memory, personality disorders and personal transformation; and, candidly and engagingly, he describes his own experiences. After reading The Ego Trick, you will never see yourself in the same way again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happiness has meant different things in different times: according to Aristotle, only the gods could be truly happy, but if you lived ethically, you might come close; for medieval Christians, the best way to be happy was to suffer pain and for Romantic philosophers like Rousseau, society made happiness impossible. But what does it mean to be happy today? In this devastatingly witty new book, Carl Cederstrom traces our present-day fantasy of happiness from its roots in the 60&#8217;s counter-culture. He argues that happiness is now defined by a desire to be &#8216;authentic&#8217;, to experience physical pleasure, and to cultivate one&#8217;s &#8216;brand&#8217; as an employee. Along the way we encounter the renegade Austrian psychoanalysts, Big Pharma, Californian bohemians, self-help gurus and Silicon Valley CEOs who have all contributed to our current fantasy. Whilst these ideals may have depicted the good life in the 70s, a time of affluence and abundance, they are no longer sustainable in our current age of austerity. It is high time, Cederstrom argues, that we construct new fantasies of happiness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is philosophy that has the duty of protecting us &#8230; without it no one can lead a life free of fear or worry&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    For several years of his turbulent life, in which he was dogged by ill health, exile and danger, Seneca was the guiding hand of the Roman Empire. This selection of Seneca&#8217;s letters shows him upholding the ideals of Stoicism &#8211; the wisdom of the self-possessed person immune to life&#8217;s setbacks &#8211; while valuing friendship and courage, and criticizing the harsh treatment of slaves and the cruelties in the gladiatorial arena. The humanity and wit revealed in Seneca&#8217;s interpretation of Stoicism is a moving and inspiring declaration of the dignity of the individual mind.    </p>

<p>                    We&#8217;ve worked hard to make the thinkers in this book clear, relevant and charming, mining the history of knowledge to bring you the ideas we think have the greatest importance to our times.    </p>
<p>                    This 480-page book contains the canon of The School of Life, the gallery of individuals across the millennia who help to frame our intellectual project &#8211; and we have succeeded if, in the days and years ahead, you find yourself turning to our thinkers to illuminate the multiple dilemmas, joys and griefs of daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There are at least two kinds of games,&#8221; states James P. Carse as he begins this extraordinary book. &#8220;One could be called finite; the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    Finite games are the familiar contests of everyday life; they are played in order to be won, which is when they end. But infinite games are more mysterious. Their object is not winning, but ensuring the continuation of play. The rules may change, the boundaries may change, even the participants may change-as long as the game is never allowed to come to an end.    </p>
<p>                     What are infinite games? How do they affect the ways we play our finite games? What are we doing when we play-finitely or infinitely? And how can infinite games affect the ways in which we live our lives?    </p>
<p>                     Carse explores these questions with stunning elegance, teasing out of his distinctions a universe of observation and insight, noting where and why and how we play, finitely and infinitely. He surveys our world-from the finite games of the playing field and playing board to the infinite games found in culture and religion-leaving all we think we know illuminated and transformed. Along the way, Carse finds new ways of understanding everything, from how an actress portrays a role to how we engage in sex, from the nature of evil to the nature of science. Finite games, he shows, may offer wealth and status, power and glory, but infinite games offer something far more subtle and far grander.    </p>
<p>                     Carse has written a book rich in insight and aphorism. Already an international literary event, Finite and Infinite Games is certain to be argued about and celebrated for years to come. Reading it is the first step in learning to play the infinite game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Honest, funny and dripping with witty aphorisms. Extremely entertaining and enlightening [&#8230;] all the way to journey&#8217;s end&#8217; Herald     </p>
<p>                    One of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy, Religion for Atheists and The School of Life, presents a travel guide with a difference &#8211; an exploration of why we travel, and what we learn along the way&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Few activities seem to promise as much happiness as going travelling: taking off for somewhere else, somewhere far from home, a place with more interesting weather, customs and landscapes. But although we are inundated with advice on where to travel to, we seldom ask why we go and how we might become more fulfilled by doing so.    </p>
<p>                    With the help of a selection of writers, artists and thinkers &#8211; including Flaubert, Edward Hopper, Wordsworth and Van Gogh &#8211; Alain de Botton provides invaluable insights into everything from holiday romance to hotel minibars, airports to sightseeing. The perfect antidote to those guides that tell us what to do when we get there, The Art of Travel tries to explain why we really went in the first place &#8211; and helpfully suggest how we might be happier on our journeys.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Delightful, profound, entertaining. I doubt if de Botton has written a dull sentence in his life&#8217; Jan Morris    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An elegant and subtle work, unlike any other. Beguiling&#8217; Colin Thubron, The Times</p>
