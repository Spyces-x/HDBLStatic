<p>                    New York Times #1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    The highly anticipated second novel from Angie Thomas returns to the world of Garden Heights for a powerful story about hip hop, freedom of speech &#8211; and fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you.    </p>
<p>                    Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. As the daughter of an underground hip hop legend who died right before he hit big, Bri&#8217;s got massive shoes to fill. But when her first song goes viral for all the wrong reasons, Bri finds herself at the centre of controversy and portrayed by the media as more menace than MC. And with an eviction notice staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it &#8211; she has to. Even if it means becoming the very thing the public has made her out to be.    </p>

<p>                    Greg Heffley has always been in a hurry to grow up. Being older means you can live alone, eat whatever you want for dinner and don&#8217;t have to share with your brothers. PERFECT.</p>
<p>                    At least, that&#8217;s what Greg thought, but it turns out there&#8217;s a lot more to growing up like dealing with boy/girl dances, increased responsibilities and awkward changes.</p>
<p>                    On top of all this, he&#8217;s fighting with this best friend Rowley, and is being dragged to his uncle&#8217;s FIFTH wedding. Surely there&#8217;s more to growing up than THIS?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Miserable Mill the siblings encounter a giant pincher machine, a bad casserole, a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be, a hypnotist, a terrible accident and coupons.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Reptile Room the siblings endure a car accident, a terrible smell, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a brass reading lamp, and the re-appearance of a person they&#8217;d hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1956 Sarah Dewhurst&#8217;s father shocks her by hiring a dragon to work the farm. The dragon is a smaller blue rather than the traditional larger reds, though even the reds are now scarce. When the blue dragon, Kazimir, unexpectedly saves Sarah and her friend Jason Inagawa from the attentions of the racist police deputy, Kelby, everything changes. Sarah is part of a prophecy and she must escape the clutches of Malcolm, an assassin from a Believer Cell, the dragon-worshiping cult. When Sarah, Malcolm and Kazimir eventually converge, they are thrown into another universe, where dragons seem never to have existed. Can they save this world and the one they left?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing to be found in the pages of A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair.</p>
<p>                              You still have time to choose another international best-seller to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on &#8230;</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

<p>                              And what about All The Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>

<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>***Perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz&#8217;s Alex Rider series***</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Not since Nancy Drew has a nosy, crime-obsessed kid been so hard to resist&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                     Woody Lambert is in trouble. He comes from a broken family, suffers bad grades at school and his older brother, Tony, is on probation for a drug offence. When Woody inadvertently gets caught up with Tony and one of his friends, Garth, cruising around Strattenburg in a beaten-up Mustang drinking beer, one thing leads to another and Garth holds up a convenience store with a fake gun. </p>
<p>                     Though he had no involvement in the crime other than being in Garth&#8217;s car, Woody is arrested as an accomplice. He&#8217;s going to need serious legal advice to avoid juvenile prison.</p>
<p>                     Enter Theodore Boone: after all, Theo has already decided that he will become the best courtroom lawyer in the state. It&#8217;s just that, at the age of thirteen, Theo is years from being a qualified lawyer &#8211; and Woody needs help right now . . . </p>
<p>                     ***********************</p>
<p>                     Further praise for the Theodore Boone series</p>
<p>                     &#8216;If you aspire to turn your children into lawyers who will keep you in your old age, John Grisham&#8217;s Theodore Boone, his first novel for young people, might be for you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                     &#8216;For any young readers tired of wizards, vampires and Greek gods, there&#8217;s now a new kid on the young fiction block, and this one really does have serious powers: Theodore Boone, half-boy, half-lawyer&#8230; fans will be pleased to know there will be more of Theo&#8217;s adventures to come&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Nobody does legal fiction better&#8217; &#8211; Daily Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Gripping . . . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. I think everyone will be enthralled by Theodore Boone&#8217; &#8211; Scholastic News</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series &#8211; set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>                    Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in  their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother,  Gaea. Her giants have risen &#8211; all of them &#8211; and they&#8217;re stronger than ever. </p>
<p>                    They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods  sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus &#8211; in order to  wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp  Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost  within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to  Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs  back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps.  The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.</p>
<p>                    The gods, still  suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of  young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea&#8217;s army of powerful giants? As  dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have  sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over&#8230;</p>
<p>                            Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A cracking read&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Express</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Slippery Slope the siblings face a secret message, a toboggan, a deceitful trap, a swarm of snow gnats and a scheming villain&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Ersatz Elevatorthe siblings face a darkened staircase, a red herring, friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway and parsley soda.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All The Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t miss Enola Holmes: The Case of the Missing Marquess! Now a Netflix original movie starring Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill, and Helena Bonham Carter!</p>
<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8217;s landlady, Mrs. Tupper, is the closest thing Enola has to family these days, besides her occasional run-ins with her brother Sherlock. Even though Mrs. Tupper is nearly deaf and can barely cook, she&#8217;s an endearing presence as Enola longs for her absent mother. So imagine her horror when Enola comes home to find Mrs. Tupper kidnapped! Who would take her, and why? And what does Florence Nightingale have to do with it? From the master of mystery Nancy Springer, here&#8217;s another absorbing adventure for our award-winning, unstoppable heroine, Enola Holmes. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Don&#8217;t miss the second series of His Dark Materials on BBC One this November.**</p>
<p>                    From the author of the phenomenal His Dark Materials comes the next chapter in the story of Lyra Silvertongue . . .</p>
<p>                     Lyra is now studying at St Sophia&#8217;s College, Oxford, with her daemon Pantalaimon. </p>
<p>                     But, for the first time there are serious divisions between the two.<br />
                    Lyra is questioning everything she once held dear. Pan misses the impulsiveness of their youth. </p>
<p>                     When an act of terrible violence breaks the peace of the Oxford night, Lyra and Pan&#8217;s relationship reaches a crisis and they are drawn, far from home, into the dangerous factions of a world they had no idea existed.</p>
<p>                     The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself and to grow up and make sense of the world around you. </p>
<p>                    This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.</p>
<p>                    *Exclusive to the paperback edition, Chris Wormell&#8217;s new original illustrations bring Lyra&#8217;s world vividly to life.*<br />
                     _____</p>
<p>                     Reviews for The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two:</p>
<p>                     &#8220;[Pullman] has created a fantasy world, made yet more satisfying in rigour and stylistic elegance. This is a book for getting older with&#8221; Guardian, Book of the Week</p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Secret Commonwealth is ablaze with light and life. The writing is exquisite; every sentence sings &#8230; To read Pullman is to experience the world refreshed, aglow, in Technicolour&#8221; i</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman&#8217;s story is still thought-provoking &#8230; This book elegantly weaves in live issues, from Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis to facts in the post-truth era. And Pullman&#8217;s prose is rewarding as ever&#8221; The Times</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A long, taxing, complex journey, laced with beauty, terror and philosophy&#8221; Metro</p>
<p>                     &#8220;As ever, Pullman&#8217;s story is complex and vast but home to some of the finest storytelling in the 21st century. Revel in whole new worlds and enjoy one of literature&#8217;s most wonderful heroines before she comes to HBO and the BBC&#8221; Stylist</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman is confronting readers with the horrors of our own world reflected back at us. In The Secret Commonwealthhe creates a fearful symmetry&#8221; The Herald</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>

But that girl, Lady Cecily, has disappeared without a trace. Braving the midnight streets, Enola must unravel the clues to find this left-handed lady, but in order to save her, Enola risks revealing more than she should. Will she be able to keep her identity a secret and find Lady Cecily, or will the one thing she is trying to save&#8211;her freedom&#8211;be lost forever?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    I look like a normal kid. Only there&#8217;s a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me. </p>
<p>                    Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball. </p>
<p>                    This time, we&#8217;re under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we&#8217;ll be invaded by monsters. Big ones. </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />

<p>                    The battle for Camp Jupiter is over. New Rome is safe. Tarquin and his army of the undead have been defeated. Somehow Apollo has made it out alive, with a little bit of help from the Hunters of Artemis.    </p>

<p>                    Now Apollo and Meg must get ready for the final &#8211; and, let&#8217;s face it, probably fatal &#8211; adventure. They must face the last emperor, the terrifying Nero, and destroy him once and for all.    </p>
<p>                    Can Apollo find his godly form again? Will Meg be able to face up to her troubled past? Destiny awaits . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An irreverent and irresistible New York Times bestselling romance between the so-called Designated Ugly Fat Friend and the Hot Jock.      </p>
<p>                    Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper may not be the prettiest girl in her high school, but she has a loyal group of friends, a biting wit, and a spot-on BS detector. She&#8217;s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush, who calls Bianca the Duff&#8211;the Designated Ugly Fat Friend&#8211;of her crew.     </p>
<p>                    But things aren&#8217;t so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him.     </p>
<p>                    Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn&#8217;t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she&#8217;s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?&#8217; said Ron incredulously. &#8216;You&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8217; (From Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)  Published by the charity Lumos in association with Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is the first new book from J. K. Rowling since the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The Tales of Beedle the Bard played a crucial role in assisting Harry, with his friends Ron and Hermione, to finally defeat Lord Voldemort. Fans will be thrilled to have this opportunity to read the tales in full. An exciting addition to the canon of Harry Potter, the tales reveal the wonderful versatility of the author, as she tackles with relish the structure and varying tones of a classic fairy tale. There are five tales: &#8216;The Tale of the Three Brothers&#8217;, recounted in Deathly Hallows, plus &#8216;The Fountain of Fair Fortune&#8217;, &#8216;The Warlock&#8217;s Hairy Heart&#8217;, &#8216;The Wizard and the Hopping Pot&#8217;, and &#8216;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump&#8217;. Each has its own magical character and will bring delight, laughter and the thrill of mortal peril.<br />
                    Translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger, the tales are introduced and illustrated by J. K. Rowling. Also included are notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore, which appear by kind permission of the Hogwarts Headmasters&#8217; Archive.  Lumos is a charity founded by J. K. Rowling which aims to make life better for disadvantaged children. Registered Charity Number: 1112575.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gorgeously written and oh-so-deeply felt &#8211; Nicola Yoon, author of Everything Everything and The Sun is Also a Star    </p>
<p>                    From the author of the New York Times bestseller All the Bright Places comes a heart-wrenching story about what it means to see (and love) someone for who they truly are.    </p>
<p>                     Everyone thinks they know Libby Strout.<br />
                    I know the part I want to play here at MVB High. I want to be the girl who can do anything.    </p>
<p>                    Once dubed &#8216;America&#8217;s Fattest Teen&#8217;, she is only seen for her weight. Not the girl underneath.    </p>
<p>                    Since her mum&#8217;s death she&#8217;s been picking up the pieces in private, alone with her heartbroken father.    </p>
<p>                    But now, Libby is ready. She&#8217;s ready for high school, for new friends, for love and for every possibility life has to offer.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone thinks they know Jack Masselin too.<br />
                    Be charming. Be hilarious. Don&#8217;t get too close to anyone.    </p>
<p>                    Yes, he&#8217;s got swagger, but he&#8217;s also mastered the art of fitting in.    </p>
<p>                    What no one knows is that Jack has a secret: he can&#8217;t recognize faces. Even his own brothers are strangers to him.    </p>
<p>                    He&#8217;s the guy who can re-engineer and rebuild anything, but he can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on with the inner workings of his own brain.     </p>
<p>                     When Jack and Libby meet, they discover that the more time they spend together, the less alone they feel.</p>

<p>                    There&#8217;s only one way he can earn back Zeus&#8217; favour, and that&#8217;s to seek and restore the ancient oracles &#8211; but that&#8217;s easier said than done. </p>
<p>                    Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave may hold answers. </p>

<p>                    Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame.</p>
<p>                    To stay alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood. </p>
<p>                    Will he survive the greatest challenge of his four thousand year existence?<br />

<p>                    The Darkling is more determined than ever to claim Alina&#8217;s  magic and use it to take the Ravkan throne. With nowhere else to turn,  Alina enlists the help of an infamous privateer and sets out to lead the  Grisha army.</p>
<p>                    But as the truth of Alina&#8217;s destiny unfolds, she  slips deeper into the Darkling&#8217;s deadly game of forbidden magic, and  further away from her humanity. To save her country, Alina will have to  choose between her power and the love she thought would always be her  shelter. No victory can come without sacrifice &#8211; and only she can face  the oncoming storm.</p>

Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling&#8217;s timeless classic, Jim Kay&#8217;s glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.     </p>
<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

<p>                    Meanwhile, Hazel and the crew of the Argo II have a choice: to stop a war or save their friends. Whichever road they take one thing is certain &#8211; in the Underworld, evil is inescapable.</p>

<p>A dance at Greg&#8217;s middle school has everyone scrambling to find a partner, and Greg is determined not to be left by the wayside. So he concocts a desperate plan to find someone anyone! to go with on the big night.</p>
<p>But Greg&#8217;s schemes go hilariously awry, and his only option is to attend the dance with his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and a female classmate as a &#8220;group of friends.&#8221; But the night is long, and anything can happen along the way. Who will arrive at the dance triumphantly, and who will end up being the third wheel?</p>
