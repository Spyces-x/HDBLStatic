<p>                    Expect the unexpected in this veritable treasure trove of enthralling, witty, dark tales that could only come from the imagination of the greatest storyteller of our time.    </p>
<p>                    In this eerie, enchanting compilation, Stephen King takes readers down a road less travelled (for good reason) in the blockbuster e-book &#8216;Riding the Bullet&#8217;. Terror becomes deja vu all over again when you get &#8216;That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French&#8217;. &#8216;LT&#8217;s Theory of Pets&#8217; will make you stop and think before giving a dog to a loved one. And there are eleven more stories that will keep you awake until dawn.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Stephen King Amusement Park &#8211; an unnerving experience, with rides every which way to hell . . . and a few to glory.    </p>
<p>                    A solitary finger pokes out of a drain. Novelty teeth turn predatory. The Nevada desert swallows a Cadillac. Meanwhile, the legend of Castle Rock returns . . . and grows on you. What does it all mean? What else could it mean? Stephen King is here with a powerful collection of stories &#8211; a vast, many-chambered cave of a volume.    </p>
<p>                    The long reach of Stephen King&#8217;s imagination will take you on a roller coaster to places you&#8217;ve never been before. You will lose sleep. But Stephen King, writing to beat the devil, will do your dreaming for you.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to fully know anyone? Even those we love the most? What tips someone over the edge to commit a crime?</p>
<p>                    For a Nebraska farmer, the turning point comes when his wife threatens to sell off the family homestead.</p>
<p>                    A cozy mystery writer plots a savage revenge after a brutal encounter with a stranger.</p>
<p>                    Dave Streeter gets the chance to cure himself from illness &#8211; if he agrees to impose misery on an old rival.</p>
<p>                    And Darcy Anderson discovers a box containing her husband&#8217;s dark and terrifying secrets &#8211; he&#8217;s not the man who keeps his nails short and collects coins.  And now he&#8217;s heading home . . .</p>
<p>                    Like DIFFERENT SEASONS and FOUR PAST MIDNIGHT, which generated such enduring hit films as The Shawshank Redemption and Stand by Me, FULL DARK, NO STARS proves Stephen King a master of the long story form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FIRST TIME ON AUDIO&#8230;<br />
                    An Unabridged Novella Unavailable In Any Collection! </p>
<p>                    Tapping into our primal fears of modern technology that made Cell a #1 bestseller, Stephen King sets his sights on the latest high-tech gadget in UR,  in which a mysterious e-book reader opens a disturbing window into other worlds. </p>
<p>                    Reeling from a painful break-up, English instructor and avid book lover Wesley Smith is haunted by his ex-girlfriend&#8217;s parting shot: Why can&#8217;t you just read off the computer like everyone else? He buys an e-book reader out of spite, but soon finds he can use the device to glimpse realities he had never before imagined, discovering literary riches beyond his wildest dreams&#8230;and all-too-human tragedies that surpass his most terrible nightmares. </p>
<p>                    From vintage cars (Christine and From a Buick 8) to household appliances (Maximum Overdrive) to exercise equipment (Stationary Bike), Stephen King has mesmerized us with tales of apparently ordinary machines that take on lives of their own. UR gives this classic theme an up-to-the-minute spin, resulting in a horror masterpiece for our time and for the ages.</p>

<p>                    The No.1 bestselling author delivers an &#8216;outstanding&#8217; (USA Today) collection of thrilling stories, introducing each one with a fascinating piece on when, where or how he came to write it.</p>
<p>                    There is a treasure here for every reader: a man who keeps reliving exactly the same life, repeating his mistakes over and over again; a columnist who kills people by writing their obituaries; a poignant tale about the end of the human race and a firework competition between neighbours which reaches an explosive climax. And, exclusive to this paperback edition (and the eBook from 6 September), a brand new story &#8216;Cookie Jar&#8217;.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I made them especially for you,&#8217; says King. &#8216;Feel free to examine them, but please be careful. The best of them have teeth.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Famine, Death, War, and Pestilence&#8211;the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the harbingers of Armageddon&#8211;these are our guides through the Wastelands.From the Book of Revelation to The Road Warrior, from A Canticle for Leibowitz to The Road, storytellers have long imagined the end of the world, weaving eschatological tales of catastrophe, chaos, and calamity. In doing so, these visionary authors have addressed one of the most challenging and enduring themes of imaginative fiction: the nature of life in the aftermath of total societal collapse.Gathering together the best postapocalyptic literature of the last two decades from many of today&#8217;s most renowned authors of speculative fiction&#8211;including George R. R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Orson Scott Card, Carol Emshwiller, Jonathan Lethem, Octavia E. Butler, and Stephen King&#8211;Wastelands explores the scientific, psychological, and philosophical questions of what it means to remain human in the wake of Armageddon. Whether the end of the world comes through nuclear war, ecological disaster, or cosmological cataclysm, these are tales of survivors, in some cases struggling to rebuild the society that was, in others, merely surviving, scrounging for food in depopulated ruins and defending themselves against monsters, mutants, and marauders.Wastelands delves into this bleak landscape, uncovering the raw human emotion and heart-pounding thrills at the genre&#8217;s core.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Penguin Classic </p>
<p>                    In Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck&#8217;s beautifully rendered depictions of small yet fateful moments that transform ordinary lives, these twelve early stories introduce both the subject and style of artistic expression that recur in the most important works of his career. Each of these self-contained stories is linked to the others by the presence of the Munroes, a family whose misguided behavior and lack of sensitivity precipitate disasters and tragedies. As the individual dramas unfold, Steinbeck reveals the self-deceptions, intellectual limitations, and emotional vulnerabilities that shape the characters&#8217; reactions and gradually erode the harmony and dreams that once formed the foundation of the community. This edition includes an introduction and notes by James Nagel. </p>
<p>                    For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was not long after Halloween when Stephen King received a telephone call from his editor. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you do a book about the entire horror phenomenon as you see it? Books, movies, radio, TV, the whole thing.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The result is this unique combination of fantasy and autobiography, of classic horror writing honed to an unforgettable edge by the bestselling master of the genre.    </p>
<p>                    DANSE MACABRE ranges across the whole spectrum of horror in popular culture from the seminal classics of Dracula and Frankenstein. It is a charming and fascinating book, replete with pertinent anecdote and observation, in which Stephen King describes his ideas on how horror works on many levels and how he brings it to bear on his own inimitable novels.    </p>
<p>                    There is a reason why Stephen King is one of the bestselling writers in the world, ever. Described in the Guardian as an author who &#8216;knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers&#8217;, Stephen King writes books that draw you in and are impossible to put down.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adapted as a major TV series, produced by Steven Spielberg, King&#8217;s bestselling novel centres on a small town suddenly and inexplicably sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible dome.    </p>
<p>                    In UNDER THE DOME, King has produced another riveting masterpiece. The end of every chapter hooks you into the next, drawing you inside a psychological drama that is so rich, you don&#8217;t read it, you live it.    </p>
<p>                    It is the story of the small town of Chester&#8217;s Mill, Maine which is inexplicably and suddenly sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible force field. No one can get in and no one can get out.    </p>
<p>                    The normal rules of society are suddenly changed and when food, electricity and water run short, the community begins to crumble. As a new and more sinister social order develops, Dale Barbara, Iraq veteran, teams up with a handful of intrepid citizens to fight against the corruption that is sweeping through the town and to try to discover the source of the Dome before it is too late . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life is so unfair, and it sends many things to try Professor Dr Moritz-Maria von Igelfeld, author of Portuguese Irregular Verbs and pillar of the Institute of Romance Philology in the proud Bavarian city of Regensburg.  There is the undeserved rise of his rival (and owner of a one-legged dachshund), Detlev Amadeus Unterholzer; the interminable ramblings of the librarian, Herr Huber; and the condescension of his colleagues with regard to his unmarried state. But when his friend Ophelia Prinzel takes it upon herself to match-make, and duly produces a cheerful heiress with her own Schloss, it appears that the professor&#8217;s true worth is about to be recognised.  Maddening, idiotic and hugely entertaining, von Igelfeld is an inspired comic creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This quick-read story is a fictional account that draws from experiences of the author as inspiration, set in real-time Portland, Oregon, in the age of COVID. &#8220;MOMMY&#8221; is about candid conversations involving bullying and the desire of a school-age child to continue virtual learning vs in-school learning. Its aim is to prod the reader to think, emote, and act if necessary. If you or someone you care for has gone thru bullying episodes, I hope this story helps with your own journey. There is no single path to take. I encourage you to be there for them (for yourself). Are you ready for that? Bullying over this past decade has started to see the light of day. For the longest time, it has been an unspoken reality of many growing up in educational systems, whether public or private, as an example. There are a lot of resources available today that didn&#8217;t exist before. Seek them out.Being different has often been seen as an opportunity for those looking for attention or a reaction to inflict pain and duress on the one perceived different. Often times this has led to a cycle of abuse that lasts a lifetime, for both the tormentor and recipient.Many specific events will be embedded in your mind FOREVER. Some details may get blurry, but the emotional pain stays ever present and raw, ready to be fired up in an instant.Bullies give you power in time, but it feels like they strip your soul as it happens. For many recipients, they withdraw and retreat, create a protective bubble so to speak, but hopefully in time, they open up and start the healing process. Baggage stays packed until you choose to unpack it. Candid conversations in every day settings can be the kickstart to the healing and unpacking process. If unpacking that baggage is self care, and self care is sexy, then survivors of bullying are going be some of the sexiest people alive. Help stop the cycle of abuse.</p>
