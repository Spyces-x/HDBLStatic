<p>                    Partnering with subject matter experts can really pay off. SMEs (we pronounce it smees) bring credibility and relevance to live training. They enrich learning programs with their insight and depth of experience. But content expertise alone isn&#8217;t enough to deliver effective training. . . .    </p>
<p>                    SMEs want to do well in the classroom, but it&#8217;s often unfamiliar terrain. They&#8217;re authorities on content, not talent development. Without guidance, they may overshare or find themselves unable to facilitate a productive discussion&#8212;all of which frustrate learners. But, with the right approach, you can bring SMEs into the training room successfully, in a way that makes learners, instructors, and managers feel like their goals are being met.     </p>
<p>                    Effective SMEs: A Trainer&#8217;s Guide for Helping Subject Matter Experts Facilitate Learning is the blueprint to managing SME-led training. Authors Dale Ludwig and Greg Owen-Boger offer first-rate advice gleaned from decades helping presenters, instructional designers, and SMEs become better communicators. Underlying all their tips is their belief that SMEs and instructional designers must get comfortable with each other&#8217;s role. The authors lay the groundwork for you, describing the fundamental principles of a successful training event and the personal approach they contend every SME and ID bring to the training table. You&#8217;ll discover how to design learning events with the needs of SMEs in mind. And you&#8217;ll try out best practices for coaching SMEs to deliver training efficiently and effectively. The authors also share detailed and relatable workplace scenarios drawn from their vast business experience as well as job aids to assist you in a variety of learning situations.     </p>
<p>                    Effective SMEs is the rare book that addresses both designing for SMEs to deliver training and coaching them to be effective once they&#8217;re in the training room. Don&#8217;t plan your next live training event without it.</p>

The book that helps you deal with irrational, impossible people. &#8211; Oprah&#8217;s Book Club 2.0 Let&#8217;s face it: we all know people who are downright irrational. No matter how hard you try to reason with them, it never works. So what&#8217;s the solution? How do you talk to someone who just won&#8217;t listen? What can you do with an unrealistic boss, an angry spouse, or an overly emotional friend? You can&#8217;t win by ignoring the insanity-and you can&#8217;t argue it away. But you can stop it cold. Top-ranked psychiatrist and communication expert Mark Goulston shows you how in Talking to Crazy, a life-changing book for everyone trapped in maddening personal or professional relationships. Goulston unlocks the mysteries of the irrational mind, and explains how faulty thinking patterns develop. His keen insights are matched by a set of counterintuitive strategies proven to defuse crazy behavior, along with scripts, examples, and exercises that teach you how to use them. You&#8217;ll learn: Why people act the way they do * How instinctive responses can exacerbate the situation-and what to do instead * When to confront a problem and when to walk away * How to activate the Sanity Cycle-which quickly transforms you from threat to ally * How to use 14 simple, but effective communication techniques, including assertive submission flattery, the kiss-off, and more * And much more You can&#8217;t reason with unreasonable people-but you can reach them. This powerful and practical book shows you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book will change the way you think about persuasion, and have you closing deals in no time.    </p>
<p>                    These days, it&#8217;s just not enough to make a great pitch. Over decades of being marketed, pitched, sold (and lied) to, we&#8217;ve grown resistant to sales persuasion. The moment we feel pressured to buy, we pull away. And if we&#8217;re told what to think, our defences go up.     </p>
<p>                    That&#8217;s why Oren Klaff, bestselling author of Pitch Anything, has devised a new approach to persuasion based on a simple insight: everyone trusts their own ideas. Instead of pushing your idea on your buyer, guide them to discover it on their own and they will get excited about it. They&#8217;ll buy in and feel good about the chance to work with you. In Flip the Script, Klaff breaks down this insight into a series of actionable steps.<br />
                    You will learn how to:    </p>
<p>                    *Achieve Status Alignment: Use a status tip-off, a strategically placed remark that identifies you as an insider who can relate to your client&#8217;s concerns.    </p>
<p>                    *Close the Certainty Gap: Allay your buyer&#8217;s fears about going into business with you by delivering a flash roll, proving your expertise in the domain.    </p>
<p>                    *Present Your Idea as Plain Vanilla: Don&#8217;t overhype your product as a first-of-its-kind solution. The more you emphasise the familiar, reliable elements of your product, the easier you make it for your buyer to say yes.    </p>
<p>                    Packed with examples of the long-shot, often hilarious deals that Klaff has pulled off over the years, Flip the Script is the most entertaining, informative masterclass in dealmaking you&#8217;ll find anywhere. It will transform your approach to pitching, leaving you fully prepared to raise money, seal deals and keep your cool in the toughest business situations.</p>

But whether we are leading or following, what matters most is we get to the truth. We have to develop a commitment to sharing vital facts and identifying faulty assumptions&#8211;it can mean the difference between success and failure. This is why we need Humble Inquiry more than ever.     </p>
<p>                    The Scheins define Humble Inquiry as &#8220;the gentle art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building relationships based on curiosity and interest in the other person.&#8221; It was inspired by Edgar&#8217;s twenty years of work in high-hazard industries and the health-care system, where honest communication can literally mean the difference between life and death.     </p>
<p>                    In this new edition the authors look at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offer examples of it in action, and show how to overcome the barriers that keep us telling when we should be asking. This edition offers a deepening and broadening of this concept, seeing it as not just a way of posing questions but an entire attitude that includes better listening, better responding to what others are trying to tell us, and better revealing of ourselves. Packed with case examples and a full chapter of exercises and simulations, this is a major contribution to how we see human conversational dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, and eminently practical way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether you&#8217;re trying to communicate a vision, sell an idea, or inspire commitment, storytelling is a powerful business tool that can mean the difference between lackluster enthusiasm and a rallying cry. Addressing a wide variety of business challenges, including specific stories to help you overcome twenty-one difficult situations, Lead with a Story gives you theability to engage an audience the way logic and bullet points alone never could. This how-to guidebook shows readers how powerful stories can help define culture and values, engender creativity and innovation, foster collaboration, build relationships, provide coaching and feedback, and lead change. Whether in a speech or a memo, communicated to one person or a thousand, storytelling is an essential skill for today&#8217;s leaders. Many highly successful companies use storytelling as a leadership tool. At Nike, all senior executives are designated &#8220;corporate storytellers.&#8221; 3M banned bullet points years ago and replaced them with a process of writing &#8220;strategic narratives.&#8221; Procter &#038; Gamble hired Hollywood directors to teach its executives storytelling techniques. Some forward-thinking business schools have even added storytelling courses to their management curriculum. Complete with examples from these and many other high-profile companies, Lead with a Story gives readers the guidance they need to spin a narrative to stunning effect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Get heard by being clear and concise The only way to survive in business today is to be a lean communicator. Busy executives expect you to respect and manage their time more effectively than ever. You need to do the groundwork to make your message tight and to the point. The average professional receives 304 emails per week and checks their smartphones 36 times an hour and 38 hours a week. This inattention has spread to every part of life. The average attention span has shrunk from 12 seconds in 2000 to eight in 2012. So, throw them a lifeline and be brief. Author Joe McCormack tackles the challenges of inattention, interruptions, and impatience that every professional faces. His proven B.R.I.E.F. approach, which stands for Background, Relevance, Information, Ending, and Follow up, helps simplify and clarify complex communication. BRIEF will help you summarize lengthy information, tell a short story, harness the power of infographics and videos, and turn monologue presentations into controlled conversations. * Details the B.R.I.E.F. approach to distilling your message into a brief presentation * Written by the founder and CEO of Sheffield Marketing Partners, which specializes in message and narrative development, who is also a recognized expert in Narrative Mapping, a technique that helps clients achieve a clearer and more concise message Long story short:  BRIEF will help you gain the muscle you need to eliminate wasteful words and stand out from the rest.<br />
                    Be better. Be brief.</p>

<p>                    Business communication sucks. At each meeting and presentation, we are inundated with information, leaving us thirsting for inspiration. Sure, we will check off an action item because we have to&#8230;but what if we were actually inspired to do something? What if we were so moved that we wanted to do it?     </p>
<p>                    Leaders must earn the license to lead. Not by expertise, authority, or title alone, but by influence. In Communicate to Influence, you will learn the secrets of the Decker Method&#8211;a framework that has been perfected over the past 36 years. Ben and Kelly Decker add fresh insights to these proven principles so that you can ignite change and inspire action. Discover:     </p>

                    &#8211; The Communicator&#8217;s Roadmap: use a tool to visually chart what type of communication experience you create<br />
                    &#8211; The Behaviors of Trust: align what you say with how you say it to better connect with your audience<br />
                    &#8211; The Decker Grid: shift your message from self-centered, all about me content to relevant, audience-centered content that drives action     </p>

Consider that, in the real world: (1) The best candidates do NOT get hired; (2) The best products do NOT sell the most; and (3) The best workers do NOT get promoted.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffett compares stock trading to great athletes: they excel not because of fast neurological responses, but because of their ability to delay as long as possible before reacting. Successful CEOs, fire fighters, and military officers all know how to manage delay to gather as much information as possible to get the results they need.    </p>
<p>                    In Wait, Frank Partnoy argues that decisions of all kinds, whether &#8216;snap&#8217; or long-term, benefit from being made at the last possible moment. The art of knowing how long you can afford to delay before committing is at the heart of many a great decision, whether in a corporate takeover or a marriage proposal. Apologies are better received if they are not rushed and people who can defer gratification are happier and more successful than those who must have everything now. Partnoy demonstrates that the ability to wait is crucial to getting the right answer and that gut instincts are often wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Top 10 Motivational Books of 2015 &#8211; Inc.com<br />
                    Top 10 Creative Leadership Books of 2015 &#8211; Forbes    </p>
<p>                    Against the backdrop of eroding trust in capitalism, pervasive technology, big data, and the desire to quantify all of our behaviours, The Business Romantic makes a compelling case that we must meld the pursuit of success and achievement with romance if we want to create an economy that serves our entire selves.    </p>
<p>                    A rising star in data analytics who is in love with the intrinsic beauty of spreadsheets; the mastermind behind a brand built on absence; an Argentinian couple who revolutionize shoelaces; the founder of a foodie-oriented start-up that creates intimate conversation spaces; a performance artist who offers fake corporate seminars for real professionals &#8211; these are some of the innovators readers will meet in this witty, deeply personal, and rousing journey through the world of Business Romanticism.    </p>
<p>                    The Business Romantic not only provides surprising insights into the emotional and social aspects of business but also presents &#8216;Rules of Enchantment&#8217; that will help both individuals and organisations construct more meaningful experiences for themselves and others.    </p>
<p>                    The Business Romantic offers a radically different view of the good life and outlines how to better meet one&#8217;s own desires as well as those of customers, employees, and society. It encourages readers to expect more from companies, to give more of themselves, and to fall back in love with their work and their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I like listening to people who know things that I don&#8217;t,&#8217; Gareth Southgate told me. &#8216;That&#8217;s how you learn.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Former Olympian and best-selling author Matthew Syed is one of the advisors Gareth Southgate engaged from outside football in order to find new ways of working as a team. In Rebel Ideas, discover how Southgate &#8216;the man with the plan&#8217; replaced 50 years of hurt with two major tournament semi-finals in three years.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Matthew Syed&#8217;s phenomenal bestseller will change the way you think about success &#8211; for ever.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Syed is a superb storyteller. I couldn&#8217;t put the book down, and I learned so much. A stunning achievement&#8217; Tim Harford, author of The Undercover Economist    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas examines the power of &#8216;cognitive diversity&#8217; &#8211; the ability to think differently about the world around us.    </p>
<p>                    It explains how to harness our unique perspectives, pool our collective intelligence and tackle the greatest challenges of our age &#8211; from climate change to terrorism. It draws on a dazzling range of case studies, including the catastrophic failings of the CIA before 9/11, a fatal communication breakdown on top of Mount Everest and a moving tale of deradicalisation in America&#8217;s Deep South.    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas will strengthen any team or organisation, but has dozens of individual applications, too: from the art of reinvention to the remarkable benefits of personalised nutrition. It shows us how to become more creative, how to collaborate in a world becoming more interconnected, and how to break free of echo chambers that surround us all.    </p>
<p>                    Now updated with a new chapter on the Covid-19 crisis    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A gripping read, full of intelligence and perspective&#8217; James Dyson    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it makes more sense to lose today in order to win tomorrow. What do you do when you know what you want, but you have no idea how to get it?    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;The greatest negotiation book of all time.&#8217; Inc. Magazine<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Never walk away. Learn to listen, then learn to understand, then learn to win.    </p>
<p>                    Negotiation is part of every human encounter, and most of us do it badly. Whether dealing with family, a business, or diplomacy, people often fail to meet their goals in every country and context. They focus on power and &#8220;win-win&#8221; instead of relationships and perceptions. They don&#8217;t find enough things to trade. They think others should be rational when they should be dealing with emotions. They get distracted from their goals.    </p>
<p>                    In this revolutionary and seminal bestselling book, leading negotiation practitioner, coach and professor Stuart Diamond shows how emotional intelligence, perceptions, cultural diversity and collaboration produce four times as much value as old-school, conflictive, power, leverage and logic. Drawing on thirty-plus years of research involving 30,000 people across 45 countries &#8211; ranging from political and corporate leaders to administrative assistants, lawyers, housewives, students, and labourers &#8211; he outlines specific, practical and better ways to deal with others. To this, he adds his 40-year experience as a corporate executive, Harvard-trained attorney, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.    </p>
<p>                    Getting More is based on Professor Diamond&#8217;s award-winning negotiations course at The Wharton Business School, where it has been the most sought-after course by students for almost two decades. It contains a powerful toolkit that can be used in any situation: with kids and jobs, travel and shopping, business, politics, relationships, cultures, partners and competitors. His advice is brought to life in an accessible and entertaining manner through the stories of hundreds of people who have used the toolkit with great success.<br />
                    ________________    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;From advising on how to negotiate with terrorists, to industrial disputes, to children, Diamond&#8217;s twelve rules of negotiation promise to open new doors every day.&#8217; Radio One    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Practical, immediately applicable and highly effective.&#8217; Evan Wittenberg, co-founder of TRUE and former Head of Global Leadership Development at Google    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I rely on Stuart Diamond&#8217;s negotiation tools every day.&#8217; Christian Hernandez, venture capitalist and former Head of International Business Development at Facebook</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone seeking to influence others must first know their own story, and how to tell it properly. Whether you&#8217;re proposing a risky new venture, trying to close a deal, or leading a charge against injustice, you have a story to tell. Tell it well and you will create a shared experience with your listeners that can have profound results.    </p>
<p>                    In this modern classic, Annette Simmons reminds us that the oldest tool of influence is also the most powerful. Fully revised and updated to account for new technology and social media, along with two new chapters on the role of stories in the development of civilization and how to adjust your story to your specific goal, Simmons showcases over a hundred examples of effective storytelling drawn from the front lines of business and government, as well as myths, fables, and parables from around the world. Whether writing a screenplay, or announcing a corporate reorganization, Simmons illustrates how story can be used in ways that cold facts, bullet points, and directives can&#8217;t. These stories, combined with practical storytelling techniques, show anyone how to become a more effective communicator and achieve their goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!!    </p>
<p>                    Named a Best Book of 2019 by TIME, Amazon, and The Washington Post    </p>
<p>                    A Wired Must-Read Book of Summer       </p>
<p>                    “Gretchen McCulloch is the internet’s favorite linguist, and this book is essential reading. Reading her work is like suddenly being able to see the matrix.” —Jonny Sun, author of everyone&#8217;s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too       </p>
<p>                    Because Internet is for anyone who&#8217;s ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It&#8217;s the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that&#8217;s a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are.      </p>
<p>                    Language is humanity&#8217;s most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What&#8217;s more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time.     </p>
<p>                    Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer &#8220;LOL&#8221; or &#8220;lol,&#8221; why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you wish you could decode people? Do you want a formula for charisma? Do you want to know exactly what to say to your boss, your date or your networking partner? You need to know how people work.    </p>
<p>                    As a human behaviour investigator, Vanessa Van Edwards studies the hidden forces that drive our behaviour patterns in her lab &#8211; and she&#8217;s cracked the code.     </p>
<p>                    In Captivate she shares a wealth of shortcuts, systems and behaviour hacks derived from her research, to help you take charge of interactions at work and at home. You&#8217;ll learn how to execute a social game plan to navigate any social situation; how to speed-read faces for 7 universal &#8216;micro-expressions&#8217; that can be used to predict people&#8217;s emotions; and much more besides.     </p>
<p>                    When you understand the laws of human behaviour you can get along with anyone. With Vanessa&#8217;s help, you will never interact in the same way again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally a go-to guide to creating and publishing the kind of content that will make your business thrive. Everybody Writes is a go-to guide to attracting and retaining customers through stellar online communication, because in our content-driven world, every one of us is, in fact, a writer. If you have a web site, you are a publisher. If you are on social media, you are in marketing. And that means that we are all relying on our words to carry our marketing messages. We are all writers. Yeah, but who cares about writing anymore? In a time-challenged world dominated by short and snappy, by click-bait headlines and Twitter streams and Instagram feeds and gifs and video and Snapchat and YOLO and LOL and #tbt&#8230;does the idea of focusing on writing seem pedantic and ordinary? Actually, writing matters more now, not less. Our online words are our currency; they tell our customers who we are. Our writing can make us look smart or it can make us look stupid. It can make us seem fun, or warm, or competent, or trustworthy. But it can also make us seem humdrum or discombobulated or flat-out boring.<br />
                    That means you&#8217;ve got to choose words well, and write with economy and the style and honest empathy for your customers. And it means you put a new value on an often-overlooked skill in content marketing: How to write, and how to tell a true story really, really well. That&#8217;s true whether you&#8217;re writing a listicle or the words on a Slideshare deck or the words you&#8217;re reading right here, right now&#8230;And so being able to communicate well in writing isn&#8217;t just nice; it&#8217;s necessity. And it&#8217;s also the oft-overlooked cornerstone of nearly all our content marketing. In Everybody Writes, top marketing veteran Ann Handley gives expert guidance and insight into the process and strategy of content creation, production and publishing, with actionable how-to advice designed to get results. These lessons and rules apply across all of your online assets like web pages, home page, landing pages, blogs, email, marketing offers, and on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and other social media. Ann deconstructs the strategy and delivers a practical approach to create ridiculously compelling and competent content.<br />
                    It&#8217;s designed to be the go-to guide for anyone creating or publishing any kind of online content whether you&#8217;re a big brand or you&#8217;re small and solo. Sections include: * How to write better. (Or, for &#8220;adult-onset writers&#8221;: How to hate writing less.) * Easy grammar and usage rules tailored for business in a fun, memorable way. (Enough to keep you looking sharp, but not too much to overwhelm you.) * Giving your audience the gift of your true story, told well. Empathy and humanity and inspiration are key here, so the book covers that, too. * Best practices for creating credible, trustworthy content steeped in some time-honored rules of solid journalism. Because publishing content and talking directly to your customers is, at its heart, a privilege. *&#8221;Things Marketers Write&#8221;: The fundamentals of 17 specific kinds of content that marketers are often tasked with crafting. * Content Tools: The sharpest tools you need to get the job done. Traditional marketing techniques are no longer enough. Everybody Writes is a field guide for the smartest businesses who know that great content is the key to thriving in this digital world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Vision . . . All the best business schools, books, and gurus say that leaders absolutely must have it&#8211;so why does it appear that many of today&#8217;s leaders were absent the day that was taught? Because the sad truth is, most leaders today have not developed the visionary capacity necessary to look ahead and explore strategic futures. Or at least their so-called vision is not one that compels, inspires, and energizes their people. Vision may sound like a rare quality, attainable by only a select few&#8211;but nothing could be further from the truth. In Anticipate, strategy and leadership expert Rob-Jan de Jong explains how anyone can develop in themselves a visionary leadership. It simply boils down to sharpening two key skills: 1) the ability to see things early, and 2) the power to connect the dots. Using the author&#8217;s trademarked FuturePriming process, which helps distinguish signal from noise, readers geared toward fine-tuning these two basic but essential skills will discover how to: &#8211; Tap into their imagination and open themselves up to the unconventional &#8211; Become better at seeing things early &#8211; Frame the big-picture view that provides direction for the future &#8211; Communicate your vision in a way that engages others and provokes action &#8211; And more When you can anticipate change before your competitors, you create enormous strategic advantage. That&#8217;s what visionaries do . . . and now so can you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Howard Marks&#8217;s The Most Important Thing distilled the investing insight of his celebrated client memos into a single volume and, for the first time, made his time-tested philosophy available to general readers. In this edition, Marks&#8217;s wisdom is joined by the comments, insights, and counterpoints of four renowned investors and investment educators: Christopher C. Davis (Davis Funds), Joel Greenblatt (Gotham Capital), Paul Johnson (Nicusa Capital), and Seth A. Klarman (Baupost Group). These experts lend insight into such concepts as &#8220;second-level thinking,&#8221; the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing. Marks also adds his own annotations, expanding on his book&#8217;s original themes and issues. A new chapter addresses the importance of reasonable expectations, and a foreword by Bruce C. Greenwald, called &#8220;a guru to Wall Street&#8217;s gurus&#8221; by the New York Times, speaks on value investing, productivity, and the economics of information.  ***  Howard Marks, the chairman and cofounder of Oaktree Capital Management, is renowned for his insightful assessments of market opportunity and risk.<br />
                    After four decades spent ascending to the top of the investment management profession, he is today sought out by the world&#8217;s leading value investors, and his client memos brim with insightful commentary and a time-tested, fundamental philosophy. Now for the first time, all readers can benefit from Marks&#8217;s wisdom, concentrated into a single volume that speaks to both the amateur and seasoned investor.  Informed by a lifetime of experience and study, The Most Important Thing explains the keys to successful investment and the pitfalls that can destroy capital or ruin a career. Utilizing passages from his memos to illustrate his ideas, Marks teaches by example, detailing the development of an investment philosophy that fully acknowledges the complexities of investing and the perils of the financial world. Brilliantly applying insight to today&#8217;s volatile markets, Marks offers a volume that is part memoir, part creed, with a number of broad takeaways.  Marks expounds on such concepts as &#8220;second-level thinking,&#8221; the price/value relationship, patient opportunism, and defensive investing.<br />
                    Frankly and honestly assessing his own decisions&#8211;and occasional missteps&#8211;he provides valuable lessons for critical thinking, risk assessment, and investment strategy. Encouraging investors to be &#8220;contrarian,&#8221; Marks wisely judges market cycles and achieves returns through aggressive yet measured action. Which element is the most essential? Successful investing requires thoughtful attention to many separate aspects, and each of Marks&#8217;s subjects proves to be the most important thing.  &#8220;This is that rarity, a useful book.&#8221;&#8211;Warren Buffett</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An invaluable resource for making sense of the world, making good decisions, and placing smart bets. A fast-paced and fun read jam-packed with useful information on every page.&#8217; Annie Duke, author of Thinking in Bets<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Turn yourself into a superthinker and make the right decisions every time.    </p>
<p>                     You want to make better decisions. You want to be right more of the time professionally and personally. However, being more right consistently is a hard problem because the world is such a complex, evolving place. How do you navigate this complexity?    </p>
<p>                     Mental models are decision-making tools that guide our perception of the world and our behaviour in it. They help us understand life, make decisions and solve problems. The best models help us make intelligent investments, develop ground-breaking technologies and even travel to outer space.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Note your frame of reference before debating someone with different political views. If you understand how your perspective contrasts with someone else&#8217;s you can prevent the conversation from getting hostile.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Apply the sunk cost fallacy to the end of a doomed project. Just because you&#8217;ve put a lot of hours into it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to keep going.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Before blaming someone, consider Hanlon&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Try to solve mysteries with Occam&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected&#8217;. When you hear hoof beats, think of horses not zebras.    </p>
<p>                     Building on our knowledge of well-known models such as the Bandwagon Effect or Paradigm Shift and introducing us to the lesser known like the Eisenhower Matrix or the Boiling Frog Symbol, this indispensable book distils the most effective mental models into a single, digestible volume. It will make even the most complex models accessible and engaging to enable you to make better, more informed decisions in every part of your life.<br />
                     ________________    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Internalizing these mental models will help you understand the world around you. Once you can spot them, you can change your own behavior to avoid common traps, adjust how you interact with people to get better results, and maybe even articulate new mental models of the world that have yet to be discovered.&#8217; Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO, Coinbase    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;You can&#8217;t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts. If the facts don&#8217;t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don&#8217;t have them in a usable form. You&#8217;ve got to have models in your head.&#8217; Charlie Munger, vice chairman, Berkshire Hathaway</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to create the most transformative meetings and moments    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Priya Parker has created both an art and a science to gathering in ways that can bring joy and fulfilment to any meeting&#8217; Deepak Chopra     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!&#8217; Chris Anderson, creator of TED    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     </p>
<p>                    Being deprived of gathering has revealed just how important it is to us; to connect with others, collaborate, share ideas and create moving, life-affirming experiences.    </p>
<p>                    At a time when coming together is more crucial than ever, Priya Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that can help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences in their lives, large and small, for work and for play.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her wide expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings &#8211; a court hearing, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp &#8211; and explains how simple changes can invigorate any group experience. The result is a book full of exciting ideas of real-world applications and one that will forever alter the way you look at your next business meeting, dinner party and garden barbecue.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A long overdue and urgent manifesto&#8217; Seth Godin, New York Times bestselling author of This is Marketing</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to make your ideas stick.    </p>
<p>                    “Anyone interested in influencing others—to buy, to vote, to learn, to diet, to give to charity or to start a revolution—can learn from this book.”—The Washington Post<br />
                      <br />
                     Mark Twain once observed, “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas—entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists—struggle to make them “stick.”     </p>
<p>                     In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds—from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony—draw their power from the same six traits.    </p>
<p>                     Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.<br />
                      <br />
                     Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas—and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hilarious and indispensable guide to the weirdness of the workplace from Esquire editor and Entrepreneur etiquette columnist Ross McCammon    </p>
<p>                     Ten years ago, Ross McCammon made an incredible and unexpected transition from working at an in-flight magazine in suburban Dallas to landing his dream job at Esquire in New York. What followed was a period of almost debilitating anxiety and awkwardness&#8211;interspersed with minor instances of professional glory&#8211;as McCammon learned how to navigate the workplace while feeling entirely ill-equipped for achieving success in his new career.  Works Well with Others is McCammon&#8217;s &#8220;relentlessly funny and soberingly insightful&#8221;* journey from impostor to authority, a story that reveals the workplace for what it is: an often absurd landscape of ego and fear guided by social rules that no one ever talks about. By mining his own experiences at the magazine, McCammon provides advice on everything from firm handshakes to small talk in elevators to dealing with jerks and underminers. Here is an inspirational new way of looking at your job, your career, and success itself; an accessible guide for those of us who are smart, talented, and ambitious but who aren&#8217;t well-&#8220;leveraged&#8221; and don&#8217;t quite feel prepared for success . . . or know what to do once we&#8217;ve made it.  *Entertainment Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-time Moth GrandSLAM winner and bestselling novelist shows how to tell a great story &#8212; and why doing so matters.    </p>
<p>                     Whether we realize it or not, we are always telling stories. On a first date or job interview, at a sales presentation or therapy appointment, with family or friends, we are constantly narrating events and interpreting emotions and actions. In this compelling book, storyteller extraordinaire Matthew Dicks presents wonderfully straightforward and engaging tips and techniques for constructing, telling, and polishing stories that will hold the attention of your audience (no matter how big or small). He shows that anyone can learn to be an appealing storyteller, that everyone has something &#8220;storyworthy&#8221; to express, and, perhaps most important, that the act of creating and telling a tale is a powerful way of understanding and enhancing your own life.</p>

<p>                    About the Book:    </p>
<p>                    When it comes to delivering a pitch, Oren Klaff has unparalleled credentials. Over the past 13 years, he has used his one-of-a- kind method to raise more than $400 million-and now, for the fi rst time, he describes his formula to help you deliver a winning pitch in any business situation.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you&#8217;re selling ideas to investors, pitching a client for new business, or even negotiating for a higher salary, Pitch Anything will transform the way you position your ideas.    </p>
<p>                    According to Klaff, creating and presenting a great pitch isn&#8217;t an art-it&#8217;s a simple science. Applying the latest findings in the field of neuroeconomics, while sharing eye-opening stories of his method in action, Klaff describes how the brain makes decisions and responds to pitches. With this information, you&#8217;ll remain in complete control of every stage of the pitch process.    </p>
<p>                    Pitch Anything introduces the exclusive STRONG method of pitching, which can be put to use immediately:    </p>
<p>                    Setting the Frame<br />
                    Telling the Story<br />
                    Revealing the Intrigue<br />
                    Offering the Prize<br />
                    Nailing the Hookpoint<br />
                    Getting a Decision    </p>
<p>                    One truly great pitch can improve your career, make you a lot of money-and even change your life. Success is dependent on the method you use, not how hard you try. &#8220;Better method, more money,&#8221; Klaff says. &#8220;Much better method, much more money.&#8221; Klaff is the best in the business because his method is much better than anyone else&#8217;s. And now it&#8217;s yours.    </p>
<p>                    Apply the tactics and strategies outlined inPitch Anything to engage and persuade your audience-and you&#8217;ll have more funding and support than you ever thought possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Segall put the &#8216;i&#8217; in iPad. Now he explains why simplicity is the secret of Apple&#8217;s success in Insanely Simple.    </p>
<p>                    To Steve Jobs, Simplicity wasn&#8217;t just a design principle. It was a religion and a weapon. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. It&#8217;s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011, and guides the way Apple is organized, how it designs products, and how it connects with customers. It&#8217;s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.    </p>
<p>                    As creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple&#8217;s resurrection, helping to create such critical campaigns as &#8216;Think Different&#8217; and naming the iMac. Insanely Simple is his insider&#8217;s view of Jobs&#8217; world. It reveals the ten elements of Simplicity that have driven Apple&#8217;s success &#8211; which you can use to propel your own organisation. Reading Insanely Simple, you&#8217;ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You&#8217;ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A blueprint for running a company the Steve Jobs way &#8230; should be required reading for anyone interested in management and marketing&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Punchy &#8230; Segall gets inside Apple&#8217;s branding and marketing to explain its directness and power&#8217;  Financial Times     </p>
<p>                    Ken Segall worked closely with Steve Jobs as ad agency creative director for NeXT and Apple. He was a member of the team that created Apple&#8217;s legendary &#8216;Think Different&#8217; campaign, and he&#8217;s responsible for that little &#8220;i&#8221; that&#8217;s a part of Apple&#8217;s most popular products. Segall has also served as creative director for IBM, Intel, Dell, and BMW. He blogs about technology and marketing at kensegall.com/blog, and has fun with it all at scoopertino.com.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent estimate suggests that employees endure a staggering 55 million meetings a day in the United States. This tremendous time investment yields only modest returns. No organization made up of human beings is immune from the all-too-common meeting gripes: those that fail to engage, those that inadvertently encourage participants to tune out, and those that blatantly disregard participants&#8217; time.     </p>
<p>                    Most companies and leaders view poor meetings as an inevitable cost of doing business. But managers can take heart: researchers now have a clear understanding of the key drivers that make meetings successful. In The Surprising Science of Meetings, Steven G. Rogelberg, researcher and consultant to some of the world&#8217;s most successful companies, draws from extensive research, analytics and data mining, and survey interviews with over 5,000 employees across a range of industries to share<br />
                    the proven practices and techniques that help managers and employees enhance the quality of their meetings. For those who lead and participate in meetings, Rogelberg provides immediate direction, guidance, and relief, offering a how-to guide to change your working life starting today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The authors of the classic Difficult Conversations teach you how to take criticism productively in Thanks for the Feedback.    </p>
<p>                    We get feedback every day of our lives, from friends and family, colleagues, customers, and bosses, teachers, doctors, and strangers. We&#8217;re assessed, coached, and criticized about our performance, personalities and appearance.    </p>
<p>                    We know that feedback is essential for professional development and healthy relationships &#8211; but we dread it and even dismiss it. That&#8217;s because while want to learn and grow, we also want to be accepted just as we are.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how small changes can make a big difference in your powers of persuasion with this New York Times bestselling introduction to fifty scientifically proven techniques for increasing your persuasive powers in business and life.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Critical communication lessons for sustained corporate success    </p>
<p>                     The Bullseye Principle is the definitive how-to guide for communicating, collaborating, and executing as a leader in the corporate arena. With these &#8220;soft skills&#8221; trending above technical knowledge in executive wish lists, this book provides invaluable guidance for new and experienced leaders alike; from the planning stages to the outcome and beyond, the discussion features critical insight and actionable tips based on award-winning methods. Polish your presence, utilize intention, influence emotion, engage workers, build relationships, make connections, and leverage the power of storytelling-it all comes down to technique. This book shows you everything you need to know to start communicating more effectively, starting today.    </p>
<p>                     The success of any communication rests more on how the information is conveyed than what that information actually is; at every level, in every sphere, effective leaders strive to master key skills that inspire, empower, motivate, and more. This book gives you a solid blueprint for effective communication in nearly any situation, merging the practical and theoretical to help you:    </p>
<p>                    Master the most challenging business interactions<br />
                    Become more influential as a leader and communicator<br />
                    Adopt a 3-step methodology to collaborate more effectively    </p>
<p>                    Build your personal brand and executive presence toward sustained success    </p>
<p>                     Most people believe that their communications skills are satisfactory for their jobs-most managers would disagree. That gap in perception presents a problem that ripples beyond your chances of promotion-where your communication fails, it has the capacity to affect the organization as a whole. The Bullseye Principle helps you build a robust repertoire of communication skills that put you ahead of the pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Words Like Loaded Pistols, Sam Leith traces the art of persuasion, beginning in ancient Syracuse and taking us on detours as varied and fascinating as Elizabethan England, Milton&#8217;s Satanic realm, the Springfield of Abraham Lincoln and the Springfield of Homer Simpson. He explains how language has been used by the great heroes of rhetoric (such as Cicero and Martin Luther King Jr.), as well as some villains (like Adolf Hitler and Richard Nixon.) Words Like Loaded Pistols is a primer to rhetoric&#8217;s key techniques; you&#8217;ll find out how to build your own memory-palace; you&#8217;ll be introduced to the Three Musketeers: Ethos, Pathos and Logos; and you&#8217;ll learn how to use chiasmus with confidence and occultation without thinking about it. Most importantly of all, you will discover that rhetoric is useful, relevant &#8212; and absolutely nothing to be afraid of.</p>

<p>                    USA Today Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    We are living in a world in which cows send texts to farmers when they&#8217;re in heat, where the most valuable real estate in New York City houses computers, not people, and some of humanity&#8217;s greatest works are created by crowds, not individuals.     </p>
<p>                    We are in the midst of a networking revolution&#8211;set to transform the way we access the world&#8217;s information and the way we connect with one another. Studying biological systems is perhaps the best way to understand such networks, and nature has a lesson for us if we care to listen: bigger is rarely better in the long run. The deadliest creature is the mosquito, not the lion. It is the quality of a network that is important for survival, not the size, and all networks&#8211;the human brain, Facebook, Google, even the internet itself&#8211;eventually reach a breakpoint and collapse. That&#8217;s the bad news. The good news is that reaching a breakpoint can be a step forward, allowing a network to substitute quality for quantity.     </p>
<p>                    In Breakpoint, brain scientist and entrepreneur Jeff Stibel takes readers to the intersection of the brain, biology, and technology. He shows how exceptional companies are using their understanding of the internet&#8217;s brain-like powers to create a competitive advantage by building more effective websites, utilizing cloud computing, engaging social media, monetizing effectively, and leveraging a collective consciousness. Indeed, the result of these technologies is a more tightly connected world with capabilities far beyond the sum of our individual minds. Breakpoint offers a fresh and exciting perspective about the future of technology and its effects on all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to master the art of persuasion&#8211;from the bestselling author of Talk Like TED.    </p>
<p>                    Ideas don&#8217;t sell themselves. As the forces of globalization, automation, and artificial intelligence combine to disrupt every field, having a good idea isn&#8217;t good enough. Mastering the ancient art of persuasion is the key to standing out, getting ahead, and achieving greatness in the modern world. Communication is no longer a &#8220;soft&#8221; skill&#8211;it is the human edge that will make you unstoppable, irresistible, and irreplaceable&#8211;earning you that perfect rating, that fifth star.     </p>
<p>                    In Five Stars, Carmine Gallo breaks down Aristotle&#8217;s ancient formula of persuasion to inspire contemporary audiences. As the nature of work changes and technology carries things across the globe in a moment, communication skills become more valuable&#8211;not less. When people express their ideas effectively, they&#8217;re more likely to win dream jobs, sell products, build brands, and trigger movements.     </p>
<p>                    Gallo interviews neuroscientists, economists, and leaders from NASA astronauts to Navy SEALS. His conversations with billionaires who built companies like Google, Nike and Airbnb reveals how great leaders captivate our imagination and ignite our dreams. Gallo will help you unlock into your innate emotional and social skills, develop your public speaking talent to communicate your ideas with confidence, and build empathy with your listeners. This is your moment. Five Stars is your competitive advantage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why are we captivated by sites like Facebook and Instagram, but couldn&#8217;t care less about MySpace Why do some musicians grow as popular as Beyonce, while others never make the charts Why do some nonprofits, such as Charity: Water, succeed in getting our donations, while other charities are ineffective And why can&#8217;t anyone seem to ever get the attention of their kids    </p>
<p>                    In Captivology, Ben Parr, former editor of Mashable and cofounder of DominateFund, reveals how and why our mind pays attention to some events, ideas, or people and not others. Vividly bringing to life the stories of entrepreneurs, musicians, filmmakers, thought leaders, political strategists, magicians, and other masters of attention, Parr presents a new understanding of how attention works and identifies seven captivation triggers-techniques guaranteed to help you capture and retain the attention of friends, colleagues, customers, fans, and even strangers. These triggers spark our brain&#8217;s attention response systems by appealing to fundamental aspects of human nature.    </p>
<p>                    Combining the latest scientific research with interviews of visionaries who have successfully brought attention to their ideas, projects, and companies (Facebook&#8217;s Sheryl Sandberg, film director Steven Soderbergh, LinkedIn&#8217;s CEO Jeff Weiner, New York Times bestselling author Susan Cain, and more), Parr makes the case that you can rise above the noisy crowd and be heard-without having to shout.    </p>
<p>                    Insightful and practical, Captivology will change how you tell your kid to clean her<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Lyons was Technology Editor at Newsweek Magazine for years, a magazine writer at the top of his profession. One Friday morning he received a phone call: his job no longer existed. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was unemployed and facing financial oblivion. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the nebulous role of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What could possibly go wrong?     </p>
<p>                     What follows is a hilarious and excoriating account of Dan&#8217;s time at the start-up and a revealing window onto the dysfunctional culture that prevails in a world flush with cash and devoid of experience. Filled with stories of meaningless jargon, teddy bears at meetings, push-up competitions and all-night parties, this uproarious tale is also a trenchant analysis of the dysfunctional start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them. It is a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to cash out with a fortune.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; Award-winning actor Alan Alda tells the fascinating story of his quest to learn how to communicate better, and to teach others to do the same. With his trademark humor and candor, he explores how to develop empathy as the key factor.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Invaluable.&#8221;&#8211;Deborah Tannen, #1 New York Times bestselling author of You&#8217;re the Only One I Can Tell and You Just Don&#8217;t Understand  Alan Alda has been on a decades-long journey to discover new ways to help people communicate and relate to one another more effectively. If I Understood You, Would I Have This Look on My Face? is the warm, witty, and informative chronicle of how Alda found inspiration in everything from cutting-edge science to classic acting methods. His search began when he was host of PBS&#8217;s Scientific American Frontiers,  where he interviewed thousands of scientists and developed a knack for helping them communicate complex ideas in ways a wide audience could understand&#8211;and Alda wondered if those techniques held a clue to better communication for the rest of us.  In his wry and wise voice, Alda reflects on moments of miscommunication in his own life, when an absence of understanding resulted in problems both big and small. He guides us through his discoveries, showing how communication can be improved through learning to relate to the other person: listening with our eyes, looking for clues in another&#8217;s face, using the power of a compelling story, avoiding jargon, and reading another person so well that you become &#8220;in sync&#8221; with them, and know what they are thinking and feeling&#8211;especially when you&#8217;re talking about the hard stuff.  Drawing on improvisation training, theater, and storytelling techniques from a life of acting, and with insights from recent scientific studies, Alda describes ways we can build empathy, nurture our innate mind-reading abilities, and improve the way we relate and talk with others. Exploring empathy-boosting games and exercises, If I Understood You is a funny, thought-provoking guide that can be used by all of us, in every aspect of our lives&#8211;with our friends, lovers, and families, with our doctors, in business settings, and beyond. &#8220;Alda uses his trademark humor and a well-honed ability to get to the point, to help us all learn how to leverage the better communicator inside each of us.&#8221;&#8211;Forbes &#8220;Alda, with his laudable curiosity, has learned something you and I can use right now.&#8221;&#8211;Charlie Rose</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Veteran project manager and University of California professor Zachary Wong identifies the eight most common people problems in managing projects and offers a flexible, customizable approach to solving them, based on a lifetime of research. Zachary Wong offers practical strategies, skills, and tools to help project managers diagnose and solve their toughest people problems. Based on decades in the trenches, the book shows how to confront and correct bad behavior, increase team performance and inclusion, turn around difficult people and poor performers, get people to do what you want them to do, boost employee motivation and attitude, reduce change resistance and risk aversion, and manage difficult bosses. Wong believes that the best team leaders are problem-solvers and facilitators, so this book provides problem-solving models and tools to diagnose people problems, and facilitative methods, processes, and techniques to correct them. It&#8217;s an approach that can be personalized to fit any person or situation. Each skill is explained with a well-balanced mix of case stories, examples, strategies, processes, tools, and techniques along with illustrations, graphics, tables, and other visuals to clarify key concepts and their workplace application. To reinforce the most important learnings, Wong includes a Memory Card and Skill Summary at the end of each chapter. Nothing is harder than leading people and managing project teams. Being successful takes a combination of knowing human psychology, organizational behaviors, and human factors; having supervisory, process, and communication skills; ensuring good teamwork, high integrity, and strong leadership; and having the ability to integrate and apply these skills to a diverse work team. The Eight Essential People Skills for Project Management is designed for individuals, team leaders, and managers who oversee and coordinate the daily performance of others and who are seeking solutions that they can apply immediately.</p>

<p>                    In this invaluable guide from two of today&#8217;s most sought-after communication experts, you&#8217;ll learn to master three core principles that you can apply in a wide variety of situations:     </p>
<p>                    Content: Construct a clear and lucid architecture of ideas that will lead your listener through a memorable emotional experience.     </p>
<p>                    Delivery: Use your voice and body in ways that engage your audience and naturally support your message.     </p>
<p>                    State: Bring yourself into peak performance condition. The way you feel when you perform is the most frequently overlooked component of communication.     </p>
<p>                    Accessible, inspiring, and laden with useful tips, As We Speak will help you discover your authentic voice and learn to convey your ideas in the most powerful and unforgettable way possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If Martin Scorsese&#8217;s film The Wolf of Wall Street is about the finance industry&#8217;s greediest adults, Kevin Roose&#8217;s Young Money is a look at those wolves as cubs&#8217; Amazon.com &#8216;Best Book of the Month&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Every year, thousands of eager graduates are hired by the world&#8217;s financial giants, where they&#8217;re taught the secrets of making obscene amounts of money &#8212; as well as how to dress, talk, date, drink, and schmooze like real financiers. Young Money is the exclusive, inside story of this well-guarded world.<br />
                    Investigative reporter Kevin Roose shadows eight rookies as they are exposed to the exhausting workloads, huge bonuses, and recreational drugs that have always characterized Wall Street life. But they experience something new, too: an industry forever changed by the massive financial collapse of 2008. And as they get their Wall Street educations, they face hard questions about morality, prestige, and the value of their work.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A great new read that doubles as a post-crash update to Michael Lewis&#8217; Liar&#8217;s Poker &#8211; Mother Jones    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fun fast read that will make you laugh out loud&#8217; Fortune Magazine</p>

Master marketer Sally Hogshead reveals the surprising answers, providing readers with a framework to fascinating anyone.

The question is, how can you apply these core Advantages to stand out in a crowded and distracted world? Hundreds of large corporations, small businesses, and universities-including Twitter, IBM, Porsche, and New York University-use the Fascinate system to captivate their customers. Why? The answers are in this book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A terrific and timely book that makes a compelling case for fundamentally rethinking how your business communicates. Recommended!&#8221;<br />
                    -Jay Baer, founder of Convince &#038; Convert and author of Hug Your Haters    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Once upon a time, storytelling was confused with talking at people. Not anymore. Shane and Joe are your narrators in a journey that will transform how you talk to other human beings to be more believable, relevant, compelling and unforgettable.&#8221;<br />
                    -Brian Solis, experience architect, digital anthropologist, best-selling author    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Shane Snow and Joe Lazauskas spend the overwhelming majority of their time thinking, writing, and theorizing about brand storytelling &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have to. They&#8217;re smart and they know this topic inside out (and sideways). Read their book. While I can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll rise to Shane and Joe&#8217;s ridiculously obsessive level, you will be infinitely better prepared to tell your own brand&#8217;s story. Promise!&#8221;<br />
                    -Rebecca Lieb, Analyst, Author &#038; Advisor    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Contently team understands the power of story, and how to craft and spread a great narrative, like no other. In an era where brand, design, and mission are a competitive advantage for every business, Contently underscores the importance of stories and how they transform companies and industries.&#8221;<br />
                    -Scott Belsky, Entrepreneur, Investor, &#038; Author (Founder of Behance, bestselling author of Making Ideas Happen)    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to illustrate the power of story telling than by telling great stories. This book should be required reading not just by those with content in their titles, but by anyone in Marketing AND Sales. Then, when you&#8217;re done, give it to your CEO to read&#8230; but make sure you get it back, because I guarantee you&#8217;ll refer to it more than once.&#8221;<br />
                    -Shawna Dennis, Senior Marketing Leader    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Neuroscience, algorithms, illustrations, personal anecdotes and good, old-fashioned empathy: This entertaining and informative tome journeys to the core of how we communicate and pushes us, as marketers and humans, to do it better, &#8220;speeding the reader through and leaving us wanting more.&#8221;<br />
                    -Ann Hynek, VP of global content marketing at Morgan Stanley    </p>
<p>                     Transform your business through the power of storytelling.    </p>
<p>                     Content strategists Joe Lazauskas and Shane Snow offer an insider&#8217;s guide to transforming your business-and all the relationships that matter to it-through the art and science of telling great stories.    </p>
<p>                     Smart businesses today understand the need to use stories to better connect with the people they care about. But few know how to do it well. In The Storytelling Edge, the strategy minds behind Contently, the world renowned content marketing technology company, reveal their secrets that have helped award-winning brands to build relationships with millions of advocates and customers.    </p>
<p>                     Join as they dive into the neuroscience of storytelling, the elements of powerful stories, and methodologies to grow businesses through engaging and accountable content.    </p>
<p>                     With The Storytelling Edge you will discover how leaders and workers can craft the powerful stories that not only build brands and engage customers, but also build relationships and make people care-in work and in life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know that networking is important, and that forming relationships with others is a vital part of success. But sometimes it seems like networking removes all emotions from the equation and focuses only on immediate goals&#8230;whereas the kind of relationships that have true staying power, give us joy, and support us in the long run are founded on simply liking each other.     </p>
<p>                      This book, featuring activities, self-assessment quizzes, and real-life anecdotes from professional and social settings, shows readers how to identify what&#8217;s likable in themselves and create honest, authentic interactions that become &#8220;wins&#8221; for all parties involved. Readers will discover how to:     </p>
<p>                      * Start conversations and keep them going with ease     </p>
<p>                      * Convert acquaintances into friends     </p>
<p>                      * Uncover people&#8217;s preferences and tweak their own personal style to enable engaging, reciprocal interactions     </p>
<p>                      * Create follow-up and stay in others&#8217; minds long after the initial meeting     </p>
<p>                      The worst thing we can do when trying to establish a personal bond with someone is to come across as manipulative or self-serving. Authentic connections go much deeper-and feel much easier-than trying to hit self-imposed business card collection quotas. This book presents a new paradigm that shows how even the most networking-averse can network&#8230;and like it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than half-a-million business leaders have discovered the power of the StoryBrand Framework, created by New York Times best-selling author and marketing expert Donald Miller. And they are making millions.    </p>
<p>                    If you use the wrong words to talk about your product, nobody will buy it. Marketers and business owners struggle to effectively connect with their customers, costing them and their companies millions in lost revenue.    </p>
<p>                    In a world filled with constant, on-demand distractions, it has become near-impossible for business owners to effectively cut through the noise to reach their customers, something Donald Miller knows first-hand. In this book, he shares the proven system he has created to help you engage and truly influence customers.    </p>
<p>                    The StoryBrand process is a proven solution to the struggle business leaders face when talking about their companies. Without a clear, distinct message, customers will not understand what you can do for them and are unwilling to engage, causing you to lose potential sales, opportunities for customer engagement, and much more.    </p>
<p>                    In Building a StoryBrand, Donald Miller teaches marketers and business owners to use the seven universal elements of powerful stories to dramatically improve how they connect with customers and grow their businesses.    </p>
<p>                    His proven process has helped thousands of companies engage with their existing customers, giving them the ultimate competitive advantage. Building a StoryBrand does this by teaching you:    </p>
<p>                    The seven universal story points all humans respond to;<br />
                    The real reason customers make purchases;<br />
                    How to simplify a brand message so people understand it; and<br />
                    How to create the most effective messaging for websites, brochures, and social media.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you are the marketing director of a multibillion-dollar company, the owner of a small business, a politician running for office, or the lead singer of a rock band, Building a StoryBrand will forever transform the way you talk about who you are, what you do, and the unique value you bring to your customers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether selling, managing, applying to university, looking for a job &#8211; or looking for a soulmate &#8211; the secret of success is connecting with other people. Nicholas Boothman shows exactly how to make the best out of any relationship&#8217;s most critical moment &#8211; those first 90 seconds that make up a first impression. Armed with his program, readers learn how to establish immediate trust by synchronizing voice tone and body language; the power of a Really Useful Attitude; and how to get people talking and keep them talking. He discusses eye cues, the magic of opposites attracting, and sensory preferences &#8211; some of us are Visual people, others are Kinesthetic (responding most to the sense of touch), and a few are Auditory. So when you say &#8220;I see what you mean&#8221; to a Visual, you&#8217;re really speaking his or her language.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. That&#8217;s because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts so we sound smart and in control and so we fit into society.     </p>
<p>                     But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How do we get unstuck?     </p>
<p>                     For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique he&#8217;s used for years to solve all types of business problems and generate ideas for books, articles, and blog posts.     </p>
<p>                     Freewriting is deceptively simple: start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor won&#8217;t be able to keep up with your output&#8211;you&#8217;ll generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldn&#8217;t have created any other way.     </p>
<p>                     Levy shares his six secrets to freewriting as well as fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepower&#8211;seven of which are new to this edition. Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your raw freewriting into something you can share with the world.</p>

<p>                    Confident communication is a skill, and anyone can learn how to do it.    </p>
<p>                    In Steal the Show, New York Times best-selling author, top-rated corporate speaker, and former professional actor Michael Port teaches you how to make the most of your own moments in the spotlight. He makes it easy to give your presentations a clear focus, engage your listeners, manage your nerves, play the right role in every situation to give your message maximum impact, and much more.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his MFA training at the prestigious Graduate Acting Program at New York University, Port has engineered a system that the non-actor can use to ensure his or her voice is heard when it matters most.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nation&#8217;s premier communications expert shares his wisdom on how the words we choose can change the course of business, of politics, and of life in this country    </p>
<p>                     In Words That Work, Luntz offers a behind-the-scenes look at how the tactical use of words and phrases affects what we buy, who we vote for, and even what we believe in. With chapters like The Ten Rules of Successful Communication and The 21 Words and Phrases for the 21st Century, he examines how choosing the right words is essential.    </p>
<p>                     Nobody is in a better position to explain than Frank Luntz: He has used his knowledge of words to help more than two dozen Fortune 500 companies grow. Hell tell us why Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s six-billion-dollar decision to buy DirectTV was smart because satellite was more cutting edge than digital cable, and why pharmaceutical companies transitioned their message from treatment to prevention and wellness.    </p>
<p>                     If you ever wanted to learn how to talk your way out of a traffic ticket or talk your way into a raise, this book&#8217;s for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A guide for using body language to lead more effectively Aspiring and seasoned leaders have been trained to manage their leadership communication in many important ways. And yet, all their efforts to communicate effectively can be derailed by even the smallest nonverbal gestures such as the way they sit in a business meeting, or stand at the podium at a speaking engagement. In The Silent Language of Leaders, Goman explains that personal space, physical gestures, posture, facial expressions, and eye contact communicate louder than words and, thus, can be used strategically to help leaders manage, motivate, lead global teams, and communicate clearly in the digital age. * Draws on compelling psychological and neuroscience research to show leaders how to adjust their body language for maximum effect.<br />
                    * Stands out as the only book to address specifically how leaders can use body language to increase their effectiveness * Goman, a respected management coach, is widely considered as the expert in body language issues in the workplace The Silent Language of Leaders will show readers how to take advantage of the most underused skills in the leadership toolkit nonverbal skills to improve their credibility and stay ahead of the curve.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A fascinating survey of the digital age . . . An eye-opening paean to possibility.&#8221; &#8211;The Boston Globe &#8220;Mr. Shirky writes cleanly and convincingly about the intersection of technological innovation and social change.&#8221; &#8211;New York Observer An extraordinary exploration of how technology can empower social and political organizers For the first time in history, the tools for cooperating on a global scale are not solely in the hands of governments or institutions. The spread of the internet and mobile phones are changing how people come together and get things done&#8211;and sparking a revolution that, as Clay Shirky shows, is changing what we do, how we do it, and even who we are. Here, we encounter a whoman who loses her phone and recruits an army of volunteers to get it back from the person who stole it. A dissatisfied airline passenger who spawns a national movement by taking her case to the web. And a handful of kids in Belarus who create a political protest that the state is powerless to stop. Here Comes Everybody is a revelatory examination of how the wildfirelike spread of new forms of social interaction enabled by technology is changing the way humans form groups and exist within them. A revolution in social organization has commenced, and Clay Shirky is its brilliant chronicler.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Marquet is the kind of leader who comes around only once in a generation &#8230; his ideas and lessons are invaluable&#8217; Simon Sinek, author of Start With Why    </p>
<p>                    Captain David Marquet was used to giving orders. In the high-stress environment of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, it was crucial his men did their job well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance and the worst retention in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    One day, Marquet unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. He realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things.     </p>
<p>                    Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Before long, his crew became fully engaged and the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet&#8217;s approach to create a workplace where everyone takes responsibility for their actions, people are healthier and happier &#8211; and everyone is a leader.    </p>
<p>                    In his latest book, Leadership is Language, Marquet builds on what he teaches in Turn the Ship Around!, showing us how to lead our teams to success through the language that we use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This &#8220;brilliant and provocative&#8221; (Walter Isaacson) guide shares nine principles to adapt and survive the technological changes shaping our future from the director of the MIT Media Lab and a veteran Wired journalist.  The world is more complex and volatile today than at any other time in our history. The tools of our modern existence are getting faster, cheaper, and smaller at an exponential rate, transforming every aspect of society, from business to culture and from the public sphere to our most private moments. The people who succeed will be the ones who learn to think differently.  In Whiplash, Joi Ito and Jeff Howe distill that logic into nine organizing principles for navigating and surviving this tumultuous period: Emergence over Authority Pull over Push Compasses over Maps Risk over Safety Disobedience over Compliance Practice over Theory Diversity over Ability Resilience over Strength Systems over Objects   Filled with incredible case studies and cutting-edge research and philosophies from the MIT Media Lab and beyond, Whiplash will help you adapt and succeed in this unpredictable world.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Macdonald zeros in on the slipperiness of factuality, offering an array of case studies from the worlds of history, commerce and &#8211; of course &#8211; politics.&#8217; New York Times     </p>
<p>                    True or false?  It&#8217;s rarely that simple.    </p>
<p>                    There is always more than one truth in every story.  Eating meat is nutritious but it&#8217;s also damaging to the environment.  The Internet disseminates knowledge but it also spreads hatred.  As communicators, we select the truths that are most useful to our agenda.    </p>
<p>                    We can select truths constructively to inspire nations, encourage children, and drive progressive change.  Or we can select truths that give a false impression of reality, misleading people without actually lying.  Others can do the same, motivating or deceiving us with the truth.      </p>
<p>                    In Truth, communications strategy expert Hector Macdonald explores how truth is used and abused in politics, business, the media and everyday life.   Combining great storytelling with practical takeaways and a litany of fascinating, funny and insightful case studies, Truth is a chilling and engaging read about how profoundly our mindsets and actions are influenced by the truths that those around us choose to tell.    </p>
<p>                    For fans of Factfulness, A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics and The Art of Thinking Clearly, a fascinating dive into the many ways in which &#8216;competing truths&#8217; shape our opinions, behaviours and beliefs.</p>

<p>                    Success in life is more than having goals and skills. You need connections. And to get connections, you need to Reach Out-fearlessly, strategically, and every day of the work week.     </p>
<p>                    For many, this is a daunting and confusing task.     </p>
<p>                    Reach Out shows readers how to use social media and simple digital tools to begin building and expanding the number of people they know. Author Molly Beck explains how to:    </p>
<p>                    *Establish and strengthen your digital presence     </p>
<p>                    *Develop career goals that Reaching Out can help you obtain     </p>
<p>                    *Think strategically about who you have already met, who you could strengthen a relationship with, and who your current connections know    </p>
<p>                    *Determine who to Reach Out to and push past common networking fears to do it    </p>
<p>                    * Apply step-by-step instructions on how to craft email and social media messages to those you want to connect with    </p>
<p>                    *Optimize your efforts by managing both your time and your inbox     </p>
<p>                    The book features personal stories on networking from some of today&#8217;s top thought leaders. Studies, statistics, and real world examples illustrate the key concepts of Reaching Out. Whether you&#8217;re just starting out, changing jobs, or well-established and just eager to know more people, Reaching Out will help you turn career dreams into professional success by helping you connect with others who can put you on the fast track.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>____________________________<br />
                    Why can some people effortlessly command the attention of everyone in the room?    </p>
<p>                    What makes some individuals seem immediately credible and others appear inherently untrustworthy?    </p>
<p>                    And how is it that precisely the same idea can be enthusiastically embraced or roundly rejected depending on who has put it forward?    </p>
<p>                    When we talk to others, we assume that they are carefully weighing our words and arguments. But these are far from  being the only factors that hold sway.    </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking new book, bestselling behavioural scientists Stephen Martin and Joseph Marks explore the eight powerful human traits that help determine whether what we have to say gets heard or lands on deaf ears. They show how seemingly irrelevant details about our demeanour influence others&#8217; responses. They explain how trust is won, even when it may not be deserved. They show how the most trivial of signals &#8211; like the shape of our face, the shoes we wear or the car we drive &#8211; can influence how people respond to us.    </p>
<p>                    And in a world of uncertainty and fake news they demonstrate how, increasingly, the Messenger is the Message.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Some books make us better citizens. Others make us better at our jobs. This amazing book does both!&#8217;<br />
                    Dan Pink, author of When, Drive and To Sell is Human<br />
                    ____________________________<br />
                    &#8216;A tour de force. Timely and thoroughly researched.&#8217;<br />
                    Professor Robert Cialdini, author of Influence and Pre-suasion    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Messengers is engaging, informative and entertaining. It will change the way you think about who you follow and take advice from. But why would you listen to me? Read their book to find out.&#8217;<br />
                    Professor Tali Sharot, author of The Optimism Bias and The Influential Mind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A powerful, profoundly illuminating exploration of one of the most important subjects of our time. Martin and Marks have a terrific talent for combining evidence and research with lively and vivid writing. Trust these messengers!&#8217;<br />
                    Cass R. Sunstein, Robert Walmsley University Professor, Harvard University, and author of Conformity    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Messengers is a crucial reminder that the messenger is as important as the message. Superficial indicators count.&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An excellent business plan impresses financial backers, provides a clear blueprint for the future of your company and functions as a benchmark against which to measure future growth. How to Prepare a Business Plan explains the process of creating an excellent business plan in an engaging and accessible way. It includes essential coverage of producing cash flow forecasts, planning a business expansion, planning your borrowing and monitoring business progress.     </p>
<p>                    Global case studies containing real business plans provide inspiration and real-life practical insight by analyzing the plans, monitoring the business&#8217; progress and discussing their problems.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not just the most insightful book  ever written on public speaking-it&#8217;s also a brilliant, profound look at  how to communicate&#8217; &#8211; Adam Grant, author of ORIGINALS    </p>

<p>                    Anderson shares his five key techniques to presentation success: Connection, Narration, Explanation, Persuasion and Revelation (plus the three to avoid). He also answers the most frequently asked questions about giving a talk, from &#8216;What should I wear?&#8217; to &#8216;How do I handle my nerves?&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    Ted Talks is also full of presentation tips from such TED notable speakers as Sir Ken Robinson, Bill Gates, Mary Roach, Amy Cuddy, Elizabeth Gilbert, Dan Gilbert, Amanda Palmer, Matt Ridley and many more. This is a lively, fun read with great practical application from the man who knows what goes into a truly memorable speech. In Ted Talks Anderson pulls back the TED curtain for anyone who wants to learn how to prepare an exceptional presentation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It con­verts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes skeptics and cynics into believers and the undecided into the loyal.    </p>
<p>                    Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it&#8217;s more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.    </p>
<p>                    Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A breakthrough book on the transformative power of collaborative thinking    </p>
<p>                     Collaborative intelligence, or CQ, is a measure of our ability to think with others on behalf of what matters to us all. It is emerging as a new professional currency at a time when the way we think, interact, and innovate is shifting. In the past, &#8220;market share&#8221; companies ruled by hierarchy and topdown leadership. Today, the new market leaders are &#8220;mind share&#8221; companies, where influence is more important than power, and success relies on collaboration and the ability to inspire.    </p>
<p>                    Collaborative Intelligence is the culmination of more than fifty years of original research that draws on Dawna Markova&#8217;s background in cognitive neuroscience and her most recent work, with Angie McArthur, as a &#8220;Professional Thinking Partner&#8221; to some of the world&#8217;s top CEOs and creative professionals. Markova and McArthur are experts at getting brilliant yet difficult people to think together. They have been brought in to troubleshoot for Fortune 500 leaders in crisis and managers struggling to inspire their teams. When asked about their biggest challenges at work, Markova and McArthur&#8217;s clients all cite a common problem: other people. This response reflects the way we have been taught to focus on the gulfs between us rather than valuing our intellectual diversity&#8211;that is, the ways in which each of us is uniquely gifted, how we process information and frame questions, what kind of things deplete us, and what engages and inspires us. Through a series of practices and strategies, the authors teach us how to recognize our own mind patterns and map the talents of our teams, with the goal of embarking together on an aligned course of action and influence. In Markova and McArthur&#8217;s experience, managers who appreciate intellectual diversity will lead their teams to innovation; employees who understand it will thrive because they are in touch with their strengths; and an entire team who understands it will come together to do their best work in a symphony of collaboration, their individual strengths working in harmony like an orchestra or a high-performing sports team. Praise for Collaborative Intelligence    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Rooted in the latest neuroscience on the nature of collaboration, Collaborative Intelligence celebrates the power of working and thinking together at the highest levels of business and politics, and in the smallest aspects of our everyday lives. Dawna Markova and Angie McArthur show us that our ability to collaborate is not only a measure of intelligence, but essential to solving the world&#8217;s problems and seeing the possibilities in ourselves and others.&#8221;&#8211;Arianna Huffington  &#8220;This inspiring book teaches you how to align your intention with the intention of others, and how, through shared strengths and talents, you have every right to expect greatness and set the highest goals and expectations.&#8221;&#8211;Deepak Chopra  &#8220;Everyone talks about collaboration today, but the rhetoric typically outweighs the reality. Collaborative Intelligence offers tangible tools for those serious about becoming &#8216;system leaders&#8217; who can close the gap and make collaboration real.&#8221;&#8211;Peter M. Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I have worked with Markova and McArthur for several years, focusing on achieving better results through intellectual diversity. Their approach has encouraged more candid debate and collaborative behavior within the team. The team, not individuals, becomes the hero.&#8221;&#8211;Al Carey, CEO, PepsiCo</p>

                      The number one mistake that managers make during 1-on-1&#8217;s, and the one simple word that can fix it all<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the pivotal moments of our lives, results are often determined not only by our actions but also by our words. Saying the right thing the right way can make the difference between sealing the deal or losing the account, advancing your career or suffering a demotion.  In these moments, it&#8217;s important to be pitch perfect-to use precisely the right tone to convey the right message to the right person at the right time. In Pitch Perfect, the renowned media coach Bill McGowan shows you how to craft just the right message. Along the way, McGowan lays out his Seven Principles of Persuasion, which are as easy to learn, implement, and master as they are effective. The right language-both verbal and nonverbal-can make you more confident, persuasive, and certain. It can stir people to listen closely to your every word and to remember you long after you&#8217;ve left the room.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you &#8220;leadership material?&#8221; More importantly, do others perceive you to be? Sylvia Ann Hewlett, a noted expert on workplace power and influence, shows you how to identify and embody the Executive Presence (EP) that you need to succeed.  You can have the experience and qualifications of a leader, but without executive presence, you won&#8217;t advance. EP is an amalgam of qualities that true leaders exude, a presence that telegraphs you&#8217;re in charge or deserve to be. Articulating those qualities isn&#8217;t easy, however.  Based on a nationwide survey of college graduates working across a range of sectors and occupations, Sylvia Hewlett and the Center for Talent Innovation discovered that EP is a dynamic, cohesive mix of appearance, communication, and gravitas. While these elements are not equal, to have true EP, you must know how to use all of them to your advantage.  Filled with eye-opening insights, analysis, and practical advice for both men and women, mixed with illustrative examples from executives learning to use the EP, Executive Presence will help you make the leap from working like an executive to feeling like an executive.</p>
