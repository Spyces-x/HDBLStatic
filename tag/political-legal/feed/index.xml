										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Best book ever!&#8217; &#8211; 5-star reader review</p>
<p>Theodore Boone, young lawyer, has had a lot to deal with in his thirteen years, everything from kidnapping to murder. But he&#8217;s come through it all and, with the law on his side, justice has always prevailed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the law doesn&#8217;t seem so just. His friend Hardie Quinn is about to have his family home bulldozed to make way for a bypass. Hardie is not the only one affected: other homes, businesses and schools lie in the path of the road. Theo has to tell his friend the bad news: for once, the law isn&#8217;t on his side, and there&#8217;s very little anyone can do to end the destruction.</p>
<p>Theo joins the campaign to stop the road. But when he stumbles on a terrible secret about the corrupt men behind the plan  &#8211; a secret it is illegal for him to know &#8211;  Theo must figure out how to keep the developers from breaking the law . . . without breaking it himself.</p>

<p>                    Did J. Edgar Hoover die a natural death? Or was he murdered? When a group of high-minded and high-placed intellectuals known as Inver Brass detect a monstrous threat to the country in Hoover&#8217;s unethical use of his scandal-ridden private files, they decide to do away with him&#8211;quietly, efficiently, with no hint of impropriety. Then bestselling thriller writer Peter Chancellor stumbles onto information that makes his previous books look like harmless fairy tales. Now Chancellor and Inver Brass are on a deadly collision course, spiraling across the globe in an ever-widening arc of violence and terror. All roads lead to a showdown that will rip the nation&#8217;s capital apart&#8211;leaving only one damning document to survive. </p>

<p>                    Jason Bourne pulls a drowning man from a lake &#8211; a man not only freezing, but bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound. He wakes as an amnesiac, with no memory of who he is or why he was shot&#8230;an eerie reminder of Bourne&#8217;s own past.</p>
<p>                    Meanwhile, Mossad agent Rebekah is so determined to find this man that she&#8217;s gone off the grid, cut her ties to her agency and risks a summary execution if caught by her former colleagues. And back in the US, a new agent has been recruited &#8211; but does he have a secret mission of his own?</p>
<p>                    Everything turns on the mysterious amnesiac. Will Bourne learn his identity or will other, powerful forces get to him first?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>***Perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz&#8217;s Alex Rider series***</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Not since Nancy Drew has a nosy, crime-obsessed kid been so hard to resist&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                     Woody Lambert is in trouble. He comes from a broken family, suffers bad grades at school and his older brother, Tony, is on probation for a drug offence. When Woody inadvertently gets caught up with Tony and one of his friends, Garth, cruising around Strattenburg in a beaten-up Mustang drinking beer, one thing leads to another and Garth holds up a convenience store with a fake gun. </p>
<p>                     Though he had no involvement in the crime other than being in Garth&#8217;s car, Woody is arrested as an accomplice. He&#8217;s going to need serious legal advice to avoid juvenile prison.</p>
<p>                     Enter Theodore Boone: after all, Theo has already decided that he will become the best courtroom lawyer in the state. It&#8217;s just that, at the age of thirteen, Theo is years from being a qualified lawyer &#8211; and Woody needs help right now . . . </p>
<p>                     ***********************</p>
<p>                     Further praise for the Theodore Boone series</p>
<p>                     &#8216;If you aspire to turn your children into lawyers who will keep you in your old age, John Grisham&#8217;s Theodore Boone, his first novel for young people, might be for you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                     &#8216;For any young readers tired of wizards, vampires and Greek gods, there&#8217;s now a new kid on the young fiction block, and this one really does have serious powers: Theodore Boone, half-boy, half-lawyer&#8230; fans will be pleased to know there will be more of Theo&#8217;s adventures to come&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Nobody does legal fiction better&#8217; &#8211; Daily Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Gripping . . . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. I think everyone will be enthralled by Theodore Boone&#8217; &#8211; Scholastic News</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The best thriller writer alive&#8217; Ken Follett</p>
<p>                    The most corrupt judge in US history. A young investigator with a secret informant.</p>
<p>                    Lacy Stoltz never expected to be in the firing line. Investigating judicial misconduct by Florida&#8217;s one thousand judges, her cases so far have been relatively unexciting. That&#8217;s until she meets Greg Myers, an indicted lawyer with an assumed name, who has an extraordinary tale to tell.</p>
<p>                    Myers is representing a whistle blower who knows of a judge involved in organised crime. Along with her gangster associates this judge has facilitated the building of a casino on an Indian reservation. At least two people who opposed the scheme are dead. Since the casino was built, the judge has made several fortunes off undeclared winnings. She owns property around the world, hires private jets to take her where she wishes, and her secret vaults are overflowing with rare books, art and jewels.</p>
<p>                    No one has a clue what she&#8217;s been doing &#8211; until now.</p>
<p>                    Under Florida law, those who help the state recover illegally acquired assets stand to gain a large percentage of them. Myers and his whistle blower friend could make millions.</p>
<p>                    But first they need Lacy to start an investigation. Is she ready to pit herself against the most corrupt judge in American history, a judge whose associates think nothing of murder?</p>
<p>                    Praise for THE WHISTLER</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Grisham really is the master of the legal thriller!&#8217; &#8211; 5-star reader review</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A great read&#8217; &#8211; 5-star reader review</p>

<p>                    In his final hours in office, the outgoing President grants a controversial last-minute pardon to Joel Backman, a notorious Washington power broker who has spent the last six years hidden away in a federal prison. What no one knows is that the President issues the pardon only after receiving enormous pressure from the CIA. It seems that Backman, in his heyday, may have obtained secrets that compromise the world&#8217;s most sophisticated satellite surveillance system.     </p>
<p>                    Backman is quietly smuggled out of the country in a military cargo plane, given a new name, a new identity, and a new home in Italy. Eventually, after he has settled into his new life, the CIA will leak his whereabouts to the Israelis, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Saudis. Then the CIA will do what it does best: sit back and watch. The question is not whether Backman will survive&#8211;there is no chance of that. The question the CIA needs answered is, Who will kill him?    </p>

<p>                    In Chicago&#8217;s top law firm, a young lawyer stands on the brink of a brilliant career. Now twenty-six-year-old Adam Hall is risking it all for a death-row killer and an impossible case: Sam Cayhall is a former Klansman and unrepentant racist facing the death penalty for a fatal bombing in 1967. Cayhall has run out of chances&#8211;except for one: a determined lawyer who just happens to be his grandson.     </p>
<p>                    While the executioners prepare the gas chamber, while the protesters gather, and while the TV cameras wait, Adam has only days, hours, minutes to save his client. For between the two men is a chasm of shame, family lies, and secrets&#8211;including the one secret that could save Sam Cayhall&#8217;s life . . . or cost Adam his.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;Compelling . . . another timely tale from John Grisham.&#8221;&#8211;Chicago Tribune     </p>
<p>                    Michael Brock is billing the hours, making the money, rushing relentlessly to the top of Drake &#038; Sweeney, a giant D.C. law firm. One step away from partnership, Michael has it all. Then, in an instant, it all comes undone.     </p>
<p>                    A homeless man takes nine lawyers hostage in the firm&#8217;s plush offices. When it is all over, the man&#8217;s blood is splattered on Michael&#8217;s face&#8211;and suddenly Michael is willing to do the unthinkable. Rediscovering a conscience he lost long ago, Michael is leaving the big time for the streets where his attacker once lived&#8211;and where society&#8217;s powerless need an advocate for justice.     </p>
<p>                    But there&#8217;s one break Michael can&#8217;t make: from a secret that has floated up from the depths of Drake &#038; Sweeney, from a confidential file that is now in Michael&#8217;s hands, and from a conspiracy that has already taken lives. Now Michael&#8217;s former partners are about to become his bitter enemies. Because to them, Michael Brock is the most dangerous man on the streets.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No one does it better than Grisham&#8217; &#8211; Telegraph</p>
<p>                    He was betrayed by the FBI. Now he wants revenge . . .</p>
<p>                    Given the importance of what they do, and the controversies that often surround them, and the violent people they sometimes confront, it is remarkable that in the history of the USA only four active federal judges have been murdered.</p>
<p>                    Judge Raymond Fawcett just became number five.</p>
<p>                    His body was found in the small basement of a lakeside cabin he had built himself and frequently used on weekends. When he did not show up for a trial on Monday morning, his law clerks panicked, called the FBI, and in due course the agents found the crime scene. There was no forced entry, no struggle, just two dead bodies &#8211; Judge Fawcett and his young secretary.</p>
<p>                    I did not know Judge Fawcett, but I know who killed him, and why.</p>
<p>                    I am a lawyer, and I am in prison.</p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s a long story.</p>

<p>                    One was sent up for tax evasion. Another, for skimming bingo profits. And the third, for a career-ending drunken joyride.     </p>
<p>                    Meeting daily in the prison law library, taking exercise walks in their boxer shorts, these judges-turned-felons can reminisce about old court cases, dispense a little jailhouse justice, and contemplate where their lives went wrong.    </p>
<p>                    Or they can use their time in prison to get very rich &#8212; very fast. And so they sit, sprawled in the prison library, furiously writing letters, fine-tuning a wickedly brilliant extortion scam &#8230; while events outside their prison walls begin to erupt.     </p>
<p>                    A bizarre presidential election is holding the nation in its grips &#8212; and a powerful government figure is pulling some very hidden strings. For the Brethren, the timing couldn&#8217;t be better. Because they&#8217;ve just found the perfect victim&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The partners at Finley &#038; Figg often refer to themselves as a “boutique law firm.” Boutique, as in chic, selective, and prosperous. Oscar Finley and Wally Figg are none of these things. They are a two-bit operation of ambulance chasers who bicker like an old married couple. Until change comes their way—or, more accurately, stumbles in. After leaving a fast-track career and going on a serious bender, David Zinc is sober, unemployed, and desperate enough to take a job at Finley &#038; Figg.<br />
                      <br />
                     Now the firm is ready to tackle a case that could make the partners rich—without requiring them to actually practice much law. A class action suit has been brought against Varrick Labs, a pharmaceutical giant with annual sales of $25 billion, alleging that Krayoxx, its most popular drug, causes heart attacks. Wally smells money. All Finley &#038; Figg has to do is find a handful of Krayoxx users to join the suit. It almost seems too good to be true . . . and it is.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NO. 1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER<br />
                      <br />
                     John Grisham takes you back to where it all began. One of the most popular novels of our time, A Time to Kill established John Grisham as the master of the legal thriller. Now we return to Ford County as Jake Brigance finds himself embroiled in a fiercely controversial trial that exposes a tortured history of racial tension.<br />
                      <br />
                     Seth Hubbard is a wealthy man dying of lung cancer. He trusts no one. Before he hangs himself from a sycamore tree, Hubbard leaves a new, handwritten will. It is an act that drags his adult children, his black maid, and Jake into a conflict as riveting and dramatic as the murder trial that made Brigance one of Ford County’s most notorious citizens, just three years earlier. The second will raises many more questions than it answers. Why would Hubbard leave nearly all of his fortune to his maid? Had chemotherapy and painkillers affected his ability to think clearly? And what does it all have to do with a piece of land once known as Sycamore Row?<br />
                      <br />

                      <br />
                     “Welcome back, Jake. . . . [Brigance] is one of the most fully developed and engaging characters in all of Grisham’s novels.”—USA Today<br />
                      <br />
                     “One of [Grisham’s] finest . . . Sycamore Row is a true literary event.”—The New York Times Book Review</p>

<p>                    When an old comrade Court Gentry thought was dead returns to haunt him, his own life is put in the crosshairs.     </p>
<p>                    The man wants Court to complete a mission, with one crucial catch to his orders: Instead of a difficult assassination, the job will entail a nearly impossible kidnapping&#8211;and Court must return his quarry to the very CIA team that turned on him.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chosen as a Book of the Year in The Times Literary Supplement, the Evening Standard, the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A brilliant novel of deception, love and trust to join his supreme cannon&#8217; Evening Standard</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Vintage le Carre. Immensely clever, breathtaking. Really, not since The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has le Carre exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect&#8217; John Banville, Guardian</p>
<p>                    Peter Guillam, former disciple of George Smiley in the British Secret Service, has long retired to Brittany when a letter arrives, summoning him to London. The reason? Cold War ghosts have come back to haunt him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of the Service are to be dissected by a generation with no memory of the Berlin Wall.  Somebody must pay for innocent blood spilt in the name of the greater good . . .</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Utterly engrossing and perfectly pitched. There is only one le Carre. Eloquent, subtle, sublimely paced&#8217;  Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Splendid, fast-paced, riveting&#8217; Andrew Marr, Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Remarkable. It gives the reader, at long last, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that have been missing for 54 years. Like wine, le Carre&#8217;s writing has got richer with age&#8217;  The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perhaps the most significant novelist of the second half of the 20th century in Britain. He&#8217;s in the first rank&#8217;  Ian McEwan</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of those writers who will be read a century from now&#8217;  Robert Harris</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR </p>
<p>                     The year is 2008 and Samantha Kofer&#8217;s career at a huge Wall Street law firm is on the fast track&#8211;until the recession hits and she is downsized, furloughed, and escorted out of the building. Samantha, though, is offered an opportunity to work at a legal aid clinic for one year without pay, all for a slim chance of getting rehired. </p>
<p>                     In a matter of days Samantha moves from Manhattan to Brady, Virginia, population 2,200, in the heart of Appalachia, a part of the world she has only read about. Samantha&#8217;s new job takes her into the murky and dangerous world of coal mining, where laws are often broken, communities are divided, and the land itself is under attack. But some of the locals aren&#8217;t so thrilled to have a big-city lawyer in town, and within weeks Samantha is engulfed in litigation that turns deadly. Because like most small towns, Brady harbors big secrets that some will kill to conceal. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First published by St. Martin&#8217;s in 1958, Robert Traver&#8217;s Anatomy of a Murder immediately became the number-one bestseller in America, and was subsequently turned into the successful and now classic Otto Preminger film. It is is not only the most popular courtroom drama in American fiction, but one of the most popular novels of our time.     </p>
<p>                    A gripping tale of deceit, murder, and a sensational trial, Anatomy of a Murder is unmatched in the authenticity of its settings, events, and characters. This new edition should delight both loyal fans of the past and an entire new generation of readers.     </p>
<p>                    The characters are as fresh as when they were first created, the tension high, and the cross- examinations and legal chicanery full of suspense. The novel is simply what it says on the cover. A classic. &#8211; Tangled Web    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-CIA master assassin Court Gentry gets hit with a blast from the past in the fourth Gray Man novel from #1 New York Times bestselling author Mark Greaney.    </p>
<p>                    Court Gentry has always prided himself on his ability to disappear at will, to fly below the radar and exist in the shadows-to survive as the near-mythical Gray Man. But when he takes revenge upon a former employer who betrayed him, he exposes himself to something he&#8217;s never had to face before: a killer who is just like him.    </p>
<p>                    Code-named Dead Eye, Russell Whitlock is a graduate of the same ultra-secret Autonomous Asset Program that trained and once controlled Gentry. But now, Whitlock is a free agent who has been directed to terminate his fellow student of death. He knows how his target thinks, how he moves, and how he kills. And he knows the best way to do the job is to make Gentry run for his life-right up until the moment Dead Eye finally ends it&#8230;    </p>

<p>                    Someone is about to make a killing</p>
<p>                    The most daring and devastating heist in literary history targets a high security vault located deep beneath Princeton University.</p>
<p>                    Valued at $25 million (though some would say priceless) the five manuscripts of F Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s only novels are amongst the most valuable in the world. After an initial flurry of arrests, both they and the ruthless gang of thieves who took them have vanished without trace.</p>
<p>                    Now it falls to struggling writer Mercer Mann to crack a case that has thwarted the FBI&#8217;s finest minds.</p>

Discovering a long-buried 1878 treaty with an obscure Indian tribe, the Hawk, a.k.a. Chief Thunder Head, hatches a brilliant plot that will ultimately bring him and his reluctant legal eagle, Sam Devereaux, before the Supreme Court. Their goal is to reclaim a choice piece of American real estate: the state of Nebraska, which just so happens to be the headquarters of the U.S. Strategic Air Command. Their outraged opposition will be no less than the CIA, the Pentagon, and the White House. And only one thing is certain: Ludlum will keep us in nonstop suspense&#8211;and side-splitting laughter&#8211;through the very last page.     </p>

<p>                    Billy Halleck, prosperous if overweight citizen, happily married, shuddered then turned angrily away. The old woman&#8217;s death had been none of his fault. The courts had cleared him. She&#8217;d just stumbled in front of his car. Now he simply wanted to forget the whole messy business.    </p>
<p>                    Later, when the scales told him he was losing weight, it was what the doctor ordered. His wife was pleased &#8211; as she should have been. But . . .    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;No other writer has charted &#8211; pitilessly for politicians but thrillingly for readers &#8211; the public and secret histories of his times&#8217; Guardian<br />
                    ________________________________</p>
<p>                    Nat, a 47 year-old veteran of Britain&#8217;s Secret Intelligence Service, believes his years as an agent runner are over.  He is back in London with his wife, the long-suffering Prue.  But with the growing threat from Moscow Centre, the office has one more job for him.  Nat is to take over The Haven, a defunct substation of London General with a rag-tag band of spies.  The only bright light on the team is young Florence, who has her eye on Russia Department and a Ukrainian oligarch with a finger in the Russia pie.  </p>
<p>                    Nat is not only a spy, he is a passionate badminton player.  His regular Monday evening opponent is half his age:  the introspective and solitary Ed.  Ed hates Brexit, hates Trump and hates his job at some soulless media agency.  And it is Ed, of all unlikely people, who will take Prue, Florence and Nat himself down the path of political anger that will ensnare them all.  Agent Running in the Field is a chilling portrait of our time, now heartbreaking, now darkly humorous, told to us with unflagging tension by the greatest chronicler of our age.<br />
                    _______________________________</p>

<p>                    After Court Gentry was betrayed by his compatriots and forced to take on a near-suicidal covert mission by the CIA, he thought he could find refuge living in  the Amazon rain forest. But his bloody past finds him when a vengeful  Russian crime lord forces him to go on the run once again. Court makes  his way to one of the only men in the world he can trust-and arrives  too late. His friend is dead and buried.    </p>
<p>                    Years before, Eddie Gamboa had saved Court&#8217;s life. Now, Eddie has  been murdered by the notorious Mexican drug cartel he fought to take  down. And Court soon finds himself drawn into a war he never wanted.  But in this war, there are no sides-only survivors&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An innocent man is days from execution. Only a guilty man can save him.     </p>
<p>                    Travis Boyette is a murderer. In 1998, in the small East Texas city of Sloan, he abducted, raped, and strangled a popular high-school cheerleader. He buried her body so that it would never be found, then watched and waited as police and prosecutors arrested Donte Drumm, a local football star with no connection to the crime.  Tried, convicted and sentenced, Drumm was sent to death row: his fate had been decided.    </p>
<p>                    Nine years later, Donte Drumm is four days from execution. Over 400 miles away in Kansas, Travis faces a fate of his own: an inoperable brain tumour will soon deliver the end. Reflecting on his miserable life, he decides to do what&#8217;s right. After years of silence he is ready to confess.     </p>
<p>                    But how can a guilty man convince lawyers, judges and politicians that they&#8217;re about to execute an innocent man?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Mark Greaney, the #1 New York Times bestselling coauthor of Tom Clancy&#8217;s Jack Ryan novels, comes the fifth explosive thriller featuring the lethal assassin known as the Gray Man&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Five years ago, Court Gentry was the CIA&#8217;s best covert asset. Then, without warning, his masters at the Agency put him at the top of their kill list. Court fled his country and became an enigmatic killer for hire known as the Gray Man.     </p>
<p>                    Determined to find out what made the Agency turn against him, he plans to get his hands on the men who sent him on his last mission, Operation BACK BLAST. What he doesn&#8217;t realize is that the questions that arose from his time as an American assassin are still reverberating in the U.S. intelligence community, and he&#8217;s stumbled onto a secret that powerful people want kept under wraps.     </p>
<p>                    The result: everyone has Court in their crosshairs&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the best thriller writers on the planet.&#8221; &#8211;The Real Book Spy </p>
<p>                    In the next thriller in the #1 New York Times bestselling Mitch Rapp series, it&#8217;s a race against the clock when ISIS takes out the entire US power grid and throws the country into chaos. </p>
<p>                    When Mitch Rapp captures ISIS&#8217;s top technology expert, he reveals that he was on his way to meet a man who claims to have the ability to bring down America&#8217;s power grid. Rapp is determined to eliminate this shadowy figure, but the CIA&#8217;s trap fails. </p>
<p>                    The Agency is still trying to determine what went wrong when ISIS operatives help this cyber terrorist do what he said he could&#8211;plunge the country into darkness. With no concept of how this unprecedented act was accomplished, the task of getting the power back on could take months. Perhaps even years. </p>
<p>                    Rapp and his team embark on a desperate search for the only people who know how to repair the damage&#8211;the ones responsible. But his operating environment is like nothing he&#8217;s experienced before. Computers and communication networks are down, fuel can no longer be pumped from gas stations, water and sanitation systems are on the brink of collapse, and the supply of food is running out. </p>
<p>                    Can Rapp get the lights back on before America descends irretrievably into chaos? </p>
<p>                    This compulsive thriller proves once again that the Mitch Rapp series is &#8220;the best of the best when it comes to the world of special ops&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).</p>

<p>                    Philip K. Dick&#8217;s acclaimed cult novel gives us a horrifying glimpse of an alternative world &#8211; one where the Allies have lost the Second World War. In this nightmare dystopia the Nazis have taken over New York, the Japanese control California and the African continent is virtually wiped out. In a neutral buffer zone in America that divides the world&#8217;s new rival superpowers, lives the author of an underground bestseller. His book offers a new vision of reality &#8211; an alternative theory of world history in which the Axis powers were defeated &#8211; giving hope to the disenchanted. Does &#8216;reality&#8217; lie with him, or is his world just one among many others?</p>
<p>                    Philip Kindred Dick (1928-82) was born in Chicago in 1928. His career as a science fiction writer comprised an early burst of short stories followed by a stream of novels, typically character studies incorporating androids, drugs, and hallucinations. His best works are generally agreed to be The Man in the High Castle and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the inspiration for the movie Blade Runner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I couldn&#8217;t help thinking of Harper Lee&#8217;s great American novel To Kill a Mockingbird while reading The Reckoning . . . [Grisham] knows how to spin a yarn&#8217; &#8211; Chicago Sun-Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;May be his greatest work yet&#8217; &#8211; David Grann, New York Times bestselling author of Killers of the Flower Moon?</p>
<p>                    Pete Banning was Clanton&#8217;s favourite son, a returning war hero, the patriarch of a prominent family; a farmer, father, and a faithful member of the Methodist Church. Then one cool October morning in 1946, he rose early, drove into town, walked into the Church, and calmly shot and killed the Reverend Dexter Bell.</p>
<p>                    As if the murder wasn&#8217;t shocking enough, it was even more baffling that Pete&#8217;s only statement about it &#8211; to the sheriff, to his defense attorney, to the judge, to his family and friends, and to the people of Clanton &#8211; was &#8216;I have nothing to say&#8217;.</p>
<p>                    What turned Pete from a pillar of the community into cold-hearted killer? And why won&#8217;t he confide in anyone? All his closest family knows is that it must have been something devastating &#8211; and that the fallout will haunt them, and the town, for decades to come . . .</p>
<p>                    Further praise for The Reckoning</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Beautifully constructed . . . weaves a truly magical spell&#8217; &#8211; Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    &#8216;In this saga of love and war, John Grisham has given us a sprawling and engrossing story about a southern family, a global conflict, and the kinds of secrets that can shape all of us.  From the courtrooms and jails of rural Mississippi to the war-torn Pacific, Grisham spins a tale that is at once entertaining and illuminating&#8217; &#8211; Jon Meacham, New York Times bestselling author of The Soul of America</p>
<p>                    &#8216;John Grisham is the master of legal fiction, and his latest starts with a literal bang &#8211; and then travels backward through the horrors of war to explore what makes a hero, what makes a villain, and how thin the line between the two might be&#8217; &#8211; Jodi Picoult, internationally bestselling author of A Spark of Light and Small Great Things</p>
<p>                    &#8216;When a master of storytelling and suspense takes on one of the most wrenching stories in history, the result is a book that will break your heart, set your blood pumping and your mind racing, and leave you gasping for breath by the final page. I&#8217;m still trying to recover from The Reckoning&#8217; &#8211; Candice Millard, New York Times bestselling author of The River of Doubt and Destiny of the Republic</p>
<p>                     350+ million copies, 45 languages, 9 blockbuster films:<br />
                    NO ONE WRITES DRAMA LIKE JOHN GRISHAM</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW PULSE-POUNDING THRILLER IN THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING MITCH RAPP SERIES</p>
<p>                    When a high-level mole with power to rewrite world order infiltrates the CIA, Rapp must uncover a threat like no other.</p>
<p>                     After a blackout swept the nation, America is resuming life as normal with a new president, one unlike any Mitch Rapp has worked with in the past. As Rapp backs away, the new president, in turn, questions his loyalty.</p>
<p>                     Rapp decides to take a much-needed break. But when it&#8217;s discovered that a mole in the CIA has been digging into their systems for information on Nicholas Ward, the world&#8217;s first trillionaire and the man personally overseeing cutting-edge medical research in Uganda, he is pulled back onto the job.</p>
<p>                     Protecting Ward, Rapp is completely cut off from the agency as he works to identify and expose the mole. But the situation is complex. And the threat is one he could never have imagined&#8230;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Packed with enough suspense to match all the hard-hitting action, Enemy at the Gates ups the ante moving forward, and if you think you&#8217;ve already seen Kyle Mills at his best . . . think again. This one is not to be missed&#8217; The Real Book Spy</p>
<p>                    Praise for the Mitch Rapp series<br />
                     &#8216;Sizzles with inside information and CIA secrets&#8217; Dan Brown<br />
                     &#8216;A cracking, uncompromising yarn that literally takes no prisoners&#8217; The Times<br />
                     &#8216;Vince Flynn clearly has one eye on Lee Child&#8217;s action thriller throne with this twist-laden story. . . instantly gripping&#8217; Shortlist<br />
                     &#8216;Action-packed, in-your-face, adrenalin-pumped super-hero macho escapist fiction that does exactly what it says on the label&#8217; Irish Independent<br />
                     &#8216;Mitch Rapp is a great character who always leaves the bad guys either very sorry for themselves or very dead&#8217; Guardian<br />
                     &#8216;Outstanding . . . Mills is writing at the top of his game&#8217; Publishers Weekly<br />
                     &#8216;Hard to kill and easy to root for . . . plenty of satisfying action&#8217; Kirkus Reviews</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling spy novel The Company lays bare the history and inner workings of the CIA. This critically acclaimed blockbuster from internationally renowned novelist Robert Littell  seamlessly weaves together history and fiction to create a multigenerational, wickedly nostalgic saga of the CIA-known as &#8220;the Company&#8221; to insiders. Racing across a landscape spanning the legendary Berlin Base of the &#8217;50s, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, the Bay of Pigs, Afghanistan, and the Gorbachev putsch, The Company tells the thrilling story of agents imprisoned in double lives, fighting an amoral, elusive, formidable enemy-and each other-in an internecine battle within the Company itself. A brilliant, stunningly conceived epic thriller, adapted as a TNT miniseries starring Chris O&#8217;Donnell, Alfred Molina, and Michael Keaton, The Company confirms Littell&#8217;s place among the genre&#8217;s elite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Best Thriller Writer Alive&#8217; Ken Follett</p>
<p>                    John Grisham&#8217;s legal thriller takes you inside a law firm that shouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>                    Law students Mark, Todd and Zola wanted to change the world &#8211; to make it a better place. But these days these three disillusioned friends spend a lot of time hanging out in The Rooster Bar, the place where Todd serves drinks. As third-year students, they realise they have been duped. They all borrowed heavily to attend a law school so mediocre that its graduates rarely pass the bar exam, let alone get good jobs. And when they learn that their school is one of a chain owned by a shady New York hedge-fund operator who also happens to own a bank specialising in student loans, the three realise they have been caught up in The Great Law School Scam.</p>
<p>                    So they begin plotting a way out. Maybe there&#8217;s a way to escape their crushing debt, expose the bank and the scam, and make a few bucks in the process. But to do so, they have to leave law school, pretend they are qualified and go into battle with a billionaire and the FBI . . .</p>
<p>                    Ingenious, immersive and page-turning, The Rooster Bar is a John Grisham legal thriller bar none.</p>

Steinbeck creates around the infamous Pippin the most hilarious royal court ever: Pippin&#8217;s wife, Queen Marie, who &#8220;might have taken her place at the bar of a very good restaurant&#8221;; his uncle, a man of dubious virtue; his glamour-struck daughter and her beau, the son of the so-called &#8220;egg king&#8221; of Petaluma, California; and a motley crew of courtiers and politicians, guards and gardeners. This edition includes an introduction by Robert Morsberger and Katharine Morsberger.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unburdening, a witness statement and a thriller all at the same time &#8230; electrifying.&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    I have to assume that there is a very real chance that Putin or members of his regime will have me killed some day. If I&#8217;m killed, you will know who did it. When my enemies read this book, they will know that you know.    </p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller. A true-life thriller by one of Putin&#8217;s Most Wanted.    </p>
<p>                    In November 2009, the young lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was beaten to death by eight police officers in a freezing cell in a Moscow prison. His crime? Testifying against Russian officials who were involved in a conspiracy to steal $230 million of taxes.    </p>
<p>                    Red Notice is a searing expose of the whitewash of this imprisonment and murder. The killing hasn&#8217;t been investigated. It hasn&#8217;t been punished. Bill Browder is still campaigning for justice for his late lawyer and friend. This is his explosive journey from the heady world of finance in New York and London in the 1990s, through battles with ruthless oligarchs in turbulent post-Soviet Union Moscow, to the shadowy heart of the Kremlin.    </p>
<p>                    With fraud, bribery, corruption and torture exposed at every turn, Red Notice is a shocking political roller-coaster.<br />

<p>                    Reads like a classic thriller, with an everyman hero alone and in danger in a hostile foreign city &#8230; but it&#8217;s all true, and it&#8217;s a story that needs to be told.&#8217; Lee Child    </p>
