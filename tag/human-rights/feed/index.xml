										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER</p>
<p>                    Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.</p>
<p>                    In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.</p>
<p>                    Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online &#8211; a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet&#8217;s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[The Gulag Archipelago] helped to bring down an empire. Its importance can hardly be exaggerated&#8217; Doris Lessing, Sunday Telegraph</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WITH A NEW FOREWORD BY JORDAN B. PETERSON</p>
<p>                    A vast canvas of camps, prisons, transit centres and secret police, of informers and spies and interrogators but also of everyday heroism, The Gulag Archipelago is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s grand masterwork. Based on the testimony of some 200 survivors, and on the recollection of Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s own eleven years in labour camps and exile, it chronicles the story of those at the heart of the Soviet Union who opposed Stalin, and for whom the key to survival lay not in hope but in despair.</p>
<p>                    A thoroughly researched document and a feat of literary and imaginative power, this edition of The Gulag Archipelago was abridged into one volume at the author&#8217;s wish and with his full co-operation.</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  &#8216;Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s masterpiece&#8230;The Gulag Archipelago helped create the world we live in today&#8217; Anne Applebaum</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Continuing her journey from a deeply religious Islamic upbringing to a post at Harvard, the brilliant, charismatic and controversial New York Times and Globe and Mail #1 bestselling author of Infidel and Nomad makes a powerful plea for a Muslim Reformation as the only way to end the horrors of terrorism, sectarian warfare and the repression of women and minorities.  Today, she argues, the world&#8217;s 1.6 billion Muslims can be divided into a minority of extremists, a majority of observant but peaceable Muslims and a few dissidents who risk their lives by questioning their own religion. But there is only one Islam and, as Hirsi Ali shows, there is no denying that some of its key teachings-not least the duty to wage holy war-are incompatible with the values of a free society. For centuries it has seemed as if Islam is immune to change. But Hirsi Ali has come to believe that a Muslim Reformation-a revision of Islamic doctrine aimed at reconciling the religion with modernity-is now at hand, and may even have begun. The Arab Spring may now seem like a political failure.<br />
                    But its challenge to traditional authority revealed a new readiness-not least by Muslim women-to think freely and to speak out.  Courageously challenging the jihadists, she identifies five key amendments to Islamic doctrine that Muslims have to make to bring their religion out of the seventh century and into the twenty-first. And she calls on the Western world to end its appeasement of the Islamists. &#8220;Islam is not a religion of peace,&#8221; she writes. It is the Muslim reformers who need our backing, not the opponents of free speech.  Interweaving her own experiences, historical analogies and powerful examples from contemporary Muslim societies and cultures, Heretic is not a call to arms, but a passionate plea for peaceful change and a new era of global toleration. In the wake of the Charlie Hebdo murders, with jihadists killing thousands from Nigeria to Syria to Pakistan, this book offers an answer to what is fast becoming the world&#8217;s number one problem.</p>

<p>                    North Korea is Orwell&#8217;s 1984 made reality: it is the only country in the world not connected to the internet; Gone with the Wind is a dangerous, banned book; during political rallies, spies study your expression to check your sincerity. After the death of the country&#8217;s great leader Kim Il Sung in 1994, famine descended, and Nothing to Envy &#8211; winner of the 2010 BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction &#8211; weaves together the stories of adversity and resilience of six residents of Chongin, North Korea&#8217;s third-largest city. From extensive interviews and with tenacious investigative work, Barbara Demick has recreated the concerns, culture and lifestyles of North Korean citizens in a gripping narrative, and vividly reconstructed the inner workings of this extraordinary and secretive country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An urgent and accessible handbook for peaceful protesters, activists, and community organizers&#8211;anyone trying to defend their rights, hold their government accountable, or change the world  Blueprint for Revolution will teach you how to<br />
                     &#8211; make oppression backfire by playing your opponents&#8217; strongest card against them<br />
                     &#8211; identify the &#8220;almighty pillars of power&#8221; in order to shift the balance of control<br />
                     &#8211; dream big, but start small: learn how to pick battles you can win<br />
                     &#8211; listen to what people actually care about in order to incorporate their needs into your revolutionary vision<br />
                     &#8211; master the art of compromise to bring together even the most disparate groups<br />
                     &#8211; recognize your allies and view your enemies as potential partners<br />
                     &#8211; use humor to make yourself heard, defuse potentially violent situations, and &#8220;laugh your way to victory&#8221;  Praise for Blueprint for Revolution &#8220;The title is no exaggeration. Otpor&#8217;s methods . . . have been adopted by democracy movements around the world. The Egyptian opposition used them to topple Hosni Mubarak. In Lebanon, the Serbs helped the Cedar Revolution extricate the country from Syrian control. In Maldives, their methods were the key to overthrowing a dictator who had held power for thirty years. In many other countries, people have used what Canvas teaches to accomplish other political goals, such as fighting corruption or protecting the environment.&#8221;&#8211;The New York Times &#8220;A clear, well-constructed, and easily applicable set of principles for any David facing any Goliath (sans slingshot, of course) . . . By the end of Blueprint,  the idea that a punch is no match for a punch line feels like anything but a joke.&#8221;&#8211;The Boston Globe &#8220;An entertaining primer on the theory and practice of peaceful protest.&#8221;&#8211;The Guardian  &#8220;With this wonderful book, Srdja Popovic is inspiring ordinary people facing injustice and oppression to use this tool kit to challenge their oppressors and create something much better. When I was growing up, we dreamed that young people could bring down those who misused their power and create a more just and democratic society. For Srdja Popovic, living in Belgrade in 1998, this same dream was potentially a much more dangerous idea. But with an extraordinarily courageous group of students that formed Otpor!, Srdja used imagination, invention, cunning, and lots of humor to create a movement that not only succeeded in toppling the brutal dictator Slobodan Milosevic but has become a blueprint for nonviolent revolution around the world. Srdja rules!&#8221;&#8211;Peter Gabriel  &#8220;Blueprint for Revolution is not only a spirited guide to changing the world but a breakthrough in the annals of advice for those who seek justice and democracy. It asks (and not heavy-handedly): As long as you want to change the world, why not do it joyfully? It&#8217;s not just funny. It&#8217;s seriously funny. No joke.&#8221;&#8211;Todd Gitlin, author of The Sixties and Occupy Nation</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praised by the late John Lewis, this is the seminal book about the long and ongoing struggle to win voting rights for all citizens by the president of The Brennan Center, the leading organization on voter rights and election security, now newly revised to describe today&#8217;s intense fights over voting.     </p>
<p>                    As Rep. Lewis said, and recent events in state legislatures across the country demonstrate, the struggle for the right to vote is not over. In this &#8220;important and powerful&#8221; (Linda Greenhouse, former New York Times Supreme Court correspondent) book Michael Waldman describes the long struggle to extend the right to vote to all Americans. From the writing of the Constitution, and at every step along the way, as disenfranchised Americans sought this right, others have fought to stop them. Waldman traces this history from the Founders&#8217; debates to today&#8217;s many restrictions: gerrymandering; voter ID laws; the flood of dark money released by conservative organizations; and the concerted effort in many state legislatures after the 2020 election to enact new limitations on voting.     </p>
<p>                    Despite the pandemic, the 2020 election had the highest turnout since 1900. In this updated edition, Waldman describes the nationwide effort that made this possible. He offers new insights into how Donald Trump&#8217;s false claims of fraud&#8211;&#8220;the Big Lie&#8221;&#8211;led to the January 6 insurrection and the fights over voting laws that followed one of the most dramatic chapters in the story of American democracy.     </p>
<p>                    As Waldman shows, this fight, sometimes vicious, has always been at the center of American politics because it determines the outcome of the struggle for power. The Fight to Vote is &#8220;an engaging, concise history&#8230;offering many useful reforms that advocates on both sides of the aisle should consider&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shocking, heartfelt and well-researched&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A ground-shaping book that defines the edge of so many vital contemporary debates. Hers is a voice simultaneously behind and beyond the veil&#8217; Colum McCann    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating, can&#8217;t-look-away, whistle-stop tour of the Middle East&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brave and impassioned . . . A shocking book, and one that will make anyone who has seen veiling as a cultural issue think very hard about what is really going on&#8217; Mail on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens explodes the myth that we should stand back and watch while women are disempowered and abused in the name of religion.    </p>
<p>                     In this laceratingly honest account, Eltahawy takes aim both at attitudes in the Middle East and at the western liberals who mistake misogyny for cultural difference. Her argument is clear: unless political revolution in the Arab world is accompanied by social and sexual revolution, no progress will be made.    </p>
<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens is the book the world has been crying out for: a powerful, fearless account of what it really means to be a woman in the Muslim world.    </p>

<p>                    &#8220;BEST NONFICTION BOOK OF THE 20TH CENTURY&#8221; &#8211;Time    </p>
<p>                    The Nobel Prize winner&#8217;s towering masterpiece of world literature, the searing record of four decades of terror and oppression, in one abridged volume (authorized by the author). Features a new foreword by Anne Applebaum.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;It is impossible to name a book that had a greater effect on the political and moral consciousness of the late twentieth century.&#8221; &#8211;David Remnick, The New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own experiences before, during and after his eleven years of incarceration and exile, on evidence provided by more than 200 fellow prisoners, and on Soviet archives, Solzhenitsyn reveals with torrential narrative and dramatic power the entire apparatus of Soviet repression, the state within the state that once ruled all-powerfully with its creation by Lenin in 1918. Through truly Shakespearean portraits of its victims-this man, that woman, that child-we encounter the secret police operations, the labor camps and prisons, the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the &#8220;welcome&#8221; that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. Yet we also witness astounding moral courage, the incorruptibility with which the occasional individual or a few scattered groups, all defenseless, endured brutality and degradation. And Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s genius has transmuted this grisly indictment into a literary miracle.    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever leveled in modern times.&#8221; &#8211;George F. Kennan    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s masterpiece. &#8230; The Gulag Archipelago helped create the world we live in today.&#8221; &#8211;Anne Applebaum, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Gulag: A History, from the foreword</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting team, husband and wife Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, take us on a journey through Africa and Asia to meet an extraordinary array of exceptional women struggling against terrible circumstances. More girls have been killed in the last fifty years, precisely because they are girls, than men were killed in all the wars of the twentieth century combined. More girls are killed in this routine &#8216;gendercide&#8217; in any one decade than people were slaughtered in all the genocides of the twentieth century.     </p>
<p>                    In the nineteenth century, the central moral challenge was slavery. In the twentieth, it was totalitarianism. In the twenty-first, Kristof and WuDunn demonstrate, it will be the struggle for gender equality in the developing world. Fierce, moral, pragmatic, full of amazing stories of courage and inspiration, HALF THE SKY is essential reading for every global citizen.</p>

<p>                    The term feminism did not yet exist when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote this book, but it was the first great piece of feminist writing. In these pages you will find the essence of her argument &#8211; for the education of women and for an increased female contribution to society. Her work made the first ripples of what would later become the tidal wave of the women&#8217;s rights movement. Rationalist but revolutionary, Wollstonecraft changed the world for women.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Russian Connection is a story of political skullduggery unprecedented in American history. It weaves together tales of international intrigue, cyber espionage, and superpower rivalry. After US-Russia relations soured, as Vladimir Putin moved to reassert Russian strength on the global stage, Moscow trained its best hackers on US political targets and exploited Julian Assange and Wikileaks to disseminate information that could affect the 2016 election.     </p>
<p>                    The Russians were wildly successful and the great break-in of 2016 was no &#8220;third rate burglary.&#8221; It was far more sophisticated and sinister &#8212; a brazen act of political espionage designed to interfere with American democracy, and at the end of the day, Trump, the candidate with business ties to Russia, won. And millions of Americans were left wondering, what the hell happened?    </p>
<p>                    This story of high-tech spying and multiple political feuds will be told against the backdrop of Donald Trump and his strange relationship with Putin, and his inner circle of advisers with profitable ties to Russia, most notably Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort.    </p>
<p>                    The Russian Connection will chronicle and examine all these bizarre events and relationships, explain the stakes, and seek to answer one of the biggest questions in American politics: How and why did a foreign government infiltrate the country&#8217;s political process and implant its tentacles in Washington?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The War on Journalism    </p>
<p>                    The War on Journalism is a harrowing story of  megalomaniac press barons, conspiracies, sackings, cutbacks, and self censoring journalists, cowed by what legendary investigative reporter Seymour Hersh called ochicken shit editorso.     </p>
<p>                    When first Chelsea Manning and then Edward Snowden blew the whistle, they did more than reveal extraordinary secrets, they struck the first solid blows against centuries old traditions, where journalism was played by agreed rules.  Governments oleakedo secret information to their favorite journalists in return for sympathetic coverage.     </p>
<p>                    Now racked by public distrust, the cash-starved mainstream media  is struggling to survive. Newspapers which flourished for hundreds of years  and TV networks that once ruled the world are in serious decline.   Andrew Fowler gives the inside story on how and why the media helped write its own epitaph. Fowler, an investigate reporter with Australia&#8217;s prestigious Four Corners documentary program for almost 20 years, and author of the international best seller The Most Dangerous Man in the World, the revelatory story of Julian Assange and the rise of WikiLeaks, has pieced together the extraordinary story on the decline of mainstream journalism.    </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s not just the notorious tabloids like Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News of the World, infamous for its phone hacking crimes, which have caused the trouble.  The BBC,  Australia&#8217;s ABC, the Washington Post and the New York Times, and the Guardian, are also in the firing line.    </p>
<p>                    Now the establishment is fighting back with draconian laws to silence the new journalism. From the UK to the US to Australia, governments are harassing journalists, threatening to jail both the whistleblowers and those who publish  their leaks     </p>
<p>                    A battle, shrouded in the cloak of national security, pitting the public&#8217;s right to know against the powerful interests of those who want business as usual, it&#8217;s a stark choice- an increasingly democratic world, or one dominated by executive government, often unchallenged and unaccountable, spying on its own citizens and producing fraudulent arguments to fight horrific wars. Just who wins this information battle will not only define the kind of journalism that survives but also the kind of world we will all live in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FINALIST FOR THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD     </p>
<p>                    LONGLISTED FOR THE 2020 ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE     </p>
<p>                    A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Named a best book of 2019 by The New York Times, TIME, The Washington Post,  NPR, Hudson Booksellers, The New York Public Library, The Dallas Morning News, and Library Journal.     </p>
<p>                    Chapter after chapter, it&#8217;s like one shattered myth after another. &#8211; NPR     </p>
<p>                    An informed, moving and kaleidoscopic portrait&#8230; Treuer&#8217;s powerful book suggests the need for soul-searching about the meanings of American history and the stories we tell ourselves about this nation&#8217;s past.. &#8211; New York Times Book Review, front page     </p>
<p>                    A sweeping history&#8211;and counter-narrative&#8211;of Native American life from the Wounded Knee massacre to the present.     </p>
<p>                    The received idea of Native American history&#8211;as promulgated by books like Dee Brown&#8217;s mega-bestselling 1970 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&#8211;has been that American Indian history essentially ended with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. Not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U. S. Cavalry, the sense was, but Native civilization did as well.     </p>
<p>                    Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer has uncovered a different narrative. Because they did not disappear&#8211;and not despite but rather because of their intense struggles to preserve their language, their traditions, their families, and their very existence&#8211;the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented resourcefulness and reinvention.     </p>
<p>                    In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes&#8217; distinctive cultures from first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put the lie to the myth that Indians don&#8217;t know or care about property. The forced assimilation of their children at government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential, intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.</p>

                    Anne Hathaway    </p>
<p>                    ___________    </p>
<p>                    Me and White Supremacy shows readers how to dismantle the privilege within themselves so that they can stop (often unconsciously) inflicting damage on people of colour, and in turn, help other white people do better, too.    </p>
<p>                    When Layla Saad began an Instagram challenge called #MeAndWhiteSupremacy, she never predicted it would spread as widely as it did. She encouraged people to own up and share their racist behaviours, big and small. She was looking for truth, and she got it. Thousands of people participated, and over 90,000 people downloaded the book.    </p>
<p>                    The updated and expanded Me and White Supremacy takes the work deeper by adding more historical and cultural contexts, sharing moving stories and anecdotes, and including expanded definitions, examples, and further resources.    </p>
<p>                    Awareness leads to action, and action leads to change. The numbers show that readers are ready to do this work &#8211; let&#8217;s give it to them.</p>

<p>                    NOT BEING RACIST IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO BE ANTIRACIST.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Transformative and revolutionary&#8217; ROBIN DIANGELO, author of White Fragility    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;So vital&#8217; IJEOMA OLUO, author of So You Want to Talk About Race    </p>
<p>                     In this rousing and deeply empathetic book, Ibram X. Kendi, one of the world&#8217;s most influential scholars of racism, shows that neutrality is not an option: until we become part of the solution, we can only be part of the problem.    </p>
<p>                     Using his extraordinary gifts as a teacher and story-teller, Kendi helps us recognise that everyone is, at times, complicit in racism whether they realise it or not, and by describing with moving humility his own journey from racism to antiracism, he shows us how instead to be a force for good. Along the way, Kendi punctures all the myths and taboos that so often cloud our understanding, from arguments about what race is and whether racial differences exist to the complications that arise when race intersects with ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality.    </p>
<p>                     In the process he demolishes the myth of the post-racial society and builds from the ground up a vital new understanding of racism &#8211; what it is, where it is hidden, how to identify it and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The most courageous book to date on the problem of race&#8217; New York Times    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michael Scott Moore, a journalist and the author of Sweetness and Blood, incorporates personal narrative and rigorous investigative journalism in this profound and revelatory memoir of his three-year captivity by Somali pirates-a riveting,thoughtful, and emotionally resonant exploration of foreign policy, religious extremism, and the costs of survival.    </p>
<p>                    In January 2012, having covered a Somali pirate trial in Hamburg for Spiegel Online International-and funded by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting-Michael Scott Moore traveled to the Horn of Africa to write about piracy and ways to end it. In a terrible twist of fate, Moore himself was kidnapped and subsequently held captive by Somali pirates. Subjected to conditions that break even the strongest spirits-physical injury, starvation, isolation, terror-Moore&#8217;s survival is a testament to his indomitable strength of mind. In September 2014, after 977 days, he walked free when his ransom was put together by the help of several US and German institutions, friends, colleagues, and his strong-willed mother.     </p>
<p>                    Yet Moore&#8217;s own struggle is only part of the story: The Desert and the Sea falls at the intersection of reportage, memoir, and history. Caught between Muslim pirates, the looming threat of Al-Shabaab, and the rise of ISIS, Moore observes the worlds that surrounded him-the economics and history of piracy; the effects of post-colonialism; the politics of hostage negotiation and ransom; while also conjuring the various faces of Islam-and places his ordeal in the context of the larger political and historical issues.               </p>
<p>                    A sort of Catch-22 meets Black Hawk Down, The Desert and the Sea is written with dark humor, candor, and a journalist&#8217;s clinical distance and eye for detail. Moore offers an intimate and otherwise inaccessible view of life as we cannot fathom it, brilliantly weaving his own experience as a hostage with the social, economic, religious, and political factors creating it. The Desert and the Sea is wildly compelling and a book that will take its place next to titles like Den of Lions and Even Silence Has an End.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soon to be a major film, co-written and directed by Angelina Jolie Pitt    </p>
<p>                    Until the age of five, Loung Ung lived in Phnom Penh, one of seven children of a high-ranking government official. She was a precocious child who loved the open city markets, fried crickets, chicken fights and being cheeky to her parents.    </p>
<p>                    When Pol Pot&#8217;s Khmer Rouge army stormed into Phnom Penh in April 1975, Loung&#8217;s family fled their home and were eventually forced to disperse to survive. Loung was trained as a child soldier while her brothers and sisters were sent to labour camps.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first-person account of a 26-year-old who fought in the war in Sierra Leone as a 12-year-old boy.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;My new friends have begun to suspect that I haven&#8217;t told them the full story of my life.<br />
                    &#8220;Why did you leave Sierra Leone?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Because there is a war.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Yes, all the time.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Cool.&#8221;<br />
                    I smile a little.<br />
                    &#8220;You should tell us about it sometime.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Yes, sometime.&#8221;&#8216;    </p>
<p>                              This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. There are more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide and it is estimated there are some 300,000 child soldiers fighting. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.    </p>
<p>                              What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. Ishmael Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve in Sierra Leone, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he&#8217;d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found he was capable of truly terrible acts.    </p>
<p>                              This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear.    </p>
<p>                    ONE OF OPRAH&#8217;S &#8220;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8221; &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR &#8211; The Christian Science Monitor &#8211; Southern Living     </p>
<p>                     Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the &#8220;better angels of our nature&#8221; have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&#8217;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear&#8211;a struggle that continues even now.     </p>
<p>                    While the American story has not always&#8211;or even often&#8211;been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, &#8220;The good news is that we have come through such darkness before&#8221;&#8211;as, time and again, Lincoln&#8217;s better angels have found a way to prevail.    </p>
<p>                    Praise for The Soul of America     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.&#8221;&#8211;Walter Isaacson     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Gripping and inspiring, The Soul of America is Jon Meacham&#8217;s declaration of his faith in America.&#8221;&#8211;Newsday    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Meacham gives readers a long-term perspective on American history and a reason to believe the soul of America is ultimately one of kindness and caring, not rancor and paranoia.&#8221;&#8211;USA Today</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six-time New York Times bestselling author, FOX News star, and radio host Mark R. Levin &#8220;trounces the news media&#8221; (The Washington Times) in this timely and groundbreaking book demonstrating how the great tradition of American free press has degenerated into a standardless profession that has squandered the faith and trust of the public.     </p>
<p>                    Unfreedom of the Press is not just another book about the press. In &#8220;Levin&#8217;s finest work&#8221; (Breitbart), he shows how those entrusted with news reporting today are destroying freedom of the press from within-not through actions of government officials, but with its own abandonment of reportorial integrity and objective journalism.    </p>
<p>                    With the depth of historical background for which his books are renowned, Levin takes you on a journey through the early American patriot press, which proudly promoted the principles set forth in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. This is followed by the early decades of the Republic during which newspapers around the young country were open and transparent about their fierce allegiance to one political party or another.    </p>
<p>                    It was only at the start of the Progressive Era and the 20th century that the supposed &#8220;objectivity of the press&#8221; first surfaced, leaving us where we are today: with a partisan party-press overwhelmingly aligned with a political ideology but hypocritically engaged in a massive untruth as to its real nature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if the new far right poses a graver threat to liberal democracy than jihadists or mass migration?    </p>
<p>                    From Europe to the United States and beyond, opportunistic politicians have exploited economic crisis, terrorist attacks and an influx of refugees to bring hateful and reactionary views from the margins of political discourse into the corridors of power. This climate has already helped propel Donald Trump to the White House, pushed Britain out of the European Union, and put Marine Le Pen within striking distance of the French presidency.    </p>
<p>                    Sasha Polakow-Suransky&#8217;s on-the-ground reportage and interviews with the rising stars of the new right tell the story of how we got here, tracing the global rise of anti-immigration politics and the ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe&#8217;s new far right as defenders of Western liberal values.    </p>
<p>                    Go Back to Where You Came From is an indispensable account of why xenophobia went mainstream in countries known historically as defenders of human rights and models of tolerance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.    </p>
<p>                    In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.    </p>
<p>                    Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online &#8211; a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet&#8217;s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic New York Times bestseller that &#8216;struck the spark that would eventually light the fire of Black Lives Matter&#8217; (Ibram X. Kendi)    </p>
<p>                    Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by Entertainment Weekly&#8217; Slate&#8217; Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217; Literary Hub and Book Riot    </p>
<p>                    Once in a great while a book comes along that radically changes our understanding of a crucial political issue and helps to fuel a social movement. The New Jim Crow is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in   millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in  the Civil Rights movement.      </p>
<p>                    Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States, The New Jim Crow reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By   targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.     </p>
<p>                    A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice, The New Jim Crow is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frontier Justice is a gripping exploration of the world-wide refugee crisis. Andy Lamey presents the story behind the radical increase in the global number of asylum-seekers, set within the historical and philosophical context in which the ideas of asylum originated and evolved.    Importantly, Lamey approaches the issue as a global one, presenting case studies from Australia, North America, and Europe He follows the extraordinary efforts of a set of Yale law students who sued the U.S. government on behalf of a group of refugees imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay; he recounts one refugee family&#8217;s harrowing journey from Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Iraq to contemporary Australia via the world&#8217;s most dangerous ocean crossing; and he explores the fascinating case of Ahmed Ressam, the so-called Millennium bomber who filed a refugee claim in Canada before attempting to blow up the Los Angeles airport.   Throughout Lamey&#8217;s account, he focuses on the rights of people in search of asylum, and how those rights are routinely violated. But Frontier Justice does not merely point out problems. At the      heart of the book is a new blueprint for how the rights of refugees might be enforced, and a vision of human rights that is ultimately optimistic and deeply affirmative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The uncompromising Nick Cohen exposes the reality behind the freedoms we enjoy in the book that won Polemic of the Year at the 2013 Political Book Awards.    </p>
<p>                              After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism, and the advent of the Web which allowed for even the smallest voice to be heard, everywhere you turned you were told that we were living in an age of unparalleled freedom.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;You Can&#8217;t Read This Book&#8217; argues that this view is dangerously naive. From the revolution in Iran that wasn&#8217;t, to the Great Firewall of China and the imposition of super-injunctions from the filthy rich protecting their privacy, the traditional opponents of freedom of speech &#8211; religious fanaticism, plutocratic power and dictatorial states &#8211; are thriving and in many respects finding the world a more comfortable place in the early 21st century than they did in the late 20th.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Malcolm X&#8217;s The Autobiography of Malcolm X was written in collaboration with Alex Haley, author of Roots, and includes an introduction by Paul Gilroy, author of The Black Atlantic, in Penguin Modern Classics.    </p>
<p>                    From hustling, drug addiction and armed violence in America&#8217;s black ghettos Malcolm X turned, in a dramatic prison conversion, to the puritanical fervour of the Black Muslims. As their spokesman he became identified in the white press as a terrifying teacher of race hatred; but to his direct audience, the oppressed American blacks, he brought hope and self-respect. This autobiography (written with Alex Haley) reveals his quick-witted integrity, usually obscured by batteries of frenzied headlines, and the fierce idealism which led him to reject both liberal hypocrisies and black racialism.    </p>
<p>                    Vilified by his critics as an anti-white demagogue, Malcolm X gave a voice to unheard African-Americans, bringing them pride, hope and fearlessness, and remains an inspirational and controversial figure.    </p>
<p>                    Malcolm X (1925-65), born Malcolm Little in Omaha, and also known as El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, lost both his parents at a young age. Leaving school early, he soon became part of Harlem&#8217;s underworld, and in 1946 he was sentenced to ten years&#8217; imprisonment. It was in prison that Malcolm X converted to Islam. Paroled in 1952, he became an outspoken defender of Muslim doctrines, formed the Organization of Afro-American Unity in 1963, and had received considerable publicity by the time of his assassination in 1965.    </p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed The Autobiography of Malcolm X, you might like Nelson Mandela&#8217;s No Easy Walk to Freedom, also available in Penguin Modern Classics.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This extraordinary autobiography is a brilliant, painful, important book&#8217;<br />
