										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praise for The Macho Paradox</p>
<p>                    &#8220;An honest, intellectually rigorous and insightful work that challenges readers to truly engage in a political discourse that can change lives, communities and nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Rosalind Wiseman, author of Queen Bees and Wannabes</p>
<p>                    &#8220;Jackson Katz is an American hero! With integrity and courage, he has taken his message&#8211;that the epidemic of violence against women is a men&#8217;s issue&#8211;into athletic terms, the military and frat houses across the country. His book explains carefully and convincingly why&#8211;and how&#8211;men can become part of the solution, and work with women to build a world in which everyone is safer.&#8221; </p>
<p>                    &#8211;Michael Kimmel, author of Manhood in America, spokesperson, National Organization for Men Against Sexism (NOMAS)</p>
<p>                    &#8220;If only men would read Katz&#8217;s book, it could serve as a potent form of male consciousness-raising.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>
<p>                    &#8220;This book leaves no man behind when it comes to taking violence against women personally&#8230;.After reading this book you can see how important it is to be a stand-up guy and not a standy-by guy, no matter what race or culture you come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Alfred L. McMichael, 14th Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps and now serving as the Sergeant Major of NATO</p>
<p>                    &#8220;A candid look at the cultural factors that lend themselves to tolerance of abuse and violence against women.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Booklist</p>
<p>                    &#8220;These pages will empower both men and women to end the scourge of male violence and abuse. Katz knows how to cut to the core of the issues, demonstrating undeniably that stopping the degradation of women should be every man&#8217;s priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Lundy Bancroft, author of Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unforgettable true story of friendship, loyalty and revenge, set against the unmistakable backdrop of New York City</p>
<p>                    They  were four boys who shared everything &#8211; the laughter and bruises of an  impoverished upbringing in New York&#8217;s West Side. Then one of their  pranks misfired &#8211; a man nearly died and they were sent away to a  reformatory school. There they suffered the worst abuse the guards could  inflict on them. They were forever scarred by their experiences. Eleven  years later two of them became killers for the mob. They met the  ringleader of the guards who abused them &#8211; and shot him dead in front of  several witnesses. No one thought they would see the outside of a  prison again &#8211; but the four friends banded together once more and in one  last, audacious stand brought their own vengeance to the courtroom.</p>
<p>                    Sleepers was  adapted into an award-winning film, featuring Hollywood stars Dustin  Hoffman, Brad Pitt, Robert de Niro and Kevin Bacon. A moving and  shocking coming-of-age story that is a must read for fans of the cult  film, Stand by Me.</p>
<p>                    Lorenzo Carcaterra was born in New York where he still lives. He was a reporter on the New York Daily News before he wrote A Safe Place. His second book, Sleepers, became a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>                              A girl is missing. Five years old, taken from outside her school. She has vanished, traceless.</p>
<p>                              The police are at a loss; her parents are beyond grief. Their daughter is lost forever, perhaps dead, perhaps enslaved.</p>
<p>                              But the biggest mystery is yet to come: one week after she was abducted, their daughter is returned.</p>
<p>                              She has no memory of where she has been. And this, for her mother, is just the beginning of the nightmare.</p>

It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humor in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it.     </p>
<p>                    In the irreverent Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Lawson&#8217;s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments&#8211;the ones we want to pretend never happened&#8211;are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. For every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the dark, disturbing, yet wonderful moments of our lives.     </p>

<p>                    Why does it feel sometimes as if our children have special powers that enable them to tune us out completely? You ask your child to do her homework, get ready for school or bedtime. You think she heard you but . . . no response. You&#8217;ve tried everything&#8211;time-outs, nagging, counting to three&#8211;and nothing seems to work. In this invaluable book, Amy McCready, founder of the popular online parenting course Positive Parenting Solutions, presents a nag-and-scream-free program for compassionately yet effectively, correcting your children&#8217;s bad behavior.    </p>
<p>                    McCready draws on Adlerian psychology and Positive Discipline, which focuses on the central idea that every human being has a basic need to feel connected and empowered&#8211;children being no exception to the rule. According to McCready, when this need isn&#8217;t met in positive ways, kids resort to negative methods. In this book she provides parents with a virtual toolbox of strategies they can use to give their children the attention and power they crave&#8211;and do away with the misbehaving that adults dread.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Finally: an engaging, evidence-based book about how to battle biases, champion diversity and inclusion, and advocate for those who lack power and privilege. Dolly Chugh makes a convincing case that being an ally isn&#8217;t about being a good person-it&#8217;s about constantly striving to be a better person.&#8221;  -Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take, Originals, and Option B with Sheryl Sandberg    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Laszlo Bock, the bestselling author of Work Rules! and former Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google    </p>
<p>                    An inspiring guide from Dolly Chugh, an award-winning social psychologist at the New York University Stern School of Business, on how to confront difficult issues including sexism, racism, inequality, and injustice so that you can make the world (and yourself) better.    </p>
<p>                    Many of us believe in equality, diversity, and inclusion. But how do we stand up for those values in our turbulent world? The Person You Mean to Be is the smart, &#8220;semi-bold&#8221; person&#8217;s guide to fighting for what you believe in.    </p>
<p>                    Dolly reveals the surprising causes of inequality, grounded in the &#8220;psychology of good people&#8221;. Using her research findings in unconscious bias as well as work across psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and other disciplines, she offers practical tools to respectfully and effectively talk politics with family, to be a better colleague to people who don&#8217;t look like you, and to avoid being a well-intentioned barrier to equality. Being the person we mean to be starts with a look at ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    She argues that the only way to be on the right side of history is to be a good-ish- rather than good-person. Good-ish people are always growing. Second, she helps you find your &#8220;ordinary privilege&#8221;-the part of your everyday identity you take for granted, such as race for a white person, sexual orientation for a straight person, gender for a man, or education for a college graduate. This part of your identity may bring blind spots, but it is your best tool for influencing change. Third, Dolly introduces the psychological reasons that make it hard for us to see the bias in and around us. She leads you from willful ignorance to willful awareness. Finally, she guides you on how, when, and whom, to engage (and not engage) in your workplaces, homes, and communities. Her science-based approach is a method any of us can put to use in all parts of our life.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you are a long-time activist or new to the fight, you can start from where you are. Through the compelling stories Dolly shares and the surprising science she reports, Dolly guides each of us closer to being the person we mean to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this masterpiece, Jamil Zaki weaves together the very latest science with stories that will stay in your heart forever&#8217; &#8211; Angela Duckworth, author of Grit    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Scientific, gripping, groundbreaking and hopeful. The War for Kindness is the message for our times&#8217; &#8211; Carol Dweck, author of Mindset    </p>
<p>                     Empathy has been on people&#8217;s mind a lot lately. Philosophers, evolutionary scientists and indeed former President Obama agree that an increase in empathy could advance us beyond the hatred, violence and polarization in which the world seems caught. Others disagree, arguing it is easiest to empathize with people who look, talk or think like us. As a result, empathy can inspire nepotism, racism and worse.    </p>
<p>                     Having studied the neuroscience and psychology of empathy for over a decade, Jamil Zaki thinks both sides of this debate have a point. Empathy is sometimes an engine for moral progress, and other times for moral failure. But Zaki also thinks that both sides are wrong about how empathy works.      </p>
<p>                     Both scientists and non-scientists commonly argue that empathy is something that happens to you, sort of like an emotional knee-jerk reflex. Second, they believe it happens more to some people than others. This lines people up along a spectrum, with deep empaths on one end and psychopaths on the other. What&#8217;s more, wherever we are on that spectrum, we&#8217;re stuck there.      </p>
<p>                     In The War for Kindness, Zaki lays out a very different view of how empathy works, one that breaks these two assumptions. Empathy is not a reflex; it&#8217;s a choice. We choose empathy (or apathy) constantly: when we read a tragic novel, or cross the street to avoid a homeless person, or ask a distraught friend what&#8217;s the matter. This view has crucial consequences: if empathy is less a trait (like height), and more a skill (like being good at word games), then we can improve at it. By choosing it more often, we can flex our capabilities and grow more empathic over time. We can also &#8220;tune&#8221; empathy, ramping it up in situations where it will help and turning it down when it might backfire.    </p>
<p>                     Zaki takes us from the world of doctors who train medical students to empathise better to social workers who help each other survive empathising too much. From police trainers who help cadets avoid becoming violent cops to political advocates who ask white Americans to literally walk a (dusty) mile in Mexican immigrants&#8217; shoes. This book will give you a deepened understanding of how empathy works, how to control it and how to become the type of empathiser you want to be.</p>

                    Is having &#8216;somebody to love&#8217; the most important thing in your life?<br />
                    Do you constantly believe in Mr Right, and that being with him would guarantee you would no longer feel depressed or lonely?<br />
                    Are you bored with &#8216;nice guys&#8217; who are open, honest and dependable?     </p>
<p>                    If being in love means being in pain, this book was written for you. Leading relationship and marriage therapist Robin Norwood describes loving too much as a pattern of thoughts and behaviour, which certain women develop as a response to problems from childhood.     </p>
<p>                    Many women find themselves repeatedly drawn into unhappy and destructive relationships with men. They then struggle to make these doomed relationships work. This bestselling relationship self-help book investigates and reveals how powerfully addictive these unhealthy relationships are &#8211; but also gives a very specific programme for recovery from the disease of loving too much, a problem that plagues women everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As women everywhere will attest, when it comes to understanding female sexuality, most guys know more about what&#8217;s under the hood of a car than under the hood of a clitoris. And while it seems that men have struggled valiantly since the dawn of time to find ways to reliably elicit the female orgasm, rare is the guy who has the modesty to ask: &#8220;What do I do?&#8221; Ironically, the answer has always been right there on the tip of his tongue.  Welcome to the world of &#8220;She Comes First, &#8221; where the mystery of female satisfaction is solved and the tongue is proven mightier than the sword. According to Ian Kerner, clinical sexologist and evangelist of the female orgasm, oral sex has long been deemed an optional aspect of foreplay, but, in fact, it&#8217;s coreplay &#8212; simply the best way for leading a woman through the entire process of sexual response.  Fun, informative, and easy to read, &#8220;She Comes First&#8221; is a virtual encyclopedia of female pleasure, detailing dozens of tried-and-true techniques for consistently satisfying a woman and illustrated step-by-step instructions to ensure success. These simple methods represent a new era in sexual intimacy, one in which the exchange of pleasure occurs on a level playing field and fulfillment is mutual.  &#8220;She Comes First&#8221; exuberantly offers a fresh new sexual philosophy that inspires every man to make a mantra of Rhett Butler&#8217;s infamous line to Scarlett O&#8217;Hara, &#8220;You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents are facing the toughest challenge of their lives. They want to create a loving family environment filled with mutual respect and cooperation&#8230; but they find instead that human nature and the influence of our culture combine to produce an atmosphere of anxiety, exhaustion, and far too much screaming. Perhaps you can relate!     </p>
<p>                    Whether you scream at your children or not, you no doubt feel anxious about them and their choices. You worry how they&#8217;ll turn out. Unfortunately for parents, many of the techniques some experts present only seem to make matters worse. Hal Edward Runkel has discovered why: Parents are spending far too much time orbiting their lives around their children. They need to return the focus to themselves. They need to grow up and calm down.     </p>
<p>                    ScreamFree Parenting is about taming your reactive responses to your deep anxiety. Rather than learning new techniques, you&#8217;ll discover the liberating principles, based on scriptural truths, that are inspiring parents just like you to revolutionize their family life. Principles that will enable you to remain cool, calm, and connected with your children, no matter what.     </p>
<p>                    Learn how to parent less out of your deepest fears and more out of the highest principles in ScreamFree Parenting.     </p>
<p>                    Special edition distributed through Christian booksellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s busier, faster society is waging an undeclared war on childhood. With too much stuff, too many choices, and too little time, children can become anxious, have trouble with friends and school, or even be diagnosed with behavioral problems. Now internationally renowned family consultant Kim John Payne helps parents reclaim for their children the space and freedom that all kids need for their attention to deepen and their individuality to flourish. Simplicity Parenting offers inspiration, ideas, and a blueprint for change:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Streamline your home environment. Reduce the amount of toys, books, and clutter&#8211;as well as the lights, sounds, and general sensory overload.<br />
                    &#8211; Establish rhythms and rituals. Discover ways to ease daily tensions, create battle-free mealtimes and bedtimes, and tell if your child is overwhelmed.<br />
                    &#8211; Schedule a break in the schedule. Establish intervals of calm and connection in your child&#8217;s daily torrent of constant doing.<br />
                    &#8211; Scale back on media and parental involvement. Manage your children&#8217;s &#8220;screen time&#8221; to limit the endless deluge of information and stimulation.     </p>
<p>                    A manifesto for protecting the grace of childhood, Simplicity Parenting is an eloquent guide to bringing new rhythms to bear on the lifelong art of raising children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This inspirational New York Times bestseller chronicles the lifelong friendship between a busy sales executive and a disadvantaged young boy, and how both of their lives were changed by what began as one small gesture of kindness.     </p>
<p>                    Stopping was never part of the plan&#8230;     </p>
<p>                     She was a successful ad sales rep in Manhattan. He was a homeless, eleven-year-old panhandler on the street. He asked for spare change; she kept walking. But then something stopped her in her tracks, and she went back. And she continued to go back, again and again. They met up nearly every week for years and built an unexpected, life-changing friendship that has today spanned almost three decades.     </p>
<p>                     Whatever made me notice him on that street corner so many years ago is clearly something that cannot be extinguished, no matter how relentless the forces aligned against it. Some may call it spirit. Some may call it heart. It drew me to him, as if we were bound by some invisible, unbreakable thread. And whatever it is, it binds us still.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A story-driven collection of essays on the twelve powerful phrases we use to sustain our relationships, from the bestselling author of Glitter and Glue and The Middle Place  &#8220;Kelly Corrigan takes on all the big, difficult questions here, with great warmth and courage.&#8221;&#8211;Glennon Doyle NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY REAL SIMPLE AND BUSTLE It&#8217;s a crazy idea: trying to name the phrases that make love and connection possible. But that&#8217;s just what Kelly Corrigan has set out to do here. In her New York Times bestselling memoirs,  Corrigan distilled our core relationships to their essences, showcasing a warm, easy storytelling style. Now, in Tell Me More,  she&#8217;s back with a deeply personal, unfailingly honest, and often hilarious examination of the essential phrases that turn the wheel of life.  In &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know,&#8221; Corrigan wrestles to make peace with uncertainty, whether it&#8217;s over invitations that never came or a friend&#8217;s agonizing infertility. In &#8220;No,&#8221; she admires her mother&#8217;s ability to set boundaries and her liberating willingness to be unpopular. In &#8220;Tell Me More,&#8221; a facialist named Tish teaches her something important about listening. And in &#8220;I Was Wrong,&#8221; she comes clean about her disastrous role in a family fight&#8211;and explains why saying sorry may not be enough. With refreshing candor, a deep well of empathy, and her signature desire to understand &#8220;the thing behind the thing,&#8221; Corrigan swings between meditations on life with a preoccupied husband and two mercurial teenage daughters to profound observations on love and loss.  With the streetwise, ever-relatable voice that defines Corrigan&#8217;s work, Tell Me More is a moving and meaningful take on the power of the right words at the right moment to change everything. Praise for Tell Me More  &#8220;It is such a comfort just knowing that Kelly Corrigan exists: she is somehow both wise and self-deprecating; funny but unafraid of pain; frank but gentle. She is the sister/mother/best friend we all wish we could have&#8211;and because of this big-hearted book, we all get to.&#8221;&#8211;Ariel Levy, author of The Rules Do Not Apply  &#8220;With full-bodied humor and radical sensitivity, Kelly Corrigan transforms the mundane pain of life into a necessary spiritual text of sorts, one that reminds us that we have the right to grieve but the obligation to be grateful. This book will remind you that you are human&#8211;and of the fragile loveliness of being so.&#8221;&#8211;Lena Dunham</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The founder and director of the Thirty Million Words Initiative, Professor Dana Suskind, explains why the most important&#8211;and astoundingly simple&#8211;thing you can do for your child&#8217;s future success in life is to to talk to them.     </p>
<p>                    What nurtures the brain to optimum intelligence and stability?     </p>
<p>                    It is a secret hiding in plain sight: the most important thing we can do for our children is to have conversations with them. The way you talk with your growing child literally builds his or her brain. Parent talk can drastically improve school readiness and lifelong learning in everything from math to art. Indeed, parent-child talk is a fundamental, critical factor in building grit, self-control, leadership skills, and generosity. It is crucial to making the most in life of the luck you have with your genes.     </p>
<p>                    This landmark account of a new scientific perspective describes what works and what doesn&#8217;t (baby talk is fine; relentless correction isn&#8217;t). Discover how to create the best language environments for children by following the simple structure of the Three Ts: Tune In; Talk More; Take Turns. Dr. Suskind and her colleagues around the country have worked with thousands of families; now their insights and successful, measured approaches are available to all.     </p>
<p>                    This is the first book to reveal how and why the first step in nurturing successful lives is talking to children in ways that build their brains. Your family&#8211;and our nation&#8211;need to know.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Godmother of Silicon Valley, legendary teacher, and mother of a Super Family shares her tried-and-tested methods for raising happy, healthy, successful children using Trust, Respect, Independence, Collaboration, and Kindness: TRICK.    </p>
<p>                    Esther Wojcicki&#8211;&#8220;Woj&#8221; to her many friends and admirers&#8211;is famous for three things: teaching a high school class that has changed the lives of thousands of kids, inspiring Silicon Valley legends like Steve Jobs, and raising three daughters who have each become famously successful. What do these three accomplishments have in common? They&#8217;re the result of TRICK, Woj&#8217;s secret to raising successful people: Trust, Respect, Independence, Collaboration, and Kindness.     </p>
<p>                    Simple lessons, but the results are radical. Wojcicki&#8217;s methods are the opposite of helicopter parenting. As we face an epidemic of parental anxiety, Woj is here to say: relax. Talk to infants as if they are adults. Allow teenagers to pick projects that relate to the real world and their own passions, and let them figure out how to complete them. Above all, let your child lead. How to Raise Successful People offers essential lessons for raising, educating, and managing people to their highest potential. Change your parenting, change the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unconventional&#8211;yet effective&#8211;parenting strategies, carefully curated by the creator of the popular podcast The Longest Shortest Time     </p>
<p>                    Some of the best parenting advice that Hillary Frank ever received did not come from parenting experts, but from friends and podcast listeners who acted on a whim, often in moments of desperation. These weird parenting wins were born of moments when the expert advice wasn&#8217;t working, and instead of freaking out, these parents had a stroke of genius. For example, there&#8217;s the dad who pig-snorted in his baby&#8217;s ear to get her to stop crying, and the mom who made a flat daddy out of cardboard and sat it at the dinner table when her kids were missing their deployed military father.<br />
                     Every parent and kid is unique, and as we get to know our kids, we can figure out what makes them tick. Because this is an ongoing process, Weird Parenting Wins covers children of all ages, ranging in topics from The Art of Getting Your Kid to Act Like a Person (on hygiene, potty training, and manners) to The Art of Getting Your Kid to Tell You Things (because eventually, they&#8217;re going to be tight-lipped). You may find that someone else&#8217;s weird parenting win works for you, or you might be inspired to try something new the next time you&#8217;re stuck in a parenting rut. Or maybe you&#8217;ll just get a good laugh out of the mom who got her kid to try beets because&#8230;it might turn her poop pink.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One morning, Kim Brooks made a split-second decision to leave her four-year-old son in the car while she ran into a store. What happened would consume the next several years of her life and spur her to investigate the broader role our current culture of fear plays in parenthood.<br />
                    In Small Animals, Brooks asks, of all the emotions inherent in parenting, is there any more universal or profound than fear? Why have our notions of what it means to be a good parent changed so radically? In what ways do these changes impact the lives of parents, children, and the structure of society at large? And what, in the end, does the rise of fearful parenting tell us about ourselves?<br />
                    Fuelled by urgency and the emotional intensity of Brooks’s own story, Small Animals is a riveting examination of the ways our culture of competitive, anxious, and judgmental parenting has profoundly altered the experiences of parents and children. In her signature style – by turns funny, penetrating, and always illuminating – which has dazzled millions of fans and been called ‘striking’ by New York Times Book Review and ‘beautiful’ by the National Book Critics Circle, Brooks offers a provocative, compelling portrait of parenthood and calls us to examine what we most value in our relationships with our children and one another.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Christakis . . . expertly weaves academic research, personal experience and anecdotal evidence into her book . . . a bracing and convincing case that early education has reached a point of crisis . . . her book is a rare thing: a serious work of research that also happens to be well-written and personal . . . engaging and important.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8211;Washington Post     </p>
<p>                    What kids need from grown-ups (but aren&#8217;t getting)&#8230;an impassioned plea for educators and parents to put down the worksheets and flash cards, ditch the tired craft projects (yes, you, Thanksgiving Handprint Turkey) and exotic vocabulary lessons, and double-down on one, simple word: play.<br />
                    &#8211;NPR     </p>
<p>                    The New York Times bestseller that provides a bold challenge to the conventional wisdom about early childhood, with a pragmatic program to encourage parents and teachers to rethink how and where young children learn best by taking the child&#8217;s eye view of the learning environment     </p>
<p>                     To a four-year-old watching bulldozers at a construction site or chasing butterflies in flight, the world is awash with promise. Little children come into the world hardwired to learn in virtually any setting and about any matter. Yet in today&#8217;s preschool and kindergarten classrooms, learning has been reduced to scripted lessons and suspect metrics that too often undervalue a child&#8217;s intelligence while overtaxing the child&#8217;s growing brain. These mismatched expectations wreak havoc on the family: parents fear that if they choose the &#8220;wrong&#8221; program, their child won&#8217;t get into the &#8220;right&#8221; college. But Yale early childhood expert Erika Christakis says our fears are wildly misplaced. Our anxiety about preparing and safeguarding our children&#8217;s future seems to have reached a fever pitch at a time when, ironically, science gives us more certainty than ever before that young children are exceptionally strong thinkers.<br />
                     In her pathbreaking book, Christakis explains what it&#8217;s like to be a young child in America today, in a world designed by and for adults, where we have confused schooling with learning. She offers real-life solutions to real-life issues, with nuance and direction that takes us far beyond the usual prescriptions for fewer tests, more play. She looks at children&#8217;s use of language, their artistic expressions, the way their imaginations grow, and how they build deep emotional bonds to stretch the boundaries of their small worlds. Rather than clutter their worlds with more and more stuff, sometimes the wisest course for us is to learn how to get out of their way.<br />
                     Christakis&#8217;s message is energizing and reassuring: young children are inherently powerful, and they (and their parents) will flourish when we learn new ways of restoring the vital early learning environment to one that is best suited to the littlest learners. This bold and pragmatic challenge to the conventional wisdom peels back the mystery of childhood, revealing a place that&#8217;s rich with possibility.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the most important books of our modern era&#8221; -Amb. Jaime de Bourbon    </p>
<p>                    For anyone struggling with conflict, this book can transform you. Negotiating the Nonnegotiable takes you on a journey into the heart and soul of conflict, providing unique insight into the emotional undercurrents that too often sweep us out to sea. With vivid stories of his closed-door sessions with warring political groups, disputing businesspeople, and families in crisis, Daniel Shapiro presents a universally applicable method to successfully navigate conflict.  A deep, provocative book to reflect on and wrestle with, this book can change your life.    </p>
<p>                     Be warned: This book is not a quick fix. Real change takes work. You will learn how to master five emotional dynamics that can sabotage conflict outside your awareness:    </p>
<p>                    1. Vertigo: How can you avoid      getting emotionally consumed in conflict?<br />
                    2. Repetition compulsion: How can you stop      repeating the same conflicts again and again?<br />
                    3. Taboos: How can you discuss      sensitive issues at the heart of the conflict?<br />
                    4. Assault on the sacred: What should you do if      your values feel threatened?<br />
                    5. Identity politics: What can you do if      others use politics against you?     </p>
<p>                    In our era of discontent, this is just the book we need to resolve conflict in our own lives and in the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though anxiety has risen among young people overall, recent research studies confirm that it has skyrocketed in girls since the turn of the century. So what&#8217;s to blame? And how can we help these girls?    </p>
<p>                    In the same engaging, anecdotal style and reassuring tone that won over thousands of readers of her first book, Untangled, clinical psychologist Lisa Damour starts by examining the science of stress and anxiety, then turns to the many facets of girls&#8217; lives where stress hits them hard: the parental expectations they face at home, pressures at school, social anxiety among their peers, and on social media. Exploring the multiple layers of girls&#8217; lives, Damour shows us the critical steps we can take to shield them from the toxic stress to which both our culture and also we, as their caregivers, subject them.    </p>
<p>                    Readers familiar with Damour from Untangled or from her New York Times journalism will be drawn to this important new contribution to understanding and supporting today&#8217;s girls &#8211; and tomorrow&#8217;s young women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;True belonging doesn&#8217;t require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are.&#8217;  Social scientist Brene Brown, PhD, LMSW has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives &#8211; experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarisation. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping out a clear path to true belonging.    </p>
<p>                    Brown argues that what we&#8217;re experiencing today is a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, &#8216;True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in both being a part of something, and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that&#8217;s rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it&#8217;s easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it&#8217;s a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It&#8217;s a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.&#8217; Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, &#8216;The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it&#8217;s the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why didn&#8217;t he call you back? Why doesn&#8217;t he talk to your friends? Why does he keep putting off your dates? This book has the answers. Now the international bestseller is re-released to change the lives of a new generation.    </p>
<p>                              This is a hilarious, playful, honest explanation of male behaviour from a writer and a consultant of Sex and the City. Stop wasting your time chasing after men who aren&#8217;t into you, and find men who are! Greg Behrendt provides the insight you need to move on and find them.    </p>
<p>                              The idea behind &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; came from a conversation between Greg Behrendt and his fellow (female) SATC writers, when they asked his advice one day. This conversation became the seed of an episode which struck a powerful chord with viewers. Before long, Greg became aware that this simple phrase had the power to change women&#8217;s lives.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; is now a worldwide phenomenon. Over 100k copies have been sold across all editions, it has topped bestseller charts internationally, and has been made into a major Hollywood film. Now repackaged for a new generation with an eyecatching new cover, He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You is essential armour for the modern woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading clinical psychologist Lisa Damour identifies the seven key phases marking the journey from girlhood to womanhood, and offers practical advice for those raising teenage girls.    </p>
<p>                    We expect an enormous amount from our teenage girls in a world where they are bombarded with messages about how they should look, behave, succeed. Yet we also speak as though adolescence is a nightmare rollercoaster ride for both parent and child, to be endured rather than enjoyed.     </p>
<p>                    In Untangled, world authority and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour provides an accessible, detailed, comprehensive guide to parenting teenage girls. She believes there is a predictable blueprint for how girls grow; seven easily recognisable &#8216;strands&#8217; of transition from childhood through adolescence and on to adulthood. Girls naturally develop at different rates, typically on more than one front, and the transition will be unique to every girl.     </p>
<p>                    Each chapter describes a phase, such as &#8216;contending with adult authority&#8217; and &#8216;entering the romantic world&#8217;, with hints and tips for parents and daughters, and a &#8216;when to worry&#8217; section. Damour writes sympathetically and clearly, providing a practical and helpful guide for any parent, and for teenage girls too.</p>

<p>                     Over the last few decades, Americans have turned college admissions into a terrifying and occasionally devastating process, preceded by test prep, tutors, all sorts of stratagems, all kinds of rankings, and a conviction among too many young people that their futures will be determined and their worth established by which schools say yes and which say no.     </p>
<p>                     In Where You Go is Not Who You&#8217;ll Be, Frank Bruni explains why this mindset is wrong, giving students and their parents a new perspective on this brutal, deeply flawed competition and a path out of the anxiety that it provokes.     </p>
<p>                     Bruni, a bestselling author and a columnist for the New York Times, shows that the Ivy League has no monopoly on corner offices, governors&#8217; mansions, or the most prestigious academic and scientific grants. Through statistics, surveys, and the stories of hugely successful people, he demonstrates that many kinds of colleges serve as ideal springboards. And he illuminates how to make the most of them. What matters in the end are students&#8217; efforts in and out of the classroom, not the name on their diploma.     </p>
<p>                     Where you go isn&#8217;t who you&#8217;ll be. Americans need to hear that&#8211;and this indispensable manifesto says it with eloquence and respect for the real promise of higher education.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Common-the Grammy Award, Academy Award, and Golden Globe-winning musician, actor, and activist-follows up his New York Times bestselling memoir One Day It&#8217;ll All Make Sense with this inspiring exploration of how love and mindfulness can build communities and allow you to take better control of your life through actions and words.    </p>
<p>                    Common believes that the phrase &#8220;let love have the last word&#8221; is not just a declaration; it is a statement of purpose, a daily promise. Love is the most powerful force on the planet and ultimately, the way you love determines who you are and how you experience life.    </p>
<p>                    Touching on God, self-love, partners, children, family, and community, Common explores the core tenets of love to help others understand what it means to receive and, most important, to give love. He moves from the personal-writing about his daughter, to whom he wants to be a better father-to the universal, where he observes that our society has become fractured under issues of race and politics. He knows there&#8217;s no quick remedy for all of the hurt in the world, but love-for yourself and for others-is where the healing begins.    </p>
<p>                    Courageous, insightful, brave, and characteristically authentic, Let Love Have the Last Word shares Common&#8217;s own unique and personal stories of the people and experiences that have led to a greater understanding of love and all it has to offer. It is a powerful call to action for a new generation of open hearts and minds, one that is sure to resonate for years to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A hands-on, real talk guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with&#8221; &#8211; Reese Witherspoon    </p>
<p>                    Do you find yourself taking on the lion&#8217;s share of all the thankless, invisible but time-consuming work in the home? FAIR PLAY is the first book that shows you that there can be a different way: a way to get more done, with less fuss, in a way that feels more balanced.    </p>
<p>                    Eve Rodsky is changing society one relationship at a time, by coming up with a 21st-century solution to an age-old problem: women shouldering the brunt of domestic responsibilities, the mental load, the emotional labour. Everything that is required to keep the fridge full, the children&#8217;s homework in their bags, and the household running. The unequal division of all this invisible work in relationships is a recipe for disaster, but no one has offered a real solution to this dilemma, until now.     </p>
<p>                    Eve Rodsky was tired of always being the one who has to remember to buy loo roll, or to book the family&#8217;s dentist appointments, or to send the thank you cards &#8211; all while working full time. So Eve decided to do what she does every day as an organisational management consultant: Organise. She conducted original research with more than 500 couples to figure out WHAT the invisible work in a family actually is and HOW to get it done effectively and all in a way that makes relationships even stronger. FAIR PLAY identifies the 100 main tasks in any relationship, and then divides those tasks fairly (not necessarily equally) so that both parties contribute their fair share.     </p>
<p>                    If we don&#8217;t learn to rebalance our home life and reclaim some time to develop the skills and passions that keep us unique, then we risk losing our right to be interesting, not just to our partner, but to ourselves. Getting this right isn&#8217;t a luxury, it&#8217;s a necessity for a happy, lasting partnership. Part how-to guide for couples, part modern relationship manifesto, FAIR PLAY offers an innovative system with a completely original lexicon to discuss how relationships actually work &#8230; and how we can make them work better.</p>

<p>                    Inspired by the spirit of Henry David Thoreau-&#8220;All good things are wild and free&#8221;-mother of five Ainsley Arment founded Wild + Free. This growing online community of mothers and families want their children to receive a quality education at home by challenging their intellectual abilities and nurturing their sense of curiosity, joy and awe-the essence of a positive childhood.     </p>
<p>                    The homeschool approach of past generations is gone-including the stigma of socially awkward kids, conservative clothes, and a classroom setting replicated in the home. The Wild + Free movement is focused on a love of nature, reading great books, pursuing interests and hobbies, making the entire world a classroom, and prolonging the wonder of childhood, an appealing philosophy that is unpacked in the pages of this book    </p>
<p>                    The Call of the Wild and Free offers advice, information, and positive encouragement for parents considering homeschooling, those currently in the trenches looking for inspiration, as well as parents, educators, and caregivers who want supplementary resources to enhance their kids&#8217; traditional educations.</p>

<p>                    Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother is a story about a mother, two daughters, and two dogs. It was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones. But instead, it&#8217;s about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how you can be humbled by a thirteen-year-old.    </p>
<p>                    Witty, entertaining and provocative, this is a unique and important book that will transform your perspective of parenting forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Across a decade as Stanford University&#8217;s dean of freshmen, Julie Lythcott-Haims noticed a startling rise in parental involvement in students&#8217; lives. Every year, more parents were exerting control over students&#8217; academic work, extracurricular, and career choices, taking matters into their own hands rather than risk their child&#8217;s failure or disappointment. Meanwhile, Lythcott-Haims encountered increasing numbers of students who, as a result of hyper attentive parenting, lacked a strong sense of self and were poorly equipped to handle the demands of adult life. In How to Raise an Adult, Lythcott-Haims draws on research, on conversations with admissions officers, educators, and employers, and on her own insights as a mother and as a student clean to highlight the ways in which over parenting harms children and their stressed-out parents, and our society at large. While empathising with the parental hopes and, especially, fears that lead to over helping, Lythcott-Haims offers practical alternative strategies that underline the importance of allowing children to make their own mistakes and develop the resilience, resourcefulness, and inner determination necessary for success.<br />
                    Relevant to parents of toddlers as well as of twenty something&#8217;s and of special value to parents of teens &#8211; this book is a rallying cry for those who wish to ensure that the next generation can take charge of their own lives with competence and confidence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The word &#8220;love&#8221; is most often defined as a noun, yet&#8230;we would all love better if we used it as a verb,&#8221; writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.  As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question &#8220;What is love?&#8221; her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society&#8217;s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the &#8220;100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.&#8221; All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.</p>

<p>                    Do you ever suspect that everyone else has life figured out and you don&#8217;t have a clue? If so, Rachel Hollis has something to tell you: that&#8217;s a lie.    </p>
<p>                    If you have ever said any of these things to yourself . . .    </p>
<p>                    Something else will make me happy.<br />
                    I&#8217;m not a good mom.<br />
                    I will never get past this.<br />
                    I am defined by my weight.<br />
                    I should be further along by now.    </p>
<p>                    . . . then you could benefit from the unflinching faith and rock-hard tenacity Rachel Hollis has in store for you. In this challenging but conversational book, Rachel exposes the twenty lies and misconceptions that too often hold us back from living joyfully and productively, lies we&#8217;ve told ourselves so often we don&#8217;t even hear them anymore.    </p>
<p>                    Rachel is real and talks about real issues. More than that, she reveals the specific practical strategies that helped her move past them. In the process, she encourages, entertains, and even kicks a little butt, all to convince you to do whatever it takes to get real and become the joyous, confident woman you were meant to be. Because you really can live with passion and hustle &#8211; and give yourself grace without giving up.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whether selling, managing, applying to university, looking for a job &#8211; or looking for a soulmate &#8211; the secret of success is connecting with other people. Nicholas Boothman shows exactly how to make the best out of any relationship&#8217;s most critical moment &#8211; those first 90 seconds that make up a first impression. Armed with his program, readers learn how to establish immediate trust by synchronizing voice tone and body language; the power of a Really Useful Attitude; and how to get people talking and keep them talking. He discusses eye cues, the magic of opposites attracting, and sensory preferences &#8211; some of us are Visual people, others are Kinesthetic (responding most to the sense of touch), and a few are Auditory. So when you say &#8220;I see what you mean&#8221; to a Visual, you&#8217;re really speaking his or her language.</p>

<p>                    What is love? Sharon Salzberg believes that love is a powerful healing force for us all, and that modern associations with romance and adoration are limiting. By redefining love, she helps us to recognize our desire for happiness and enhance our connections with each other.     </p>
<p>                    Real Love is a creative toolkit of mindfulness exercises and meditation techniques that can help you to truly engage with your present experience and create deeper love relationships &#8211; with yourself, your partner, friends and family, and with life itself. The book encourages us to strip away layers of negative habits and obstacles and to improve deeper connections, helping us to experience authentic love based on direct experience, rather than preconceptions.</p>

<p>                                &#8216;We are raising our boys to be brave, but our girls to be perfect. And this is holding us back.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                              Imagine if you lived without the fear of failure, without the fear of not measuring up. If you no longer felt the need to stifle your thoughts and swallow what you really want to say in order to please and appease others. If you could stop berating yourself mercilessly for human mistakes, let go of the guilt and the strangling pressure to be perfect, and just breathe. What if, in every decision you faced, you made the brave choice or took the bolder path. Would you be happier? Would you impact the world in the ways you dream you can?    </p>
<p>                                I believe the answer to both is yes.</p>

<p>                    If you really loved me&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    After all I&#8217;ve done for you&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    How can you be so selfish&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Do any of the above sound familiar? They&#8217;re all examples of emotional blackmail, a powerful form of manipulation in which people close to us threaten to punish us for not doing what they want. Emotional blackmailers know how much we value our relationships with them. They know our vulnerabilities and our deepest secrets. They are our mothers, our partners, our bosses and coworkers, our friends and our lovers. And no matter how much they care about us, they use this intimate knowledge to give themselves the payoff they want: our compliance.    </p>
<p>                    Susan Forward knows what pushes our hot buttons. Just as John Gray illuminates the communications gap between the sexes in Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus,  and Harriet Lerner describes an intricate dynamic in The Dance of Anger,  so Susan Forward presents the anatomy of a relationship damaged by manipulation, and gives readers an arsenal of tools to fight back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The struggle to understand the infant-parent bond ranks as one of the great quests of modern psychology, one that touches us deeply because it holds so many clues to how we become who we are. How are our personalities formed? How do our early struggles with our parents reappear in the way we relate to others as adults? Why do we repeat with our own children&#8211;seemingly against our will&#8211;the very behaviors we most disliked about our parents? In Becoming Attached, psychologist and noted journalist Robert Karen offers fresh insight into some of the most fundamental and fascinating questions of emotional life.<br />
                     Karen begins by tracing the history of attachment theory through the controversial work of John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst, and Mary Ainsworth, an American developmental psychologist, who together launched a revolution in child psychology. Karen tells about their personal and professional struggles, their groundbreaking discoveries, and the recent flowering of attachment theory research in universities all over the world, making it one of the century&#8217;s most enduring ideas in developmental psychology.<br />
                     In a world of working parents and makeshift day care, the need to assess the impact of parenting styles and the bond between child and caregiver is more urgent than ever. Karen addresses such issues as: What do children need to feel that the world is a positive place and that they have value? Is day care harmful for children under one year? What experiences in infancy will enable a person to develop healthy relationships as an adult?, and he demonstrates how different approaches to mothering are associated with specific infant behaviors, such as clinginess, avoidance, or secure exploration. He shows how these patterns become ingrained and how they reveal themselves at age two, in the preschool years, in middle childhood, and in adulthood. And, with thought-provoking insights, he gives us a new understanding of how negative patterns and insecure attachment can be changed and resolved throughout a person&#8217;s life.<br />
                     The infant is in many ways a great mystery to us. Every one of us has been one; many of us have lived with or raised them. Becoming Attached is not just a voyage of discovery in child emotional development and its pertinence to adult life but a voyage of personal discovery as well, for it is impossible to read this book without reflecting on one&#8217;s own life as a child, a parent, and an intimate partner in love or marriage.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Blows your mind on every page&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Should be mandatory reading for anyone who cares about the next generation&#8217; Lori Gottlieb, New York Times bestselling author of Maybe You Should Talk to Someone    </p>
<p>                    Peggy Orenstein broke ground with her bestselling Girls &#038; Sex, exploring young women&#8217;s right to pleasure and agency in sexual encounters. Now she turns her focus to boys with an examination of how young men are navigating sexual culture in these changing times &#8211; and what we need to do to help them.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on comprehensive interviews with young  men, psychologists and experts in the field, Boys &#038; Sex dissects &#8216;locker room talk&#8217;; pornography as the new sex education; the role of empathy; boys&#8217; understanding of hookup culture and consent; and their experience as both perpetrators and victims of sexual assault.    </p>
<p>                    By presenting young men&#8217;s experience in all its complexity, Orenstein unravels the hidden truths, hard lessons and important realities of young male sexuality in today&#8217;s world. The result is a provocative and paradigm-shifting work that offers a much-needed vision of how boys can truly move forward as better men.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER &#8211; OVER 1.5 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A deeply compassionate guide to self-care &#8211; simple and profound&#8217; Sir Kenneth Branagh    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you want to free yourself from anxiety and stress, and feel truly at ease with yourself, then read this book&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Authoritative, beautifully written and much-loved by its readers, Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world has become a word-of-mouth bestseller and global phenomenon. It reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that you can incorporate into daily life to break the cycle of anxiety, stress unhappiness and exhaustion. It promotes the kind of happiness that gets into your bones and allows you to meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.     </p>
<p>                    Mindfulness is based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Co-developed by Professor Mark Williams of Oxford University, MBCT is recommended by the UK&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is as effective as drugs for preventing depression. But, equally, it works for the rest of us who aren&#8217;t depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the relentless demands of the modern world.     </p>
<p>                    By investing just a few minutes each day, this classic guide to mindfulness will put you back in control of your life once again.</p>

<p>                    Combining insights from psychology, sociology, anthropology, primatology, and evolutionary biology, she explains how and why the tendency of children to take cues from their peers works to their evolutionary advantage. This electrifying book explodes many of our unquestioned beliefs about children and parents and gives us a radically new view of childhood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This third edition of an international bestseller&#8211;over 2 million copies sold worldwide and translated into 33 languages&#8211;details how its powerful insights on motivation, conflict, and collaboration can benefit organizations as well as individuals.     </p>
<p>                    Since its original publication in 2000, Leadership and Self-Deception has become an international word-of-mouth phenomenon. Rather than tapering off, it sells more copies every year. The book&#8217;s central insight&#8211;that the key to leadership lies not in what we do but in who we are&#8211;has proven to have powerful implications not only for organizational leadership but in readers&#8217; personal lives as well.     </p>
<p>                    Leadership and Self-Deception uses an entertaining story everyone can relate to about a man facing challenges at work and at home to expose the fascinating ways that we blind ourselves to our true motivations and unwittingly sabotage the effectiveness of our own efforts to achieve happiness and increase happiness. We trap ourselves in a box of endless self-justification. Most importantly, the book shows us the way out. Readers will discover what millions already have learned&#8211;how to consistently tap into and act on their innate sense of what&#8217;s right, dramatically improving all of their relationships.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing from Buddhist and yogic precepts, this practical guide offers tools for becoming a better, more compassionate communicator at home, at work, and in the world     </p>
<p>                     Have you ever tried to tell someone what you want only to feel misunderstood and frustrated? Or hesitated to ask for what you needed because you didn&#8217;t want to burden the other person? Or been stuck in blame or anger that wouldn&#8217;t go away?     </p>
<p>                     Judith and Ike Lasater, long-term students of yoga and Buddhism, experienced dilemmas like these, too. Even though they had studied the yoga principle of satya (truth) and the Buddhist precept of right speech, it was not until they began practicing Marshall Rosenberg&#8217;s techniques of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) that they understood how to live satya and right speech.     </p>
<p>                     In What We Say Matters, Judith and Ike describe their journey through NVC and how speech becomes a spiritual practice based on giving and receiving with compassion&#8211;everywhere, all the time&#8211;whether at home, at work, or in the world. Their writing is deeply personal, punctuated by their recounts of trial and error, success and failure, laughter and challenge&#8211;even in writing this book! They guide you through an introduction to NVC with clear explanations, poignant examples, suggested exercises, and helpful resources. With practice, you&#8217;ll learn new ways to:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Extend empathy to yourself and others<br />
                    &#8211; Distinguish between feelings and needs<br />
                    &#8211; Make requests rather than demands<br />
                    &#8211; Choose connection over conflict<br />
                    &#8211; Create mutually satisfying outcomes</p>

<p>                    Doctors John and Julie Gottman have spent over three decades studying the habits of 3000 couples. Within 10 minutes of meeting a couple, they can predict who will stay happily together or who will split up, with 94% accuracy. Based on their findings on the ingredients to a happy, lasting love life, they have now created an easy series of eight dates, spanning:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; commitment &#038; trust<br />
                    &#8211; conflict resolution<br />
                    &#8211; intimacy &#038; sex<br />

                    &#8211; goals &#038; aspirations    </p>
<p>                    Eight Dates draws on rigorous scientific and psychological research about how we fall in love using case studies of real-life couples whose relationships have improved after committing time to each other and following the dates. Full of innovative exercises and conversation starters to explore ways to deepen each aspect of the relationship, Eight Dates is an essential resource that makes a relationship fulfilling.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever think you&#8217;re the only one making any sense? Or tried to reason with your partner with disastrous results? Do long, rambling answers drive you crazy? Or does your colleague&#8217;s abrasive manner get your back up?     </p>
<p>                    You are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was &#8216;surrounded by idiots&#8217;, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people.    </p>
<p>                    Originally published in Swedish in 2014 as Omgiven Av Idioter, Erikson&#8217;s Surrounded by Idiots is already an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide, of which over 750,000 copies have been sold in Sweden alone. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with &#8211; in and out of the office &#8211;  based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way(s) we speak and share information.     </p>
<p>                    Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication and advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or indeed shut up. Packed with &#8216;aha!&#8217; and &#8216;oh no!&#8217; moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and influence those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.     </p>
<p>                    And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn&#8217;t you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the parenting information out there and the constant pressure to be the &#8220;perfect&#8221; parent, it seems as if many parents have lost track of one very important piece of the parenting puzzle: raising happy kids.     </p>
<p>                     Parenting today has gotten far too complicated. It&#8217;s never been the easiest job in the world, but with all the &#8220;parenting advice&#8221; parents are met with at every corner, it&#8217;s hard not to become bewildered. It seems that in the past it was a good deal simpler. You made sure there was dinner on the table and the kids got to school on time and no one set anything on fire, and you called it a success. But today everybody has a different method for dealing with the madness&#8211;attachment parenting, free-range parenting, mindful parenting. And who is to say one is more right or better than another? How do you choose?     </p>
<p>                     The truth is that whatever drumbeat you march to, all parents would agree that we just want our kids to be happy. It seems like a no-brainer, right? But in the face of all the many parenting theories out there, happiness feels like it has become incidental. That&#8217;s where The Happy Kid Handbook by child and adolescent psychotherapist and parenting expert Katie Hurley comes in. She shows parents how happiness is the key to raising confident, capable children. It&#8217;s not about giving in every time your child wants something so they won&#8217;t feel bad when you say no, or making sure that they&#8217;re taking that art class, and the ballet class, and the soccer class (to help with their creativity and their coordination and all that excess energy). Happiness is about parenting the individual, because not every child is the same, and not every child will respond to parenting the same way. By exploring the differences among introverts, extroverts, and everything in between, this definitive guide to parenting offers parents the specific strategies they need to meet their child exactly where he or she needs to be met from a social-emotional perspective. A back-to-basics guide to parenting, The Happy Kid Handbook is a must-have for any parent hoping to be the best parent they can be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It con­verts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes skeptics and cynics into believers and the undecided into the loyal.    </p>
<p>                    Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it&#8217;s more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.    </p>
<p>                    Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the beloved and wildly popular host of the PBS Kids show Dinosaur Train, here is the book every parent needs: a rousing call to connect our kids to the natural world, filled with tips and advice.    </p>
<p>                    The average North American child now spends about seven hours a day staring at screens and mere minutes engaged in unstructured play outdoors. Yet recent research indicates that experiences in nature are essential for healthy growth.     </p>
<p>                    Regular exposure to nature can help relieve stress, depression, and attention deficits. It can reduce bullying, combat obesity, and boost academic scores. Most critical of all, abundant time in natural settings seems to yield long-term benefits in kids&#8217; cognitive, emotional, and social development.     </p>
<p>                    How to Raise a Wild Child is a timely and engaging antidote, offering teachers, parents, and other caregivers the necessary tools to engender a meaningful, lasting connection between children and the natural world.     </p>
<p>                    Distilling the latest research in multiple disciplines, Sampson reveals how adults can help kids fall in love with nature&#8211;enlisting technology as an ally, taking advantage of urban nature, and instilling a sense of place along the way.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;In a time when the connection between humans and the rest of nature is most vulnerable, Scott offers parents and teachers a book of encouragement and knowledge, and to children, the priceless gift of wonder.&#8221;&#8211;Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods and The Nature Principle</p>

<p>                    &#8220;Gripping&#8230;how can teachers snatch back their critical role and give children the necessary space to fail? They could start by making parents read Lahey.&#8221; &#8212; New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Paul Tough&#8217;s How Children Succeed and Wendy Mogel&#8217;s The Blessing of a Skinned Knee, this groundbreaking manifesto focuses on the critical school years when parents must learn to allow their children to experience the disappointment and frustration that occur from life&#8217;s inevitable problems so that they can grow up to be successful, resilient, and self-reliant adults.    </p>
<p>                    Modern parenting is defined by an unprecedented level of overprotectiveness: parents who rush to school at the whim of a phone call to deliver forgotten assignments, who challenge teachers on report card disappointments, mastermind children&#8217;s friendships, and interfere on the playing field. As teacher and writer Jessica Lahey explains, even though these parents see themselves as being highly responsive to their children&#8217;s well being, they aren&#8217;t giving them the chance to experience failure&#8211;or the opportunity to learn to solve their own problems.    </p>
<p>                    Overparenting has the potential to ruin a child&#8217;s confidence and undermine their education, Lahey reminds us. Teachers don&#8217;t just teach reading, writing, and arithmetic. They teach responsibility, organization, manners, restraint, and foresight&#8211;important life skills children carry with them long after they leave the classroom.    </p>
<p>                    Providing a path toward solutions, Lahey lays out a blueprint with targeted advice for handling homework, report cards, social dynamics, and sports. Most importantly, she sets forth a plan to help parents learn to step back and embrace their children&#8217;s failures. Hard-hitting yet warm and wise, The Gift of Failure is essential reading for parents, educators, and psychologists nationwide who want to help children succeed.</p>
