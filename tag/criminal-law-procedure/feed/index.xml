										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the town of Ada, Oklahoma, Ron Williamson was going to be the next Mickey Mantle. But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from Ron&#8217;s home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death&#8211;in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a man&#8217;s already broken life&#8230;and let a true killer go free. Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John Grisham&#8217;s first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocence&#8211;a book no American can afford to miss.    </p>

                    Winner of the Books are My Bag Non-Fiction Award.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Waterstones Book of the Year.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Specsavers Non-Fiction Book of the Year.</p>
<p>                    You may not wish to think about it, but one day you or someone you love will almost certainly appear in a criminal courtroom. You might be a juror, a victim, a witness or &#8211; perhaps through no fault of your own &#8211; a defendant. Whatever your role, you&#8217;d expect a fair trial.</p>
<p>                      I&#8217;m a barrister. I work in the criminal justice system, and every day I see how fairness is not guaranteed. Too often the system fails those it is meant to protect. The innocent are wronged and the guilty allowed to walk free.</p>
<p>                    In The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It&#8217;s Broken I want to share some stories from my daily life to show you how the system is broken, who broke it and why we should start caring before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times top ten bestseller for twenty-four weeks.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; The inspiration for American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson on FX, starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., John Travolta, David Schwimmer, and Connie Britton     </p>
<p>                     The definitive account of the O. J. Simpson trial, The Run of His Life is a prodigious feat of reporting that could have been written only by the foremost legal journalist of our time. First published less than a year after the infamous verdict, Jeffrey Toobin&#8217;s nonfiction masterpiece tells the whole story, from the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman to the ruthless gamesmanship behind the scenes of &#8220;the trial of the century.&#8221; Rich in character, as propulsive as a legal thriller, this enduring narrative continues to shock and fascinate with its candid depiction of the human drama that upended American life.    </p>
<p>                     Praise for The Run of His Life    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;This is the book to read.&#8221;&#8211;Michiko Kakutani, The New York Times      </p>
<p>                     &#8220;This book stands out as a gripping and colorful account of the crime and trial that captured the world&#8217;s attention.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Sunday Globe    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;A real page-turner . . . strips away the months of circuslike televised proceedings and the sordid tell-all books and lays out a simple, but devastating, synopsis of the case.&#8221;&#8211;Entertainment Weekly    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;A well-written, profoundly rational analysis of the trial and, more specifically, the lawyers who conducted it.&#8221;&#8211;USA Today     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Engrossing . . . Toobin&#8217;s insight into the motives and mind-set of key players sets this Simpson book apart from the pack.&#8221;&#8211;People (one of the top ten books of the year)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;Unfair succinctly and persuasively recounts cutting-edge research testifying to the faulty and inaccurate procedures that underpin virtually all aspects of our criminal justice system, illustrating many with case studies.&#8221;&#8211;The Boston Globe    </p>
<p>                     A child is gunned down by a police officer; an investigator ignores critical clues in a case; an innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit; a jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken.     </p>
<p>                     But it&#8217;s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.     </p>
<p>                     This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant&#8217;s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In Unfair, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.     </p>
<p>                     Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases&#8211;from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case&#8211;Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society&#8217;s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system&#8217;s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.</p>
