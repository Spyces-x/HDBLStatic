										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Celebrated actor, personality, and all-around nerd Wil Wheaton updates his memoir of collected blog posts with all new material and annotations as he reexamines one of the most interesting lives in Hollywood and fandom!<br />
                              Wil Wheaton grew up.    </p>
<p>                              Ideally, this is what everyone does. But most of us don&#8217;t do it in front of millions of people. Wil was a very famous kid &#8211; right up until he wasn&#8217;t. After that, he wasn&#8217;t sure who he was at all.    </p>
<p>                              So, in 2001, he started a blog. It was less about being a famous child than about being a not-so-famous grownup. He wrote about his pets and his hobbies, punk rock and parenting, board games and birthdays and (most importantly) burritos.    </p>
<p>                              He thought he was writing for an audience of one: himself. To be fair, he was only off by about 3 million people. In Still Just a Geek, an older, somewhat wiser Wil revisits Just a Geek, his 2004 collection of posts from that blog, with all-new reflections on nerd culture, fame, love, trauma, tragedy, and confronting the worst parts of yourself.    </p>
<p>                                Equal parts funny and poignant, Still Just a Geek explores the folly of youth and the pain of experience &#8211; and all the strange, awful, beautiful adventures in between.</p>
