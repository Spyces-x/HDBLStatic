										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No other German has shaped the history of early-modern Europe more than Martin Luther.    </p>
<p>                    In this comprehensive and balanced biography we see Luther as a rebel, but not as a lone hero; as a soldier in a mighty struggle for the universal reform of Christianity and its role in the world. The foundation of Protestantism changed the religious landscape of Europe, and subsequently the world, but the author chooses to show not simply as a reformer, but as an individual.    </p>
<p>                    In his study of the Wittenberg monk, Heinz Schilling &#8211; one of Germany&#8217;s leading social and political historians &#8211; gives the reader a rounded view of a difficult, contradictory character, who changed the world by virtue of his immense will.</p>

<p>                    We are a nation in denial about our imperial past and the racism that plagues our present. Brit(ish) is Afua Hirsch&#8217;s personal and provocative exploration of how this came to be &#8211; and an urgent call for change.    </p>

                    FINALIST FOR THE CUNDILL HISTORY PRIZE 2020<br />

                    A FINANCIAL TIMES, OBSERVER, DAILY TELEGRAPH, WALL STREET JOURNAL AND TIMES BOOK OF THE YEAR    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Dalrymple is a superb historian with a visceral understanding of India &#8230; A book of beauty&#8217; &#8211;  Gerard DeGroot, The Times    </p>
<p>                    In August 1765 the East India Company defeated the young Mughal emperor and forced him to establish a new administration in his richest provinces. Run by English merchants who collected taxes using a ruthless private army, this new regime saw the East India Company transform itself from an international trading corporation into something much more unusual: an aggressive colonial power in the guise of a multinational business.    </p>
<p>                      William Dalrymple tells the remarkable story of the East India Company as it has never been told before, unfolding a timely cautionary tale of the first global corporate power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A litany of fresh heroes to make the embattled heart sing&#8217; Caitlin Moran<br />
                              &#8216;Newman is a brilliant writer&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                                A fresh, opinionated history of all the brilliant women you should have learned about in school but didn&#8217;t.    </p>
<p>                              For hundreds of years we have heard about the great men of history, but what about herstory?    </p>
<p>                              In this freewheeling history of modern Britain, Cathy Newman writes about the pioneering women who defied the odds to make careers for themselves and alter the course of modern history; women who achieved what they achieved while dismantling hostile, entrenched views about their place in society. Their role in transforming Britain is fundamental, far greater than has generally been acknowledged, and not just in the arts or education but in fields like medicine, politics, law, engineering and the military.    </p>
<p>                              While a few of the women in this book are now household names, many have faded into oblivion, their personal and collective achievements mere footnotes in history. We know of Emmeline Pankhurst, Vera Brittain, Marie Stopes and Beatrice Webb. But who remembers engineer and motorbike racer Beatrice Shilling, whose ingenious device for the Spitfires&#8217; Rolls-Royce Merlin fixed an often-fatal flaw, allowing the RAF&#8217;s planes to beat the German in the Battle of Britain? Or Dorothy Lawrence, the journalist who achieved her ambition to become a WW1 correspondent by pretending to be a man? And developmental biologist Anne McLaren, whose work in genetics paved the way for in vitro fertilisation?    </p>
<p>                              Blending meticulous research with information gleaned from memoirs, diaries, letters, novels and other secondary sources, Bloody Brilliant Women uses the stories of some extraordinary lives to tell the tale of 20th and 21st century Britain. It is a history for women and men. A history for our times.</p>
