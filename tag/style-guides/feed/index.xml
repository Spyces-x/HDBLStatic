										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A must-read for anyone interested in the art of intuitively knowing what others feel.&#8217; Haemin Sunim, author of The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down and Love for Imperfect Things     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A lovely book to have in your home and your lives.&#8217; Chris Evans, Breakfast Show<br />
                    ___________________________    </p>
<p>                    Nunchi (noon-chee): eye measure. The subtle art of gauging other people&#8217;s thoughts, and feelings in order to build trust, harmony and connection.<br />
                    ___________________________    </p>
<p>                    Why did she get promoted? Why does the party only start when he walks in? And why do they always catch the bartender&#8217;s eye? It sounds like they&#8217;re all experts in the art of nunchi, even if they don&#8217;t know it.     </p>
<p>                    Nunchi is the guiding principle of Korean life, but anyone can use it: it&#8217;s the art of reading a room, your way of understanding what other people are thinking and feeling, and using that to get ahead.    </p>
<p>                    Korean parents believe that teaching their children nunchi is as important as teaching them to cross the road safely. With great nunchi, it feels like the world is on your side. Without it, you might get hit by something you never saw coming.    </p>
<p>                    If you&#8217;re thinking &#8216;not another Eastern fad, Marie Kondo already made me throw half my clothes away&#8217;, don&#8217;t worry: it&#8217;s not a fad. Koreans have been using nunchi to overcome slings and arrows for over 5000 years.    </p>
<p>                    The great news is that anyone can hone their nunchi, immediately: all you need are your eyes and ears. In everything, from finding love to excelling at work, improving your nunchi will help you to open doors you never knew existed.    </p>
<p>                    Improve your nunchi, improve your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What really makes a relationship work? How can we stay interested in our partner for ever? How can we be happier in our marriage?     </p>
<p>                    Doctors John and Julie Gottman have spent over three decades studying the habits of 3000 couples. Within 10 minutes of meeting a couple, they can predict who will stay happily together or who will split up, with 94% accuracy. Based on their findings on the ingredients to a happy, lasting love life, they have now created an easy series of eight dates, spanning:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; commitment &#038; trust<br />
                    &#8211; conflict resolution<br />
                    &#8211; intimacy &#038; sex<br />
                    &#8211; fun &#038; adventure<br />
                    &#8211; work &#038; money<br />
                    &#8211; family values<br />
                    &#8211; growth &#038; spirituality<br />
                    &#8211; goals &#038; aspirations    </p>
<p>                    Eight Dates draws on rigorous scientific and psychological research about how we fall in love using case studies of real-life couples whose relationships have improved after committing time to each other and following the dates. Full of innovative exercises and conversation starters to explore ways to deepen each aspect of the relationship, Eight Dates is an essential resource that makes a relationship fulfilling.    </p>
