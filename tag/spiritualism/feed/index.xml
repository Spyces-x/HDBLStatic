										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Mornroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death.     </p>
<p>                    Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible&#8211;and reveals to us what it all means.     </p>
<p>                    Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies over the edge, beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the interstate&#8211;the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life&#8211;and of what lies beyond.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to venture beyond daily living and experience heightened states of awareness?     </p>
<p>                    In this highly anticipated new book, integrative medicine pioneer and New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra states that a higher state of consciousness is available here and now, for us all. Chopra unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations of the mind to access a field of infinite possibilities and reach our full potential. How do you achieve this? By becoming metahuman.    </p>
<p>                     Drawing from the latest research on neuroscience, artificial intelligence and biometrics, Chopra offers a practical 31 day guide to help us &#8216;wake up&#8217; at the deepest level in order to liberate ourselves from the conditioning and constructs that underlie anxiety, tension and ego driven demands. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Grasping this revolutionary idea will effectively remove the limiting belief systems and negativity that may be holding us back from achieving our maximum human potential. Highly recommended!&#8221; Dr Rudolph E. Tanzi    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Metahuman helps us harvest peak experiences so we can see our Truth and mold the universe&#8217;s chaos into a form that brings light to the world&#8217; Dr Mehmet Oz</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who are you becoming? That was the question nagging pastor and author John Mark Comer. By outward metrics, everything appeared successful. But inwardly, things weren&#8217;t pretty. So he turned to a trusted mentor for guidance and heard these words: &#8216;Ruthlessly eliminate hurry from your life. Hurry is the great enemy of the spiritual life.&#8217; It wasn&#8217;t the response he expected, but it continues to be the answer he needs.    </p>
<p>                    Too often we treat the symptoms of toxicity in our modern world instead of trying to pinpoint the cause. A growing number of voices are pointing at hurry, or busyness as a root of much evil. Within the pages of this book, you&#8217;ll find a compelling emotional and spiritual case against hurry and in favour of a slower, simpler way of life.</p>
