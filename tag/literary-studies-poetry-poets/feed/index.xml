										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new book by America&#8217;s leading literary critic on the uses of deep reading. Practical, inspirational and learned, How to Read and Why is Bloom&#8217;s manifesto for the preponderance of written culture.    </p>
<p>                              In the vastly influential The Western Canon, Harold Bloom outlined what we should read to understand a greater depth of the individual self. How to Read and Why continues the argument and focusses on how we use literature in order to gain deeper self-awareness. Poems, stories, novels, plays and parables are all analysed as forms of writing as immersion, the language of individuality and inwardness: Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets, the short stories of Hemingway and de Cervantes, the novels of Proust and Calvino, Sophocles&#8217;s Oedipus Rex and Mark&#8217;s Gospel. Harold Bloom also addresses the idea of why we read: increased individuality, respite from visual bombardment, a return to &#8216;deep feeling&#8217; and &#8216;deep thinking&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                              How to Read and Why is an essential book for any reader, an introduction to the world of written culture, an inspirational self-help book for students and teachers alike.</p>
