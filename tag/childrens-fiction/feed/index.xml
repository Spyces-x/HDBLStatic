										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Reptile Room the siblings endure a car accident, a terrible smell, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a brass reading lamp, and the re-appearance of a person they&#8217;d hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>

<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Vile Village the siblings face such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe cell, and some very strange hats.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Austere Academy the siblings face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E. and the metric system.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair.

<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Wide Window the siblings encounter a hurricane, a signalling device, hungry leaches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain and a doll named Pretty Penny.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

<p>                    Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne.     </p>
<p>                    Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on 30th July 2016. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Golding&#8217;s Lord of the Flies is a dystopian classic: &#8216;exciting, relevant and thought-provoking&#8217; (Stephen King). When a group of schoolboys are stranded on a desert island, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of my favorite books &#8211; I read it every couple of years.&#8217; (Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games)</p>
<p>                    A plane crashes on a desert island. The only survivors are a group of schoolboys. By day, they discover fantastic wildlife and dazzling beaches, learning to survive; at night, they are haunted by nightmares of a primitive beast. Orphaned by society, it isn&#8217;t long before their innocent childhood games devolve into a savage, murderous hunt &#8230; </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Stands out mightily in my memory &#8230; Such a strong statement about the human heart.&#8217; (Patricia Cornwell)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Terrifying and haunting.&#8217; (Kingsley Amis)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Beautifully written, tragic and provocative.&#8217; (E. M. Forster)</p>
<p>                    ONE OF THE BBC&#8217;S ICONIC &#8216;NOVELS THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD&#8217;</p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Every real human being should read this &#8230; This is what we are.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s brilliant, it&#8217;s captivating, it&#8217;s thought provoking and brutal and for some, its truly terrifying.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;There is a reason why this is studied at school &#8230; Excellent read.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is one of the few books I&#8217;ve read that I keep on my Kindle to read again.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I revisit this every few years and it&#8217;s always fresh and impressive &#8230; One of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217;</p>

As a result, Call has been imprisoned and interrogated. Everyone wants to know what Constantine was up to-and how he lives on.But Call has no idea.It is only when he&#8217;s broken out of prison that the full potential of Constantine&#8217;s plan is suddenly in his hands . . . and he must decide what to do with his power.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine     </p>
<p>                    #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King&#8217;s timeless novella &#8220;The Body&#8221;&#8211;originally published in his 1982 short story collection Different Seasons, and adapted into the 1986 film classic Stand by Me&#8211;is now available as a stand-alone publication.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s 1960 in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. Ray Brower, a boy from a nearby town, has disappeared, and twelve-year-old Gordie Lachance and his three friends set out on a quest to find his body along the railroad tracks. During the course of their journey, Gordie, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio come to terms with death and the harsh truths of growing up in a small factory town that doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of a future.     </p>
<p>                    A timeless exploration of the loneliness and isolation of young adulthood, Stephen King&#8217;s The Body is an iconic, unforgettable, coming-of-age story.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unpredictable events of a particular Tuesday unroll before the reader with the precision and clarity of a silent movie.   A Caldecott Medal book.  AUTHOR: David Wiesner is one of the best-loved and most highly acclaimed picture book creators in the world. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages and have won numerous awards in the United States and abroad. Three of the picture books he both wrote and illustrated became instant classics when they won the prestigious Caldecott Medal: Tuesday in 1992, The Three Pigs in 2002, and Flotsam in 2007, making him only the second person in the award&#8217;s long history to have won three times. He has also received two Caldecott Honors, for Free Fall and Sector 7.  REVIEWS: &#8220;Kids will love its lighthearted, meticulously imagined, fun-without-a-moral fantasy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The American revolution has begun&#8211;and Rush Revere, Liberty the horse, and the time-traveling crew are ready to ride into the action!     </p>
<p>                    Join us on this incredible time-travel adventure!     </p>
<p>                     Liberty, my wisecracking horse, our old friends Cam, Tommy, Freedom, and I are off to meet some super-brave soldiers in the year 1775. Yep, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll be visiting with the underdog heroes who fought for American independence, against all odds&#8211;and won! But not before eight very real years of danger and uncertainty. Be a part of Rush Revere&#8217;s crew as we rush, rush, rush into a time when British rule had become a royal pain, and rebellion was in the air. We&#8217;ll be on hand to see two lanterns hung in the Old North Church, prevent a British spy from capturing Paul Revere, and grapple with danger at the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.     </p>
<p>                     The extra special part of this trip is that right here in the twenty-first century, Cam&#8217;s dad is a soldier fighting in Afghanistan, and Cam has been pretty angry that he is away. Visiting with exceptional American heroes like Dr. Joseph Warren and George Washington, racing along after Paul Revere on his midnight ride, and seeing the Declaration of Independence signed make Cam see his own dad in a new and special way.     </p>
<p>                     But don&#8217;t worry. Along with the danger, excitement, and patriotism, there will still be time to stop for a delicious spinach, oats, and alfalfa smoothie. No, wait&#8211;that one&#8217;s for Liberty. The kids and I voted for strawberries.     </p>
<p>                     Now let&#8217;s open the magic portal to the past!</p>

Juntos somos mucho más fuertes, pero pronto tuvimos que separarnos para encontrar a los demás&#8230; Yo me fui a España a buscar a Siete y encontré mucho más, descubrí a un décimo miembro de la Guardia que había escapado de Lorien con vida: Ella. Es más joven que nosotros, pero tan valiente como cualquiera. Ahora buscamos a los otros, incluido a John. Sin embargo, ellos también nos buscan. Atraparon al número uno en Malasia. Al número dos en Inglaterra. Al número tres en Kenia. A mí me atraparon en Nueva York, pero escapé. Soy el número seis. Ellos quieren acabar lo que empezaron. Pero primero tendrán que enfrentarse a nosotros.&#8221;</p>

<p>A dance at Greg&#8217;s middle school has everyone scrambling to find a partner, and Greg is determined not to be left by the wayside. So he concocts a desperate plan to find someone anyone! to go with on the big night.</p>
<p>But Greg&#8217;s schemes go hilariously awry, and his only option is to attend the dance with his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and a female classmate as a &#8220;group of friends.&#8221; But the night is long, and anything can happen along the way. Who will arrive at the dance triumphantly, and who will end up being the third wheel?</p>
