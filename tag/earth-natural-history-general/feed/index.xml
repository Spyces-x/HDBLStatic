<p>                    &#8216;Hancock&#8217;s books provide a fascinating, alternative version of prehistory. America Before, detailed and wide-ranging, turns what was myth and legend into a new story of the past.&#8217; Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    Was an advanced civilization lost to history in the global cataclysm that ended the last Ice Age? Graham Hancock, the internationally bestselling author, has made it his life&#8217;s work to find out &#8212; and in America Before, he draws on the latest archaeological and DNA evidence to bring his quest to a stunning conclusion.</p>
<p>                    We&#8217;ve been taught that North and South America were empty of humans until around 13,000 years ago &#8211; amongst the last great landmasses on earth to have been settled by our ancestors. But new discoveries have radically reshaped this long-established picture and we know now that the Americas were first peopled more than 130,000 years ago &#8211; many tens of thousands of years before human settlements became established elsewhere.</p>
<p>                    Hancock&#8217;s research takes us on a series of journeys and encounters with the scientists responsible for the recent extraordinary breakthroughs. In the process, from the Mississippi Valley to the Amazon rainforest, he reveals that ancient &#8216;New World&#8217; cultures share a legacy of advanced scientific knowledge and sophisticated spiritual beliefs with supposedly unconnected &#8216;Old World&#8217; cultures. Have archaeologists focussed for too long only on the &#8216;Old World&#8217; in their search for the origins of civilization while failing to consider the revolutionary possibility that those origins might in fact be found in the &#8216;New World&#8217;?</p>
<p>                    America Before: The Key to Earth&#8217;s Lost Civilisation is the culmination of everything that millions of readers have loved in Hancock&#8217;s body of work over the past decades, namely a mind-dilating exploration of the mysteries of the past, amazing archaeological discoveries and profound implications for how we lead our lives today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What was George Washington&#8217;s secret weapon during the American Revolution, and how did it lead to Britain colonising Australia? What protected Popes for centuries? And what does Starbucks have to thank for its global domination? The answer to these questions and many more is: the mosquito. The mosquito has razed economies, determined the fates of empires and decided the outcome of pivotal wars. She only females bite has dispatched an estimated 52 billion people from a total of 108 billion ever to have lived. As the greatest purveyor of extermination we have known, she has played a greater role in shaping our history than any other living creature. The Mosquito is the extraordinary story of how a tiny bloodsucking fly indelibly changed our world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magic takes many forms. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods&#8217; bridge to earth. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality &#8211; science.    </p>
<p>                    Packed with inspiring explanations of space, time and evolution, laced with humour and clever thought experiments, The Magic of Reality explores a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? What causes tsunamis? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, inspirational detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist too.    </p>
<p>                    Richard Dawkins elucidates the wonders of the natural world to all ages with his inimitable clarity and exuberance in a text that will enlighten and inform for generations to come.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Mitch and his wife, Janine operate.    </p>
<p>                    Chika&#8217;s arrival made a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delighted the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika was suddenly diagnosed with a terminal disease that no doctor in Haiti could help with.    </p>
<p>                    Mitch and Janine took Chika to America, hoping that treatment there would enable her to go back home.  Instead, Chika became a permanent part of their lives, as they embarked on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika&#8217;s boundless optimism and humour taught Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learnt that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.    </p>
<p>                    This is Mitch Albom at his most poignant, powerful and personal. Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed &#8211; a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;An extraordinarily good book.&#8221; -Edward O. Wilson    </p>
<p>                    The lively and definitive story of the beauty, sexuality, lore, economics, and ecology of the world &#8216;s flowers, written by a devoted scientist and illustrated with his stunning photographs.    </p>
<p>                    Flowers-and the fruits they often become-feed, clothe, and inspire us. Indeed, they have done so for all of human history. Yet although we use flowers to celebrate important occasions, to express love, and to please our senses, we know little about them, their functions in nature, or even how we depend on them.    </p>
<p>                    In a volume that will delight gardeners, naturalists, cooks, artists, or anyone interested in history or culture, pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann serves as an expert guide through the fascinating world of flowers. He explains how other species relate to flowers in ways crucial to the natural world. Next he takes us on an engaging exploration of the roles flowers play in the production of food, spices, medicines, and perfumes. Flowering plants, Buchmann then shows, have long served as inspirational themes in art and literature. Flowers have in fact so thoroughly seduced us that we now buy some ten million a day, driving breeders to create infinite varieties and unusual blooms. In this cultural and natural investigation of floral history, Stephen Buchmann&#8217;s masterful narrative illuminates just why there is, indeed, a reason for flowers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Surprising. Impressive. Cannibalism restores my faith in humanity.&#8221; &#8211;Sy Montgomery, The New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                     For centuries scientists have written off cannibalism as a bizarre phenomenon with little biological significance. Its presence in nature was dismissed as a desperate response to starvation or other life-threatening circumstances, and few spent time studying it. A taboo subject in our culture, the behavior was portrayed mostly through horror movies or tabloids sensationalizing the crimes of real-life flesh-eaters. But the true nature of cannibalism&#8211;the role it plays in evolution as well as human history&#8211;is even more intriguing (and more normal) than the misconceptions we&#8217;ve come to accept as fact.    </p>
<p>                     In Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History,  zoologist Bill Schutt sets the record straight, debunking common myths and investigating our new understanding of cannibalism&#8217;s role in biology, anthropology, and history in the most fascinating account yet written on this complex topic. Schutt takes readers from Arizona&#8217;s Chiricahua Mountains, where he wades through ponds full of tadpoles devouring their siblings, to the Sierra Nevadas, where he joins researchers who are shedding new light on what happened to the Donner Party&#8211;the most infamous episode of cannibalism in American history. He even meets with an expert on the preparation and consumption of human placenta (and, yes, it goes well with Chianti).    </p>
<p>                     Bringing together the latest cutting-edge science, Schutt answers questions such as why some amphibians consume their mother&#8217;s skin; why certain insects bite the heads off their partners after sex; why, up until the end of the twentieth century, Europeans regularly ate human body parts as medical curatives; and how cannibalism might be linked to the extinction of the Neanderthals. He takes us into the future as well, investigating whether, as climate change causes famine, disease, and overcrowding, we may see more outbreaks of cannibalism in many more species&#8211;including our own.    </p>
<p>                     Cannibalism places a perfectly natural occurrence into a vital new context and invites us to explore why it both enthralls and repels us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the beloved and wildly popular host of the PBS Kids show Dinosaur Train, here is the book every parent needs: a rousing call to connect our kids to the natural world, filled with tips and advice.    </p>
<p>                    The average North American child now spends about seven hours a day staring at screens and mere minutes engaged in unstructured play outdoors. Yet recent research indicates that experiences in nature are essential for healthy growth.     </p>
<p>                    Regular exposure to nature can help relieve stress, depression, and attention deficits. It can reduce bullying, combat obesity, and boost academic scores. Most critical of all, abundant time in natural settings seems to yield long-term benefits in kids&#8217; cognitive, emotional, and social development.     </p>
<p>                    How to Raise a Wild Child is a timely and engaging antidote, offering teachers, parents, and other caregivers the necessary tools to engender a meaningful, lasting connection between children and the natural world.     </p>
<p>                    Distilling the latest research in multiple disciplines, Sampson reveals how adults can help kids fall in love with nature&#8211;enlisting technology as an ally, taking advantage of urban nature, and instilling a sense of place along the way.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;In a time when the connection between humans and the rest of nature is most vulnerable, Scott offers parents and teachers a book of encouragement and knowledge, and to children, the priceless gift of wonder.&#8221;&#8211;Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods and The Nature Principle</p>
