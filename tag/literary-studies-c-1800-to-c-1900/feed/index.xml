										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was not long after Halloween when Stephen King received a telephone call from his editor. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you do a book about the entire horror phenomenon as you see it? Books, movies, radio, TV, the whole thing.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The result is this unique combination of fantasy and autobiography, of classic horror writing honed to an unforgettable edge by the bestselling master of the genre.    </p>
<p>                    DANSE MACABRE ranges across the whole spectrum of horror in popular culture from the seminal classics of Dracula and Frankenstein. It is a charming and fascinating book, replete with pertinent anecdote and observation, in which Stephen King describes his ideas on how horror works on many levels and how he brings it to bear on his own inimitable novels.    </p>
<p>                    There is a reason why Stephen King is one of the bestselling writers in the world, ever. Described in the Guardian as an author who &#8216;knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers&#8217;, Stephen King writes books that draw you in and are impossible to put down.    </p>
