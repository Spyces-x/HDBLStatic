										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE ONE WHERE GREG GETS &#8220;THE TALK&#8221;</p>
<p>                     The fifth laugh-out-loud, fully-illustrated Diary of a Wimpy Kid book from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinney! A global phenomenon with 250 million copies of the series sold worldwide!</p>
<p>                    Greg Heffley has always been in a hurry to grow up. Being older means you can live alone, eat whatever you want for dinner and don&#8217;t have to share with your brothers. PERFECT.</p>
<p>                    At least, that&#8217;s what Greg thought, but it turns out there&#8217;s a lot more to growing up like dealing with boy/girl dances, increased responsibilities and awkward changes.</p>
<p>                    On top of all this, he&#8217;s fighting with this best friend Rowley, and is being dragged to his uncle&#8217;s FIFTH wedding. Surely there&#8217;s more to growing up than THIS?</p>

<p>                     Along with his friend Rowley, Greg&#8217;s desperate to prove his new maturity, which only going up a grade can bring. But when Rowley&#8217;s star starts to rise, will Greg be able to reach the same heights of popularity as his best friend? </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times bestselling author of the Sisters Grimm and NERDS comes the second book in an action-packed middle grade series with equal parts humor and heart!     </p>
<p>                    When Finn is saved from the Time Rangers by an older version of himself, it comes with a catch. Old Man Finn needs Finn and his friends, Lincoln and Julep, to help him win battles he lost years ago against the Paradox, a terrible creatures obsessed with revenge against Finn&#8217;s father. If they succeed, he promises to tell Finn where his father is. He even gives them a pair of time-traveling pajamas to help them with their quest.     </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s only one problem. The pajamas malfunction almost immediately. Along the way the kids avoid being eaten by sabretooths, shot by revolutionary war soldiers, and start a war with a town full of holograms, all in an effort to fix the jammies.     </p>
<p>                    Just when their goal is in sight, Julep gets sick. Only&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t seem like she&#8217;s sick. It seems like she&#8217;s changing. The adventure may cost Finn more than an old pair of pajamas&#8211;it may cost him his friends!    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

<p>                              It all starts when Chloe makes friends with Mr Stink, the local tramp. Yes, he smells a bit. But when it looks like he might be driven out of town, Chloe decides to hide him in the garden shed.    </p>
<p>                              Now Chloe&#8217;s got to make sure no one finds out her secret. And speaking of secrets, there just might be more to Mr Stink than meets the eye&#8230; or the nose.    </p>

<p>                    He was once an immortal God. Now, he&#8217;s a teenage boy called Lester. </p>
<p>                    Apollo has angered his father Zeus for the last time. </p>
<p>                    So, how do you punish an immortal?</p>

<p>                    It&#8217;s the first time he&#8217;s been without his powers, and he has to survive in the modern world.</p>
<p>                    Which isn&#8217;t an easy feat for a four-thousand-year old deity, especially one with as many enemies as he has. </p>
<p>                    Apollo needs help, and he can only think of one place to go . . . an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

<p>                    Which isn&#8217;t an easy feat for a four-thousand-year old deity, especially one with as many enemies as he has.     </p>
<p>                    Apollo needs help, and he can only think of one place to go . . . an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood.<br />

<p>                    He was once an immortal God, now he&#8217;s an awkward teenager. Things aren&#8217;t going well for Apollo. </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s only one way he can earn back Zeus&#8217; favour, and that&#8217;s to seek and restore the ancient oracles &#8211; but that&#8217;s easier said than done. </p>
<p>                    Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave may hold answers. </p>
<p>                    There are a few things standing in his way though. The cave could kill him, or drive him insane. </p>
<p>                    Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame.</p>
<p>                    To stay alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood. </p>
<p>                    Will he survive the greatest challenge of his four thousand year existence?<br />

<p>A dance at Greg&#8217;s middle school has everyone scrambling to find a partner, and Greg is determined not to be left by the wayside. So he concocts a desperate plan to find someone anyone! to go with on the big night.</p>
<p>But Greg&#8217;s schemes go hilariously awry, and his only option is to attend the dance with his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and a female classmate as a &#8220;group of friends.&#8221; But the night is long, and anything can happen along the way. Who will arrive at the dance triumphantly, and who will end up being the third wheel?</p>
