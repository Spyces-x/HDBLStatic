										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*As heard on the Tim Ferriss Show podcast*</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics is well researched, practical, and crammed with expert advice and it&#8217;s also an irreverent, hilarious page-turner.&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Gretchen Rubin </p>
<p>                    ABC News anchor Dan Harris used to think that meditation was for people who collect crystals, play the pan pipes, and use the word namaste without irony. After he had a panic attack on live television, he went on a strange journey that ultimately led him to become one of meditation&#8217;s most vocal public proponents.</p>
<p>                    Science suggests that meditation can lower blood pressure, mitigate depression and anxiety, and literally rewire key parts of the brain, among numerous other benefits. And yet there are millions of people who want to meditate but aren&#8217;t actually practising. What&#8217;s holding them back?</p>
<p>                    In this guide to mindfulness and meditation for beginners and experienced meditators alike, Harris and his friend Jeff Warren, embark on a cross-country quest to tackle the myths, misconceptions, and self-deceptions that stop people from meditating. They rent a rock-star tour bus and travel across the US, talking to scores of would-be meditators, including parents, police officers, and even a few celebrities. They create a taxonomy of the most common issues (&#8220;I suck at this,&#8221; &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the time,&#8221; etc.) and offer up science-based life hacks to help people overcome them.</p>
<p>                    The book is filled with game-changing and deeply practical meditation instructions. Amid it all unspools the strange and hilarious story of what happens when a congenitally sarcastic, type-A journalist and a groovy Canadian mystic embark on an epic road trip into America&#8217;s neurotic underbelly, as well as their own.</p>

<p>                    In today&#8217;s increasingly fast-paced world it can be difficult to find moments to catch your breath, regain inner balance, and just . . . be. This simple yet profound guide shows readers how to strengthen their minds by learning to focus attention, open awareness, and develop a positive state of mind&#8211;the three pillars of mindfulness practice that research shows lead to greater physical and mental well-being.     </p>
<p>                    Psychiatrist and cofounder of the Mindsight Institute, Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., created the science-grounded meditation practice called the Wheel of Awareness to unlock the power of the brain to integrate its many functions and develop internal resources that lead to an enduring sense of calm and quiet. Packed with guided meditation instructions, practical exercises, and everyday tools and techniques, Becoming Aware meets readers where they are and offers a simple program to enhance our inner sense of clarity and even our interpersonal well-being.    </p>

<p>                     Every day we speak around 16,000 words &#8211; but inside minds we create tens of thousands more. </p>
<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.</p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>                     Become aware of your true nature, learn to face your emotions with acceptance and generosity, act according to your deepest values, and flourish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; What if everything we think we know about how the world works&#8211;our ideas of love, education, spirituality, work, happiness, and love&#8211;are based on Brules (bullsh*t rules) that get passed from generation to generation and are long past their expiration date? </p>
<p>                    This book teaches you to think like some of the greatest non-conformist minds of our era, to question, challenge, hack, and create new rules for YOUR life so you can define success on your own terms. </p>
<p>                    The Code of the Extraordinary Mind is a blueprint of laws to break us free from the shackles of an ordinary life. It makes a case that everything we know about the world is shaped by conditioning and habit. And thus, most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything&#8211;love, work, money, parenting, sex, health, and more&#8211;which they inherit and pass on from generation to generation. </p>
<p>                    But what if you could remove these outdated ideas and start anew? What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past, and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you? </p>
<p>                    Not Just a Book, but a Movement<br />
                    Blending computational thinking, integral theory, modern spirituality, evolutionary biology, and humor, personal growth entrepreneur Vishen Lakhiani provides a revolutionary 10-point framework for understanding and enhancing the human self. You will learn about bending reality. You will learn how to apply unique models like consciousness engineering to help you learn and grow at speeds like never before.You will learn to make a dent in the universe and discover your quest. This framework is based on Lakhiani&#8217;s personal experiences, the 5 million people he&#8217;s reached through Mindvalley, and 200 hours of interviews and questions posed to incredible minds, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis, Ken Wilber, Dean Kamen, Arianna Huffington, Michael Beckwith, and other legendary leaders. </p>
<p>                    In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, irreverence, and a brilliant teaching style, Lakhiani reveals the 10 powerful laws that form a step-by-step process that you can apply to life to shed years of struggle and elevate yourself to exceptional new heights. </p>
<p>                    The 10 Laws to an Extraordinary Life<br />
                    This book challenges conventional ideas of relationships, goal-setting, mindfulness, happiness, and meaning. In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, and humorous irreverence, and not to mention, humor and napkin diagrams,  this framework combines computational thinking with personal growth to provide a powerful framework for re-coding yourself&#8211;and replacing old, limiting models that hold you back with new, empowering beliefs and behaviors that set you on the path toward an extraordinary life. A life of more happiness and achievement than you might have dared to dream possible. </p>
<p>                    Once you discover the code, you will question your limits and realize that there are none. Step into a new understanding of the world around you and your place in it, and find yourself operating at a new, extraordinary level in every way&#8230;happiness, purpose, fulfilment, and love. </p>
<p>                    This Book Is a Living, Breathing Manifesto That Goes Beyond a Traditional Publication<br />
                    For those who want more, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind connects to a full on immersive experience including ways for you to dive into particular chapters to unlock additional videos or training and connect with each other and the author to learn via peer-to-peer learning networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive work on the extraordinary phenomenon of out-of-body experiences, by the founder of the internationally known Monroe Institute. </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe, a Virginia businessman, began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbound by time or death. </p>
<p>                    Praise for Journeys Out of the Body </p>
<p>                    Monroe&#8217;s account of his travels, Journeys Out of the Body, jam-packed with parasitic goblins and dead humans, astral sex, scary trips into mind-boggling other dimensions, and practical tips on how to get out of your body, all told with wry humor, quickly became a cult sensation with its publication in 1971, and has been through many printings. Whatever their &#8216;real&#8217; explanation, Monroe&#8217;s trips made for splendid reading. &#8211;Michael Hutchinson, author of Megabrain </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe&#8217;s experiences are probably the most intriguing of any person&#8217;s of our time, with the possible exception of Carlos Castaneda&#8217;s. &#8211;Joseph Chilton Pierce, author of Magical Child </p>
<p>                    This book is by a person who&#8217;s clearly a sensible man and who&#8217;s trying to tell it like it is. No ego trips. Just a solid citizen who&#8217;s been &#8216;out&#8217; a thousand times now and wants to pass his experiences to others. &#8211;The Last Whole Earth Catalog</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we been visited by extraterrestrial beings? Did these ancient aliens contribute to the birth of human civilization? Do our ancient monuments contain evidence of their presence? The Ancient Alien Question reveals an array of astonishing truths, including: A radically different understanding of the pyramids and how they were constructed<br />
                    The origins of crystal skulls and how they were found<br />
                    The extraordinary stories behind monuments such as the Nazca lines and Puma Punku, and who built them<br />
                    How extraterrestrials came to our planet and the evidence that supports this Analyzing the historical and archaeological evidence, Philip Coppens demonstrates that there is substantial proof that our ancestors were far more technologically advanced than currently accepted, and that certain cultures interacted with non-human intelligences. Our ancestors were clearly not alone. Forty years after Erich von Däniken posed these questions in Chariots of the Gods, Coppens provides clear and concise answers to the great historical enigmas in a most accessible and readable format. Your view of human history will never be the same again!    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness is now all the rage. From celebrity endorsements to monks, neuroscientists and meditation coaches rubbing shoulders with CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it is clear that mindfulness has gone mainstream. Some have even called it a revolution. But what if, instead of changing the world, mindfulness has become a banal form of capitalist spirituality that mindlessly avoids social and political transformation, reinforcing the neoliberal status quo?</p>
<p>                    In McMindfulness, Ronald Purser debunks the so-called &#8220;mindfulness revolution,&#8221; exposing how corporations, schools, governments and the military have coopted it as a technique for social control and<br />
                    self-pacification. </p>
<p>                    A lively and razor-sharp critique, Purser busts the myths its salesmen rely on, challenging the narrative that stress is self-imposed and mindfulness is the cure-all. If we are to harness the truly revolutionary potential of mindfulness, we have to cast off its neoliberal shackles, liberating mindfulness for a collective awakening.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Mornroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death.     </p>
<p>                    Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible&#8211;and reveals to us what it all means.     </p>
<p>                    Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies over the edge, beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the interstate&#8211;the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life&#8211;and of what lies beyond.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Pollan keeps you turning the pages . . . cleareyed and assured.&#8221; -New York Times</p>
<p>A #1 New York Times Bestseller, New York Times Book Review 10 Best Books of 2018, and New York Times Notable Book</p>
<p>A brilliant and brave investigation into the medical and scientific revolution taking place around psychedelic drugs&#8211;and the spellbinding story of his own life-changing psychedelic experiences</p>
<p>When Michael Pollan set out to research how LSD and psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) are being used to provide relief to people suffering from difficult-to-treat conditions such as depression, addiction and anxiety, he did not intend to write what is undoubtedly his most personal book. But upon discovering how these remarkable substances are improving the lives not only of the mentally ill but also of healthy people coming to grips with the challenges of everyday life, he decided to explore the landscape of the mind in the first person as well as the third. Thus began a singular adventure into various altered states of consciousness, along with a dive deep into both the latest brain science and the thriving underground community of psychedelic therapists.  Pollan sifts the historical record to separate the truth about these mysterious drugs from the myths that have surrounded them since the 1960s, when a handful of psychedelic evangelists inadvertently catalyzed a powerful backlash against what was then a promising field of research.</p>
<p>A unique and elegant blend of science, memoir, travel writing, history, and medicine, How to Change Your Mind is a triumph of participatory journalism. By turns dazzling and edifying, it is the gripping account of a journey to an exciting and unexpected new frontier in our understanding of the mind, the self, and our place in the world. The true subject of Pollan&#8217;s &#8220;mental travelogue&#8221; is not just psychedelic drugs but also the eternal puzzle of human consciousness and how, in a world that offers us both suffering and joy, we can do our best to be fully present and find meaning in our lives.</p>
