										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Perfect for lovers of Quiet and The Power of Now, Emotional Agility shares a new way of relating to yourself and the world around you</p>
<p>                     Every day we speak around 16,000 words &#8211; but inside minds we create tens of thousands more. </p>
<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.</p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>                     Become aware of your true nature, learn to face your emotions with acceptance and generosity, act according to your deepest values, and flourish.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Essential reading&#8217; Susan Cain, author of Quiet</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A practical, science-backed guide to looking inward and living intentionally&#8217; Arianna Huffington, author of The Sleep Revolution</p>
<p>                    &#8216;An accessible, reader-friendly voyage. Emotional Agility can be helpful to anyone.&#8217; Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change your life in 2021 with the simple, scientifically proven method that has already worked for thousands of people.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Life has questions. They have answers&#8217; New York Times    </p>
<p>                     At last, a book that shows you how to build &#8211; design &#8211; a life you can thrive in, at any age or stage. A well-designed life means a life well-lived. Many of us are still looking for an answer to that perennial question, &#8216;What do I want to be when I grow up?&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     Stanford innovators Bill Burnett and Dave Evans show us how design thinking can help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who and where we are, our careers and our age. Designing Your Life puts forward the idea that the same design thinking responsible for amazing technology, products and spaces can be used to build towards a better life and career by a design of your own making.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;[Designing Your Life] teaches you how to change what&#8217;s not working by turning ideas on their head&#8217; Viv Groskop, author of How To Own The Room    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;An empowering book based on their popular class of the same name at Stanford University&#8230;this book will easily earn a place among career-finding classics&#8217; Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson, the authors of the New York Times bestseller Rework, are back with a manifesto to combat all your modern workplace worries and fears.    </p>
<p>                              It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a direct successor to Rework, the instant bestseller that showed readers a new path to working effectively. Now Fried and Heinemeier Hansson have returned with a new strategy for the ideal company culture &#8211; what they call &#8220;the calm company&#8221;. It is a direct attack on the chaos, anxiety and stress that plagues millions of workplaces and billions of people working their day jobs.    </p>
<p>                              Working to breaking point with long hours, excessive workload, and a lack of sleep have become a badge of honour for many people these days, when it should be a mark of stupidity. This isn&#8217;t just a problem for large organisations; individuals, contractors and solopreneurs are burning themselves out in the very same way. As the authors reveal, the answer isn&#8217;t more hours. Rather, it&#8217;s less waste and fewer things that induce distraction, always-on anxiety and stress.    </p>
<p>                              It is time to stop celebrating crazy and start celebrating calm.    </p>
<p>                              Fried and Hansson have the proof to back up their argument. &#8220;Calm&#8221; has been the cornerstone of their company&#8217;s culture since Basecamp began twenty years ago. Destined to become the management guide for the next generation, It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Crazy at Work is a practical and inspiring distillation of their insights and experiences. It isn&#8217;t a book telling you what to do. It&#8217;s a book showing you what they&#8217;ve done-and how any manager or executive no matter the industry or size of the company, can do it too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book that sparked a marketing revolution.<br />
                    &#8220;This is a subversive book. It says that the marketer is not&#8211;and ought not to be&#8211;at the center of successful marketing. The customer should be. Are you ready for that?&#8221; &#8211;From the Foreword by Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point.<br />
                    Counter to traditional marketing wisdom, which tries to count, measure, and manipulate the spread of information, Seth Godin argues that the information can spread most effectively from customer to customer, rather than from business to customer. Godin calls this powerful customer-to- customer dialogue the ideavirus, and cheerfully eggs marketers on to create an environment where their ideas can replicate and spread.<br />
                    In lively detail, Godin looks at the ways companies such as PayPal, Hotmail, GeoCities, even Volkswagen have successfully launched ideaviruses. He offers a &#8220;recipe&#8221; for creating your own ideavirus, identifies the key factors in the successful spread of an ideavirus (powerful sneezers, hives, a clear vector, a smooth, friction-free transmission), and shows how any business, large or small, can use ideavirus marketing to succeed in a world that just doesn&#8217;t want to hear it anymore from the traditional marketers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bestselling author of Head Strong and The Bulletproof Diet answers the question &#8220;How do I kick more ass?&#8221;-providing proven techniques for becoming happier, healthier, and smarter, culled from the wisdom and insight of world-class thought leaders and mavericks of science and business.    </p>
<p>                              When Dave Asprey started his Bulletproof Radio podcast more than five years ago, he sought out thought leaders and influencers in an array of disciplines, from biochemists to business titans to mediation masters. These folks were some of the top performing humans in the world, people who had changed their areas of study or even pioneered entirely new fields. Dave wanted to know: What did they have in common? What mattered most to them? What makes them so successful at what they do-and what makes them happiest? And so, at the end of each interview, Dave began asking the same question: &#8220;What are your top three recommendations for people who want to kick more ass?&#8221;<br />
                    Combing through the recordings, looking for patterns and common threads, he found that the wisdom gleaned from these highly successful people can be distilled into three main categories: body, mind, and spirit. Game Changers is the culmination of Dave&#8217;s years-long statistical analysis of these conversations, offering forty-six science-backed, high performance &#8220;laws&#8221; that are a virtual playbook for how to become not only more successful, but also happier and healthier.<br />
                    Each chapter of Game Changers is structured around one of these laws. Dave combines anecdotes from game changers like Daniel Amen, David Perlmutter, Arianna Huffington, Dan Harris, and Tim Ferriss with his own research and practical advice that readers can put into action immediately. From practising gratitude and mindfulness to prioritising social connections and sex, taming fear and anxiety to optimising nutrition and movement, Dave brings together the wisdom of today&#8217;s game-changers to help everyone optimise their lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you get the right balance in life you can do amazing things: create, perform, lead a team, build a great company, raise a family. But so often the scales tip and we feel overwhelmed and stressed.  Michael Townsend Williams, an adman turned yoga teacher and mindfulness coach, is an advocate of  welldoing    leading a busy and productive life, but not at the expense of our health and wellbeing. And key to this? Our breath.  The crucial link between mind and body, our breath reflects what we re dealing with at any given moment. It tells us when we re out of our depth.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With this simple, straightforward solution, you can switch your brain&#8217;s autopilot from habitual stress and anxiety to a mindset that is calm and wired for success.     </p>
<p>                    Stress debilitates and even damages the brain, inhibiting you from living life to the fullest. From your career to your family to your golf score, everything depends on higher brain networks functioning at optimum. That&#8217;s why alleviating stress is the key to success-and why changing your brain is the first step to sustaining more joy, peace, and fulfilment at every level of life.     </p>
<p>                    In The End of Stress, Don Joseph Goewey offers an easy, four-step method that will increase your brainpower and end anxiety. Drawing on the latest research in neuroscience and neuroplasticity, Goewey&#8217;s cutting-edge approach has been tested through webinars and seminars in high-stress environments and proven effective from chief executives, managers, and engineers to blue-collar construction workers.     </p>
<p>                    You have the power to reach your highest potential-but it all starts with the brain. The End of Stress gives you the tools you need to transcend stress and make every day your best day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nobody performs better under pressure. Regardless of the task, pressure ruthlessly diminishes our judgment, decision-making, attention, dexterity, and performance in every professional and personal arena. In Performing Under Pressure, Drs. Hendrie Weisinger and J.P. Pawliw-Fry introduce us to the concept of pressure management, offering empirically tested short term and long term solutions to help us overcome the debilitating effects of pressure.    </p>
<p>                     Performing Under Pressure tackles the greatest obstacle to personal success, whether in a sales presentation, at home, on the golf course, interviewing for a job, or performing onstage at Carnegie Hall. Despite sports mythology, no one rises to the occasion under pressure and does better than they do in practice. The reality is pressure makes us do worse, and sometimes leads us to fail utterly. But there are things we can do to diminish its effects on our performance.     </p>
<p>                     Performing Under Pressure draws on research from over 12,000 people, and features the latest research from neuroscience and from the frontline experiences of Fortune 500 employees and managers, Navy SEALS, Olympic and other elite athletes, and others. It offers 22 specific strategies each of us can use to reduce pressure in our personal and professional lives and allow us to better excel in whatever we do.     </p>
<p>                     Whether you&#8217;re a corporate manager, a basketball player, or a student preparing for the SAT, Performing Under Pressure will help you to do your best when it matters most.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leverage mindful awareness and intention to achieve better outcomes Overworked and Overwhelmed: The Mindfulness Alternative offers practical insights for the executive, manager or professional who feels like their RPM is maxed out in the red zone. By making the concepts and practices of mindfulness simple, practical and applicable, this book offers actionable hope for today&#8217;s overworked and overwhelmed professional. New research shows that the smartphone equipped professional is connected to work 72 hours a week. Forty eight percent of Americans report that their stress level is up and that the number one source of stress is the job pressure of a 24/7 world. What&#8217;s the alternative? Top leadership coach and educator Scott Eblin offers one in Overworked and Overwhelmed: The Mindfulness Alternative. While mindfulness is one of the &#8220;Top Ten Trends for 2014 and Beyond,&#8221; many professionals think it&#8217;s just too hard to give it a try. In this book, Eblin shows that mindfulness that makes a difference doesn&#8217;t require meditating like a Buddhist monk.<br />
                    Overworked and Overwhelmed is a handbook for more mindful work and living that offers: *&#8221;Must know&#8221; mindfulness basics that today&#8217;s professional needs to thrive in a 24/7 world. * Inspiring examples of mindfulness in action from dozens of leaders ranging from a U.S. Coast Guard Commandant to the CEO of Hilton Worldwide. * A self assessment for readers to understand how they perform at their best. * Simple routines to reduce stress and sustain peak performance. * A personal planning framework for creating the outcomes that matter most at home, at work and in the community. Even small increases in mindfulness can lead to big changes in productivity and quality of life for the overworked and overwhelmed professional. Overworked and Overwhelmed: The Mindfulness Alternative is a guide for doing just that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;This book is a gift! I&#8217;ve been practicing their strategies, and it&#8217;s a total game-changer.&#8221;&#8211;Brené Brown, PhD, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Dare to Lead     </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking book explains why women experience burnout differently than men&#8211;and provides a simple, science-based plan to help women minimize stress, manage emotions, and live a more joyful life.    </p>
<p>                     Burnout. Many women in America have experienced it. What&#8217;s expected of women and what it&#8217;s really like to be a woman in today&#8217;s world are two very different things&#8211;and women exhaust themselves trying to close the gap between them. How can you &#8220;love your body&#8221; when every magazine cover has ten diet tips for becoming &#8220;your best self&#8221;? How do you &#8220;lean in&#8221; at work when you&#8217;re already operating at 110 percent and aren&#8217;t recognized for it? How can you live happily and healthily in a sexist world that is constantly telling you you&#8217;re too fat, too needy, too noisy, and too selfish?     </p>
<p>                     Sisters Emily Nagoski, PhD, and Amelia Nagoski, DMA, are here to help end the cycle of feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Instead of asking us to ignore the very real obstacles and societal pressures that stand between women and well-being, they explain with compassion and optimism what we&#8217;re up against&#8211;and show us how to fight back. In these pages you&#8217;ll learn     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; what you can do to complete the biological stress cycle&#8211;and return your body to a state of relaxation<br />
                     &#8211; how to manage the &#8220;monitor&#8221; in your brain that regulates the emotion of frustration<br />
                     &#8211; how the Bikini Industrial Complex makes it difficult for women to love their bodies&#8211;and how to defend yourself against it<br />
                     &#8211; why rest, human connection, and befriending your inner critic are keys to recovering and preventing burnout     </p>
<p>                     With the help of eye-opening science, prescriptive advice, and helpful worksheets and exercises, all women will find something transformative in these pages&#8211;and will be empowered to create positive change. Emily and Amelia aren&#8217;t here to preach the broad platitudes of expensive self-care or insist that we strive for the impossible goal of &#8220;having it all.&#8221; Instead, they tell us that we are enough, just as we are&#8211;and that wellness, true wellness, is within our reach.     </p>
<p>                    NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BOOKRIOT     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Burnout is the gold standard of self-help books, delivering cutting-edge science with energy, empathy, and wit. The authors know exactly what&#8217;s going on inside your frazzled brain and body, and exactly what you can do to fix it. . . . Truly life-changing.&#8221;&#8211;Sarah Knight, New York Times bestselling author of Calm the F*ck Down</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in a third edition, Robert M. Sapolsky&#8217;s acclaimed and successful Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress. As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear &#8211; and the ones that plague us now &#8211; are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal&#8217;s does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way &#8211; through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humour and practical advice, Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses.<br />
                    This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fun, interesting, and useful read!&#8217; David Allen, bestselling author of Getting Things Done    </p>
<p>                    Nearly all of us want to be more productive, but finding the method that works for you among the hundreds and hundreds of different tips, tricks and hacks can be a daunting prospect. After graduating college, Chris Bailey decided to dedicate a whole year to doing just that &#8211; experimenting with as many of the techniques as he could, and finding the things that work. Among the experiments that he undertook are: going several weeks on little to no sleep; cutting out caffeine and sugar; taking a daily siesta; living in total isolation for 10 days; stretching his workweek to 90 hours; and getting up at 5:30 every morning,  all the while monitoring the impact of his experiments on the quality and quantity of his work. The results were often surprising!     </p>
<p>                    This book is the result of Chris&#8217;s year-long journey, distilling the lessons he learned into a few core truths about how we get things done (or, indeed, don&#8217;t).  Among the many counterintuitive insights Chris discovered that had the biggest impact on his productivity were striving for imperfection; scheduling less time for important tasks; the 20 second rule to distract yourself from distractions; and the concept of productive procrastination.     </p>
<p>                    In this accessible and fun guide, Chris Bailey offers over 30 tried-and-tested best practices that will help everyone to accomplish more &#8211; and become more awesome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Combines the gritty toughmindedness of the best coaches with the gentle-but-insistent inspiration of the most effective spiritual advisers&#8221; (Fast Company).     </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking New York Times bestseller has helped hundreds of thousands of people at work and at home balance stress and recovery and sustain high performance despite crushing workloads and 24/7 demands on their time.      </p>
<p>                    We live in digital time. Our pace is rushed, rapid-fire, and relentless. Facing crushing workloads, we try to cram as much as possible into every day. We&#8217;re wired up, but we&#8217;re melting down. Time management is no longer a viable solution. As bestselling authors Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz demonstrate in this groundbreaking book, managing energy, not time, is the key to enduring high performance as well as to health, happiness, and life balance. The Power of Full Engagement is a highly practical, scientifically based approach to managing your energy more skillfully both on and off the job by laying out the key training principles and provides a powerful, step-by-step program that will help you to:     </p>
<p>                     * Mobilize four key sources of energy<br />
                     * Balance energy expenditure with intermittent energy renewal<br />
                     * Expand capacity in the same systematic way that elite athletes do<br />
                     * Create highly specific, positive energy management rituals to make lasting changes     </p>
<p>                     Above all, this book provides a life-changing road map to becoming more fully engaged on and off the job, meaning physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused, and spiritually aligned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to defeat stress, worry, and anxiety to achieve more in business and life. From the international bestselling author of Self-Confidence. Are You A Worrier? Do you seem to worry more than most? Do you find that insignificant things stress you out? Do you sweat the small stuff and the big stuff too? Well, now s the time to stop worrying and start living. Worry, stress, anxiety whichever label you prefer to use can have consequences that impact not only our lives, but the lives of others around us. When we worry it s like the engine of our mind is constantly being revved up. It doesn t allow us time to switch off and rest. It tires you out. And when you re tired you re less likely to think straight. And when you re not thinking straight it s easy to make stupid mistakes and confuse priorities&#8230;But relax. There is a way forward. In How Not to Worry Paul McGee shows us that there is a way to tackle life s challenges in a calmer and more considered way. It is possible to use a certain degree of worry and anxiety to spur us on towards positive, constructive action, and then leave the rest behind.<br />
                    With down to earth, real life advice, How Not to Worry helps us understand why worrying is such a big deal and the reasons for it, exposing the behavioural traps we fall into when faced with challenges. It then helps us to move on with tools and ideas to deal with our worries in a more constructive way.</p>

<p>                    Richard O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s bestselling book Undoing Depression has become a touchstone in the field, helping thousands of therapists and patients overcome depressive patterns. In Rewire, O&#8217;Connor expands those ideas, showing how we actually have two brains-a conscious deliberate self and an automatic self that makes most of our decisions-and how we can train the latter to ignore distractions, withstand temptations, and interrupt reflexive, self-sabotaging responses. Rewire gives readers a road-map to overcoming the most common self-destructive habits, including procrastination, excessive worrying, internet addiction, overeating, risk-taking, and self-medication, among others. By learning valuable skills and habits-including mindfulness, self-control, confronting fear, and freeing yourself from mindless guilt-we can open ourselves to vastly more successful, productive, and happy lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Take a break and read Rest: you&#8217;ll make smarter decisions, have better relationships, and be happier and more creative&#8221; James Wallman, author of Stuffocation    </p>
<p>                     Do you regularly find yourself too tired after a long day at your desk to do anything other than binge TV, or scroll mindlessly through social media? Do you go on holiday and still compulsively check your email? Do you work through your lunch-break, often not even leaving your desk to get some fresh air?    </p>
<p>                     For most of us, overwork is the new norm, and we never truly take the time to rest and recharge. But as Silicon Valley consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang explains in this groundbreaking book, rest needs to be taken seriously and to be done properly, because when you rest better you work better.    </p>
<p>                     Drawing on emerging neuroscience, Rest is packed with easy practical tips for incorporating rest into our everyday:    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Go for a long walk to stimulate and sustain creativity<br />
                     &#8211; Schedule deliberate active rest periods into your diary to try out new activities like painting or learning a language<br />
                     &#8211; Stop working on a task when you know what the next step will be, this will make it easier to get started the next day<br />
                    &#8211; Establish clear boundaries between work and rest time<br />
                     &#8211; Take a nap during the day to increase alertness, boost your concentration and decrease fatigue<br />
                     &#8211; Get good quality sleep at night to stay healthy, solidify memories and generate new ideas    </p>
<p>                     When you rest better you&#8217;ll find that it won&#8217;t just be your work which improves &#8211; you&#8217;ll have more time for hobbies, stronger relationships and you&#8217;ll sleep better, too.    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An incredibly timely read for my own increasingly rest-starved life. This might be the book to finally persuade us that downtime isn&#8217;t in conflict with good work; rather, it&#8217;s an essential ingredient of it&#8221; Oliver Burkeman, Guardian</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Vanderkam is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in time management and productivity . . . her insights in Off the Clock can change your life&#8217; &#8211; Dorie Clark, author of Stand Out    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Laura Vanderkam delivers a compelling and evidence-based argument that busyness is overrated in our current culture. Living a full life, at work and at home, is about doing the right things well, and confidently missing out on everything else&#8217; &#8211; Cal Newport, bestselling author of Deep Work    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved it . . . Vanderkam expertly weaves together interviews with experts, anecdotes about her own personal life, philosophical musings, and scientific research&#8217; &#8211; Shana Lebowitz, Business Insider UK    </p>
<p>                    Learn to savour life&#8217;s best moments &#8211; no matter how busy you are &#8211; through mindset shifts that alter your perception of time.    </p>
<p>                    Laura Vanderkam, the acclaimed author of What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast, isn&#8217;t like other time-management gurus. She&#8217;s not trying to shave off 30 seconds here or there; she&#8217;s interested in the emotional and psychological side of the 168 hours everyone has each week. Her message is that we all have more time than we think we do, and can feel less stressed while getting more done.     </p>
<p>                    With the right habits, you can live efficiently and effectively, and yet still see time as abundant. For instance, Vanderkam teaches:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to clear your calendar of activities that are boring, stressful or simply not the best use of your time    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Why tackling your top priorities during the hours when you have the most energy will change your perception of what it means to be productive    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to linger in great experiences while they&#8217;re happening, and why good memories seem to make time expand    </p>
<p>                    Packed with insights from busy yet relaxed professionals, including &#8216;time makeovers&#8217; of people who are learning to use these tools, Off the Clock can inspire the rest of us to creative lives that are not only productive, but enjoyable in the moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering researcher gives us a new understanding of stress and trauma, as well as the tools to heal and thrive.    </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking book examines the cultural norms that impede resilience in America, especially our collective tendency to disconnect stress from its potentially extreme consequences and override our need to recover. It explains the science of how to direct our attention to perform under stress and recover from trauma, exploring how our survival brain and thinking brain react to traumatic situations differently.    </p>
<p>                    By directing our attention in particular ways, we can widen the window within which our thinking brain and survival brain work together cooperatively. When we use awareness to regulate our biology this way, we can access our best, uniquely human qualities: our compassion, courage, curiosity, creativity, and connection with others. By building our resilience, we can train ourselves to make wise decisions and access choice &#8211; even during times of incredible stress, uncertainty and change.    </p>
<p>                    With stories from men and women Dr Stanley has trained in settings as varied as military bases, healthcare facilities, as well as her own striking experiences with stress and trauma, she gives readers hands-on strategies they can use themselves, whether they want to perform under pressure or heal from traumatic experience, while at the same time pointing our understanding in a new direction.    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Bessel Van Der Kolk, bestselling author of The Body Keeps the Score.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Widen the Window is a comprehensive overview of stress and trauma, responses to it, and tools for healing and thriving. It&#8217;s not only for those in high-intensity work, but for everyone.&#8217; &#8211; Mindful Magazine</p>

<p>                     Every day we speak around 16,000 words &#8211; but inside minds we create tens of thousands more.     </p>
<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.    </p>
<p>                     Become aware of your true nature, learn to face your emotions with acceptance and generosity, act according to your deepest values, and flourish.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*As heard on the Tim Ferriss Show podcast*    </p>
<p>                    #1 New York Times bestseller and winner of the 2014 &#8216;Inspirational Memoir&#8217; category at the Living Now book awards.    </p>
<p>                    10% HAPPIER is a spiritual book written for &#8211; and by &#8211; someone who would otherwise never read a spiritual book. This fifth anniversary edition features a new preface and new guided meditations from his favourite teachers, including Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg.    </p>
<p>                    After having a nationally televised panic attack, Harris knew he had to make some changes. A lifelong non-believer, he found himself on a bizarre adventure and realised that the sources of his problems was the very thing he always thought was his greatest asset: the incessant, insatiable voice in his head, which had propelled him through the ranks of a hyper-competitive business, but had also led him to make the profoundly stupid decisions that provoked his on-air freak-out.     </p>
<p>                    What happened next was completely unforeseen. Through a strange series of events &#8211; Harris stumbled upon something that helped him tame the voice in his head: meditation. At first, he was deeply suspicious, but when confronted with mounting scientific evidence that just a few minutes a day can literally rewire the brain for focus, happiness and reduced reactivity, Harris took a deep dive. He became a daily meditator, and even found himself on a ten-day, silent meditation retreat.    </p>
<p>                    10% Happier is a narrative account of Dan&#8217;s conversion amid the harried and decidedly non-Zen world of the newsroom and concludes with a section for the beginner on how to get started.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved it&#8217; &#8211; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A wonderful book and excellent advice.&#8217; &#8211; Andy Puddicombe, founder of Headspace    </p>

<p>                      In this groundbreaking book, trend forecaster James Wallman finds that a rising number of people are turning away from all-you-can-get consumption, from the exec who&#8217;s sold almost everything he owns, to the well-off family who moved to a remote mountain cabin.    </p>
<p>                      In Stuffocation, Wallman&#8217;s solution is to focus less on possessions and more on experiences. It is a manifesto for a vital change in how you live &#8211; and it&#8217;s the one book you won&#8217;t be able to live without.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;courageous, compassionate, and rigorous every-person&#8217;s guide&#8221; (Christina Bethell, PhD, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) that shows the link between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)  and diseases, and how to cope and heal from these emotional traumas.    </p>
<p>                    Your biography becomes your biology. The emotional trauma we suffer as children not only shapes our emotional lives as adults, but it also affects our physical health, longevity, and overall well-being. Scientists now know on a bio-chemical level exactly how parents&#8217; chronic fights, divorce, death in the family, being bullied or hazed, and growing up with a hypercritical, alcoholic, or mentally ill parent can leave permanent, physical &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; on our brains.    </p>
<p>                    When children encounter sudden or chronic adversity, stress hormones cause powerful changes in the body, altering the body&#8217;s chemistry. The developing immune system and brain react to this chemical barrage by permanently resetting children&#8217;s stress response to &#8220;high,&#8221; which in turn can have a devastating impact on their mental and physical health as they grow up.    </p>
<p>                    Donna Jackson Nakazawa shares stories from people who have recognized and overcome their adverse experiences, shows why some children are more immune to stress than others, and explains why women are at particular risk. &#8220;Groundbreaking&#8221; (Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance) in its research, inspiring in its clarity, Childhood Disrupted explains how you can reset your biology-and help your loved ones find ways to heal. &#8220;A truly important gift of understanding-illuminates the heartbreaking costs of childhood trauma and like good medicine offers the promising science of healing and prevention&#8221; (Jack Kornfield, author of A Path With Heart).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER &#8211; OVER 1.5 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A deeply compassionate guide to self-care &#8211; simple and profound&#8217; Sir Kenneth Branagh    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you want to free yourself from anxiety and stress, and feel truly at ease with yourself, then read this book&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Authoritative, beautifully written and much-loved by its readers, Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world has become a word-of-mouth bestseller and global phenomenon. It reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that you can incorporate into daily life to break the cycle of anxiety, stress unhappiness and exhaustion. It promotes the kind of happiness that gets into your bones and allows you to meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.     </p>
<p>                    Mindfulness is based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Co-developed by Professor Mark Williams of Oxford University, MBCT is recommended by the UK&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is as effective as drugs for preventing depression. But, equally, it works for the rest of us who aren&#8217;t depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the relentless demands of the modern world.     </p>
<p>                    By investing just a few minutes each day, this classic guide to mindfulness will put you back in control of your life once again.</p>

<p>                     Dr. Joseph Annibali has treated thousands of people with overloaded, overstimulated brains. Some people describe their brain as being &#8220;in chaos&#8221;; others feel that their brain is &#8220;on fire.&#8221; But whether they are ultimately diagnosed with anxiety, disabling OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, or even substance abuse, the underlying problem is a Too-Busy Brain, a great irritant that interferes with attention, concentration, focus, mood, and often much more. It may even be a sign of undetected damage to either the brain or the body itself. But through practical strategies, understandable explanations, and prescriptive mind-management techniques, Dr. Annibali will help readers finally reclaim their brains and get back in control of their lives.</p>
