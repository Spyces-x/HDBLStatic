										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first work of non-fiction in English from the prize-winning and internationally bestselling author of Lullaby and Adele, translated by Sophie Lewis.     </p>
<p>                    In these essays, Leila Slimani gives voice to young Moroccan women who are grappling with a conservative Arab culture that at once condemns and commodifies sex. In a country where the law punishes and outlaws all forms of sex outside marriage, as well as homosexuality and prostitution, women have only two options for their sexual identities: virgin or wife. Sex and Lies is an essential confrontation with Morocco&#8217;s intimate demons and a vibrant appeal for the universal freedom to be, to love and to desire.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the religious historian whose The Gnostic Gospels won both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award comes a dramatic interpretation of Satan and his role on the Christian tradition. With magisterial learning and the elan of a born storyteller, Pagels turns Satan&#8217;s story into an audacious exploration of Christianity&#8217;s shadow side, in which the gospel of love gives way to irrational hatreds that continue to haunt Christians and non-Christians alike.    </p>

<p>                    As the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; and its aftermath sweep streets and squares, parliaments and presidential palaces of the Middle East, Shereen El Feki&#8211;an award-winning Canadian-Egyptian journalist&#8211;has been looking at unrest a little closer to home: in the sexual lives of Arab men and women. The result is an informative, insightful, and engaging account of this sensitive and still largely secret aspect of Arab society.     </p>
<p>                     Sexual attitudes and behaviors are shaped by politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations&#8211;not only a reflection of the conditions that led to the uprisings, but also a measure of hard-won reforms in the years to come. Highly personal, rich with original research and remarkable stories, Sex and the Citadel gives us unprecedented and timely insight into a part of the world that is changing before our eyes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of When Things Fall Apart, an open-hearted call for human connection, compassion, and learning to love the world just as it is during these most challenging times.      </p>
<p>                     In her first new book of spiritual teachings in over seven years, Pema Chödrön offers a combination of wisdom, heartfelt reflections, and the signature mix of humor and insight that have made her a beloved figure to turn to during times of change. In an increasingly polarized world, Pema shows us how to strengthen our abilities to find common ground, even when we disagree, and influence our environment in positive ways. Sharing never-before told personal stories from her remarkable life, simple and powerful everyday practices, and directly relatable advice, Pema encourages us all to become triumphant bodhisattvas&#8211;compassionate beings&#8211;in times of hardship.     </p>
<p>                     Welcoming the Unwelcome includes teachings on the true meaning of karma, recognizing the basic goodness in ourselves and the people we share our lives with&#8211;even the most challenging ones, transforming adversity into opportunities for growth, and freeing ourselves from the empty and illusory labels that separate us. Pema also provides step-by-step guides to a basic sitting meditation and a compassion meditation that anyone can use to bring light to the darkness we face, wherever and whatever it may be.</p>
