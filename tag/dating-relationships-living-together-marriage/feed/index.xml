										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this New York Times bestseller, Hollywood power couple DeVon Franklin and Meagan Good candidly share their courtship and marriage, and the key to their success-waiting.<br />
                         President/CEO of Franklin Entertainment and former Sony Pictures executive DeVon Franklin and award-winning actress Meagan Good have learned firsthand that some people must wait patiently for &#8220;the one&#8221; to come into their lives. They spent years crossing paths but it wasn&#8217;t until they were thrown together while working on the film Jumping the Broom that their storybook romance began.<br />
                         DeVon and Meagan chose to do something almost unheard of in today&#8217;s society-abstain from sex until they were married. The Wait is filled with candid his-and-hers accounts and practical advice on how waiting for everything-from dating to sex-can transform relationships.</p>

<p>                    Dating has never been easy. The road to true love has always been rutted with heartbreak, but do we have it any easier today?     </p>
<p>                    How did Victorians &#8216;come out&#8217;? How did love blossom in war-torn Europe? And why did 80s video-dating never take off?    </p>
<p>                    Bursting with little-known facts and tantalizing tales of lovelorn men and besotted women, Nichi Hodgson&#8217;s intriguing history of amorous relationships, from enamoured Georgians to frenziedly swiping millennials (and everyone in between) may leave you grateful that you live &#8211; and love &#8211; today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The #1 New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    **A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the Emmy-award winning star of Master of None and one of this generation&#8217;s sharpest comedic voices**    </p>
<p>                    In the old days, most people would find a decent person who lived in their village or neighbourhood, and after deciding they weren&#8217;t a murderer, get married and have kids &#8211; all by the age of 22.     </p>
<p>                    Now we spend years of our lives searching for our perfect soul mate and, thanks to dating apps, mobile phones and social media, we have more romantic options than ever before in human history. Yet we also have to confront strange new dilemmas, such as what to think when someone is too busy to reply to a text but has time to post a photo of their breakfast on Instagram. And if we have so many more options, why aren&#8217;t people any less frustrated?     </p>
<p>                    For years, American comedian Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at dating and relationships, and in Modern Romance, he teams up with award-winning sociologist Eric Klinenberg to investigate love in the age of technology. They enlisted some of the world&#8217;s leading social scientists, conducted hundreds of interviews, analyzed the behavioural data, and researched dating cultures from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to New York City. The result is an unforgettable picture of modern love, combining Ansari&#8217;s irreverent humour with cutting-edge social science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This original and lucid account of the complexities of love and its essential role in human well-being draws on the latest scientific research. Three eminent psychiatrists tackle the difficult task of reconciling what artists and thinkers have known for thousands of years about the human heart with what has only recently been learned about the primitive functions of the human brain.    </p>
<p>                    A General Theory of Love demonstrates that our nervous systems are not self-contained: from earliest childhood, our brains actually link with those of the people close to us, in a silent rhythm that alters the very structure of our brains, establishes life-long emotional patterns, and makes us, in large part, who we are. Explaining how relationships function, how parents shape their child&#8217;s developing self, how psychotherapy really works, and how our society dangerously flouts essential emotional laws, this is a work of rare passion and eloquence that will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When did humans begin to kiss? Why is kissing integral to some cultures and alien to others? Do good kissers make the best lovers? And is that expensive lip-plumping gloss worth it? Sheril Kirshenbaum, a marine biologist and science journalist, tackles these questions and more in THE SCIENCE OF KISSING. It&#8217;s everything you always wanted to know about kissing but either haven&#8217;t asked, can&#8217;t find out, or didn&#8217;t realize you should understand. Sheril&#8217;s a serious scientist, and the material here is informed by the results of the latest studies and theories, but she&#8217;s also got an engaging, delightful voice and offers information with a light, humorous touch. Topics range from the kind of kissing men like to do (as distinct from women), to what animals can teach us about the kiss, to whether or not the true art of kissing was lost sometime in the Dark Ages, to what, really, makes us kiss. Employing an interdisciplinary approach&#8211;drawing upon classical history, evolutionary biology, psychology, popular culture, and more&#8211;Kirshenbaum&#8217;s winning book will appeal to romantics and armchair scientists alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>_____________________________<br />
                    Is having &#8216;somebody to love&#8217; the most important thing in your life?<br />
                    Do you constantly believe in Mr Right, and that being with him would guarantee you would no longer feel depressed or lonely?<br />
                    Are you bored with &#8216;nice guys&#8217; who are open, honest and dependable?     </p>
<p>                    If being in love means being in pain, this book was written for you. Leading relationship and marriage therapist Robin Norwood describes loving too much as a pattern of thoughts and behaviour, which certain women develop as a response to problems from childhood.     </p>
<p>                    Many women find themselves repeatedly drawn into unhappy and destructive relationships with men. They then struggle to make these doomed relationships work. This bestselling relationship self-help book investigates and reveals how powerfully addictive these unhealthy relationships are &#8211; but also gives a very specific programme for recovery from the disease of loving too much, a problem that plagues women everywhere.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As women everywhere will attest, when it comes to understanding female sexuality, most guys know more about what&#8217;s under the hood of a car than under the hood of a clitoris. And while it seems that men have struggled valiantly since the dawn of time to find ways to reliably elicit the female orgasm, rare is the guy who has the modesty to ask: &#8220;What do I do?&#8221; Ironically, the answer has always been right there on the tip of his tongue.  Welcome to the world of &#8220;She Comes First, &#8221; where the mystery of female satisfaction is solved and the tongue is proven mightier than the sword. According to Ian Kerner, clinical sexologist and evangelist of the female orgasm, oral sex has long been deemed an optional aspect of foreplay, but, in fact, it&#8217;s coreplay &#8212; simply the best way for leading a woman through the entire process of sexual response.  Fun, informative, and easy to read, &#8220;She Comes First&#8221; is a virtual encyclopedia of female pleasure, detailing dozens of tried-and-true techniques for consistently satisfying a woman and illustrated step-by-step instructions to ensure success. These simple methods represent a new era in sexual intimacy, one in which the exchange of pleasure occurs on a level playing field and fulfillment is mutual.  &#8220;She Comes First&#8221; exuberantly offers a fresh new sexual philosophy that inspires every man to make a mantra of Rhett Butler&#8217;s infamous line to Scarlett O&#8217;Hara, &#8220;You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A radical, crystalline (Elle) approach to integrating our work, relationships, and inner selves from the bestselling author, poet, and speaker.      </p>
<p>                     The author of Crossing the Unknown Sea and The Heart Aroused encourages readers to reimagine how they inhabit the worlds of love, work, and self-understanding. Whyte suggests that separating these marriages in order to balance them is to destroy the fabric of happiness itself. Drawing from his own struggles and the lives of some of the world&#8217;s great writers and artists-from Dante to Jane Austen to Robert Louis Stevenson-Whyte explores the ways these core commitments are connected. Only by understanding the journey involved in each of the three marriages and the stages of their maturation, he says, can we understand how to bring them together in one fulfilled life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOW TO FIX A BROKEN HEART PROVIDES THE VALIDATION, COMFORT AND HOPE ANYONE WHO IS HEARTBROKEN DESPERATELY NEEDS.&#8217;<br />
                     ESTHER PEREL, BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE STATE OF AFFAIRS AND MATING IN CAPTIVITY     </p>
<p>                     Every one of us has or will have our heart broken at some point in our lives. Heartbreak, whether it comes in the form of romantic love or through loss, is universal, yet we know so little about how to deal with it. Psychologist Dr Guy Winch imagines how different our lives and our society would be if we paid more attention to this unique emotional pain.     </p>
<p>                     Heartbreak can last for days, weeks, months and even years. Yet while we wouldn&#8217;t expect someone to go to work or function well with a broken limb, heartbroken people are expected to function in their lives, despite the emotional pain they feel.     </p>
<p>                    How to Fix a Broken Heart argues that if we don&#8217;t understand how heartbreak works, we won&#8217;t be able to heal it and we are likely to make it worse, which we do, and regularly.     </p>
<p>                     Dr Winch reveals how and why heartbreak impacts our brain and our behaviour in dramatic and unexpected ways, regardless of our age. Emotional pain lowers our ability to reason, to think creatively, to problem solve and to function.    </p>
<p>                    Recovering from heartbreak always starts with a decision, a determination to move on when our mind is fighting to keep us stuck. We can take control of our lives and our minds and put ourselves on the path to healing. Dr Winch offers a toolkit on how to handle and cope with a broken heart and how to, eventually, move on.     </p>
<p>                     &#8216;A great read for anyone going through heartbreak, anyone trying to help someone go through heartbreak, or anyone who simply wants to understand humans better&#8217; Tim Urban, creator of Wait But Why?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astro Teller currently oversees Google[x] and Danielle Teller is a physician specializing in the fields of intensive care and lung medicine. Together, they bring a fresh and startling perspective on marriage and divorce in SACRED COWS.    </p>
<p>                     Drs. Astro and Danielle Teller know better than most that finding the right partner in life doesn&#8217;t always happen the first time around. Through their own divorces they learned how widely held cultural assumptions and misinformation that nobody thinks to question-what they refer to as &#8220;sacred cows&#8221;-create unnecessary heartache for people who are already suffering through a terrible time.    </p>
<p>                     Do you think, for example, that the divorce rate in the United States is rising? Or that children are harmed by divorce? Most people do, but it turns out that neither of these notions is supported by the data. Combining the rigor that has established them as leaders in their respective fields along with a dose of good-natured humor, the Tellers ask readers to take a fresh look at seven common sacred cows: the Holy Cow, the Expert Cow, the Selfish Cow, the Defective Cow, the Innocent Victim Cow, the One True Cow, and the Other Cow. This is not a book that is &#8220;for&#8221; marriage or &#8220;for&#8221; divorce, but &#8220;for&#8221; the freedom to decide how to live most honestly and happily either as part of a couple or a single person.    </p>
<p>                     In the same way that Esther Perel&#8217;s bestselling MATING IN CAPTIVITY gave couples a fresh perspective on their married life, so SACRED COWS invites readers to question assumptions and conventional wisdom. It offers a smart, insightful, and sympathetic view for those in a marital crisis, marriage counsellors, or anyone looking to gain a fresh perspective on one of our most cherished and misunderstood institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next Generation Indie Book Awards Winner in LGBT . &#8220;An important resource for readers of any age who are struggling to understand their sexual orientation, or those who would like to better understand asexuality.&#8221; -Library Journal, starred review<br />
                    Julie Sondra Decker&#8217;s book functions as a starting point for people interested in asexuality. It covers the basics of what asexuality is and isn&#8217;t, explores the most common issues asexual people may be dealing with, presents some pointers for newly asexual-identified people and the people who love them, and includes some resources to find out more. It&#8217;s for the layperson, written in everyday language.    </p>
<p>                    She writes for people who are on the asexual spectrum, people who think they might be asexual, friends and family and partners of people who have come out as asexual, curious parties, and those looking for information on the subject for their school papers, sexuality studies, and alternative sexuality resources. And it&#8217;s for people who think asexuality doesn&#8217;t exist. Chapters include:    </p>
<p>                    Asexuality as a Sexual Orientation<br />
                    Romantic Orientation<br />
                    Libido and Masturbation<br />
                    Intimate and Sexual Activity<br />
                    Asexual Relationships<br />
                    Asexual Community<br />
                    Should Asexual People Get Therapy and Be Fixed<br />
                    Am I Asexual?<br />
                    Should I Come Out?<br />
                    And much more    </p>
<p>                    If you think you may be asexual, or if you have a friend or partner who may be a sexual, this personal book will help you better understand what it means to be asexual in a world dominated by sexuality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Dr. Phil McGraw    </p>
<p>                    Ask yourself&#8230;are you truly who you want to be? Is this the life you really want? Are you living each day as your best self? What can you change, today?    </p>
<p>                    How would you answer those questions? Think about your daily life. Are you thriving, or going through the motions? Are your days full of work, relationships and activities that are true to your authentic self, or do you feel trapped on a treadmill of responsibility? If you dream of a better life, now is the time to turn your dream into reality. And the tools you need are within your grasp, to design a life that is fulfilling on the deepest levels. Best Self will show you how.    </p>
<p>                    Mike Bayer, known to the thousands of clients whose lives he has changed as Coach Mike, has helped everyone from pop stars to business executives to people just like you discover the freedom to be their best selves. By asking them and leading them to ask themselves a series of important but tough questions-such as &#8220;What are your core values?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you go to bed each day more knowledgeable than when you woke up?&#8221; and &#8220;Am I neglecting some aspect of my physical health out of fear or denial?&#8221;-he helps them see what their Best Selves and Anti-Selves really look like. As a mental health specialist, a personal development coach, and an all-around change agent, Mike has seen the amazing ways in which lives can improve with honesty and clarity.  He understands our struggles intimately, because he&#8217;s faced-and overcome-his own. And he knows that change is possible.     </p>
<p>                    By working through each of the Seven SPHERES of life-Social, Personal, Health, Education, Relationships, Employment and Spiritual Development-Best Self is an accessible and interactive book that distills all of Coach Mike&#8217;s wisdom into a compact, focused guide that will ignite anyone&#8217;s desire for change. Chock full of revealing quizzes, and full of provocative questionnaires, Best Self will empower you to embrace your authenticity, acknowledge what is holding you back, and break through to live a passionate life to the fullest, forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why didn&#8217;t he call you back? Why doesn&#8217;t he talk to your friends? Why does he keep putting off your dates? This book has the answers. Now the international bestseller is re-released to change the lives of a new generation.    </p>
<p>                              This is a hilarious, playful, honest explanation of male behaviour from a writer and a consultant of Sex and the City. Stop wasting your time chasing after men who aren&#8217;t into you, and find men who are! Greg Behrendt provides the insight you need to move on and find them.    </p>
<p>                              The idea behind &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; came from a conversation between Greg Behrendt and his fellow (female) SATC writers, when they asked his advice one day. This conversation became the seed of an episode which struck a powerful chord with viewers. Before long, Greg became aware that this simple phrase had the power to change women&#8217;s lives.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; is now a worldwide phenomenon. Over 100k copies have been sold across all editions, it has topped bestseller charts internationally, and has been made into a major Hollywood film. Now repackaged for a new generation with an eyecatching new cover, He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You is essential armour for the modern woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leading clinical psychologist Lisa Damour identifies the seven key phases marking the journey from girlhood to womanhood, and offers practical advice for those raising teenage girls.    </p>
<p>                    We expect an enormous amount from our teenage girls in a world where they are bombarded with messages about how they should look, behave, succeed. Yet we also speak as though adolescence is a nightmare rollercoaster ride for both parent and child, to be endured rather than enjoyed.     </p>
<p>                    In Untangled, world authority and clinical psychologist Lisa Damour provides an accessible, detailed, comprehensive guide to parenting teenage girls. She believes there is a predictable blueprint for how girls grow; seven easily recognisable &#8216;strands&#8217; of transition from childhood through adolescence and on to adulthood. Girls naturally develop at different rates, typically on more than one front, and the transition will be unique to every girl.     </p>
<p>                    Each chapter describes a phase, such as &#8216;contending with adult authority&#8217; and &#8216;entering the romantic world&#8217;, with hints and tips for parents and daughters, and a &#8216;when to worry&#8217; section. Damour writes sympathetically and clearly, providing a practical and helpful guide for any parent, and for teenage girls too.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this must-have for anyone who wants to better understand their love life, a mathematician pulls back the curtain and reveals the hidden patterns&#8211;from dating sites to divorce, sex to marriage&#8211;behind the rituals of love.     </p>
<p>                    The roller coaster of romance is hard to quantify; defining how lovers might feel from a set of simple equations is impossible. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that mathematics isn&#8217;t a crucial tool for understanding love.     </p>
<p>                    Love, like most things in life, is full of patterns. And mathematics is ultimately the study of patterns&#8211;from predicting the weather to the fluctuations of the stock market, the movement of planets or the growth of cities. These patterns twist and turn and warp and evolve just as the rituals of love do.     </p>
<p>                    In The Mathematics of Love, Dr. Hannah Fry takes the reader on a fascinating journey through the patterns that define our love lives, applying mathematical formulas to the most common yet complex questions pertaining to love: What&#8217;s the chance of finding love? What&#8217;s the probability that it will last? How do online dating algorithms work, exactly? Can game theory help us decide who to approach in a bar? At what point in your dating life should you settle down?     </p>
<p>                    From evaluating the best strategies for online dating to defining the nebulous concept of beauty, Dr. Fry proves&#8211;with great insight, wit, and fun&#8211;that math is a surprisingly useful tool to negotiate the complicated, often baffling, sometimes infuriating, always interesting, mysteries of love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A hands-on, real talk guide for navigating the hot-button issues that so many families struggle with&#8221; &#8211; Reese Witherspoon    </p>
<p>                    Do you find yourself taking on the lion&#8217;s share of all the thankless, invisible but time-consuming work in the home? FAIR PLAY is the first book that shows you that there can be a different way: a way to get more done, with less fuss, in a way that feels more balanced.    </p>
<p>                    Eve Rodsky is changing society one relationship at a time, by coming up with a 21st-century solution to an age-old problem: women shouldering the brunt of domestic responsibilities, the mental load, the emotional labour. Everything that is required to keep the fridge full, the children&#8217;s homework in their bags, and the household running. The unequal division of all this invisible work in relationships is a recipe for disaster, but no one has offered a real solution to this dilemma, until now.     </p>
<p>                    Eve Rodsky was tired of always being the one who has to remember to buy loo roll, or to book the family&#8217;s dentist appointments, or to send the thank you cards &#8211; all while working full time. So Eve decided to do what she does every day as an organisational management consultant: Organise. She conducted original research with more than 500 couples to figure out WHAT the invisible work in a family actually is and HOW to get it done effectively and all in a way that makes relationships even stronger. FAIR PLAY identifies the 100 main tasks in any relationship, and then divides those tasks fairly (not necessarily equally) so that both parties contribute their fair share.     </p>
<p>                    If we don&#8217;t learn to rebalance our home life and reclaim some time to develop the skills and passions that keep us unique, then we risk losing our right to be interesting, not just to our partner, but to ourselves. Getting this right isn&#8217;t a luxury, it&#8217;s a necessity for a happy, lasting partnership. Part how-to guide for couples, part modern relationship manifesto, FAIR PLAY offers an innovative system with a completely original lexicon to discuss how relationships actually work &#8230; and how we can make them work better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most relationship problems are essentially trust issues, explains psychotherapist David Richo. Whether it&#8217;s fear of commitment, insecurity, jealousy, or a tendency to be controlling, the real obstacle is a fundamental lack of trust&#8211;both in ourselves and in our partner.     </p>
<p>                    Daring to Trust offers key insights and practical exercises for exploring and addressing our trust issues in relationships. Topics include     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How we learn early in life to trust others (or not to trust them)<br />
                     &#8211; Why we fear trusting<br />
                    &#8211; Developing greater trust in ourselves as the basis for trusting others<br />
                    &#8211; How to know if someone is trustworthy<br />
                    &#8211; Naive trust vs. healthy, adult trust<br />
                    &#8211; What to do when trust is broken     </p>
<p>                    Ultimately, Richo explains, we must develop trust in four directions: toward ourselves, toward others, toward life as it is, and toward a higher power or spiritual path. These four types of trust are not only the basis of healthy relationships, they are also the foundation of emotional well-being and freedom from fear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The word &#8220;love&#8221; is most often defined as a noun, yet&#8230;we would all love better if we used it as a verb,&#8221; writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.  As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question &#8220;What is love?&#8221; her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society&#8217;s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the &#8220;100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.&#8221; All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.</p>

<p>                     If you&#8217;re single and searching, there&#8217;s no end to other people&#8217;s explanations, excuses, and criticism explaining why you haven&#8217;t found a partner:     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;You&#8217;re too picky. Just find a good-enough guy and you&#8217;ll be fine.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8220;You&#8217;re too desperate. If men think you need them, they&#8217;ll run scared.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8220;You&#8217;re too independent. Smart, ambitious women always have a harder time finding mates.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8220;You have low self-esteem. You can&#8217;t love someone else until you&#8217;ve learned to love yourself.&#8221;<br />
                     &#8220;You&#8217;re too needy. You can&#8217;t be happy in a relationship until you&#8217;ve learned to be happy on your own.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     Based on one of the most popular Modern Love columns of the last decade, Sara Eckel&#8217;s It&#8217;s Not You challenges these myths, encouraging singletons to stop picking apart their personalities and to start tapping into their own wisdom about who and what is right for them. Supported by the latest psychological and sociological research, as well as interviews with people who have experienced longtime singledom, Eckel creates a strong and empowering argument to understand and accept that there&#8217;s no one reason why you&#8217;re single&#8211;you just are.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.    </p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.    </p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.     </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Does anyone date anymore?&#8221; Today, the authorities tell us that courtship is in crisis. But when Moira Weigel dives into the history of sex and romance in modern America, she discovers that authorities have always said this. Ever since young men and women started to go out together, older generations have scolded them: That&#8217;s not the way to find true love. The first women who made dates with strangers were often arrested for prostitution; long before &#8220;hookup culture,&#8221; there were &#8220;petting parties&#8221;; before parents worried about cell phone apps, they fretted about joyrides and &#8220;parking.&#8221; Dating is always dying. But this does not mean that love is dead. It simply changes with the economy. Dating is, and always has been, tied to work.     </p>
<p>                    Lines like &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick you up at six&#8221; made sense at a time when people had jobs that started and ended at fixed hours. But in an age of contract work and flextime, many of us have become sexual freelancers, more likely to text a partner &#8220;u still up?&#8221; Weaving together over one hundred years of history with scenes from the contemporary landscape, Labor of Love offers a fresh feminist perspective on how we came to date the ways we do. This isn&#8217;t a guide to &#8220;getting the guy.&#8221; There are no ridiculous &#8220;rules&#8221; to follow. Instead, Weigel helps us understand how looking for love shapes who we are&#8211;and hopefully leads us closer to the happy ending that dating promises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blending memoir, literary exposition, and revealing case studies, Unrequited is a powerful, surprising, and empathetic cultural and psychological exploration of one-sided romantic obsession.    </p>
<p>                    The summer Lisa A. Phillips turned thirty, she fell in love with someone who didn&#8217;t return her feelings. She soon became obsessed. She followed him around, called him compulsively, and talked about him endlessly. One desperate morning, after she snuck into his apartment building, he picked up a baseball bat to protect himself and began to dial 911. Her unrequited love had changed her from a sane, conscientious college teacher and radio reporter into someone she barely recognized&#8211;someone who was taking her yearning much too far.    </p>
<p>                    In Unrequited, Phillips explores the tremendous force of obsessive love in women&#8217;s lives. She argues that it needs to be understood, respected, and channeled for personal growth&#8211;yet it also has the potential to go terribly awry. Interweaving her own story with frank interviews and in-depth research in science, psychology, cultural history, and literature, Phillips describes how romantic obsession takes root, grows, and strongly influences our thoughts and behaviors.    </p>
<p>                    Going beyond images of creepy, fatally attracted psychos, male fantasies of unbridled female desire, and the platitudes of self-help books, Phillips reveals a powerful, troubling, and surprisingly common phenomenon. As she illuminates this mysterious psychological experience, placing it in a rich and nuanced context, she offers compelling insights to help any woman who has experienced unrequited obsessive love and been mystified and troubled by its grip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;After years of debate and inquiry, the key to a great marriage remained shrouded in mystery. Until now&#8230;&#8221;&#8211;Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success     </p>
<p>                    Eli J. Finkel&#8217;s insightful and ground-breaking investigation of marriage clearly shows that the best marriages today are better than the best marriages of earlier eras. Indeed, they are the best marriages the world has ever known. He presents his findings here for the first time in this lucid, inspiring guide to modern marital bliss.     </p>
<p>                    The All-or-Nothing Marriage reverse engineers fulfilling marriages&#8211;from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; to the utterly nontraditional&#8211;and shows how any marriage can be better.     </p>
<p>                    The primary function of marriage from 1620 to 1850 was food, shelter, and protection from violence; from 1850 to 1965, the purpose revolved around love and companionship. But today, a new kind of marriage has emerged, one oriented toward self-discover, self-esteem, and personal growth. Finkel combines cutting-edge scientific research with practical advice; he considers paths to better communication and responsiveness; he offers guidance on when to recalibrate our expectations; and he even introduces a set of must-try &#8220;lovehacks.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    This is a book for the newlywed to the empty nester, for those thinking about getting married or remarried, and for anyone looking for illuminating advice that will make a real difference to getting the most out of marriage today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What really makes a relationship work? How can we stay interested in our partner for ever? How can we be happier in our marriage?     </p>
<p>                    Doctors John and Julie Gottman have spent over three decades studying the habits of 3000 couples. Within 10 minutes of meeting a couple, they can predict who will stay happily together or who will split up, with 94% accuracy. Based on their findings on the ingredients to a happy, lasting love life, they have now created an easy series of eight dates, spanning:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; commitment &#038; trust<br />
                    &#8211; conflict resolution<br />
                    &#8211; intimacy &#038; sex<br />
                    &#8211; fun &#038; adventure<br />
                    &#8211; work &#038; money<br />
                    &#8211; family values<br />
                    &#8211; growth &#038; spirituality<br />
                    &#8211; goals &#038; aspirations    </p>
<p>                    Eight Dates draws on rigorous scientific and psychological research about how we fall in love using case studies of real-life couples whose relationships have improved after committing time to each other and following the dates. Full of innovative exercises and conversation starters to explore ways to deepen each aspect of the relationship, Eight Dates is an essential resource that makes a relationship fulfilling.    </p>
