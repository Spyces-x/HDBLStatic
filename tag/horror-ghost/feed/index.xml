<p>                    When poor farm boy Eragon finds a polished stone in the forest, he thinks it&#8217;s a lucky discovery. Perhaps, he will be able to buy his family food for the winter.     </p>
<p>                    But, when a baby dragon hatches out of the stone, Eragon realises he&#8217;s stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.     </p>
<p>                    His simple life is shattered, and he&#8217;s thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic and power. To navigate this dark terrain, and survive his cruel king&#8217;s evil ways, he must take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders.     </p>
<p>                    Will he succeed? The fate of the Empire rests in his hands. . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this New York Times bestselling sequel to Kerri Maniscalco&#8217;s haunting #1 debut Stalking Jack the Ripper, bizarre murders are discovered in the castle of Prince Vlad the Impaler, otherwise known as Dracula. Could it be a copycat killer . . . or has the depraved prince been brought back to life?     </p>
<p>                     Following the grief and horror of her discovery of Jack the Ripper&#8217;s true identity, Audrey Rose Wadsworth has no choice but to flee London and its memories. Together with the arrogant yet charming Thomas Cresswell, she journeys to the dark heart of Romania, home to one of Europe&#8217;s best schools of forensic medicine . . . and to another notorious killer, Vlad the Impaler, whose thirst for blood became legend.     </p>
<p>                     But her life&#8217;s dream is soon tainted by blood-soaked discoveries in the halls of the school&#8217;s forbidding castle, and Audrey Rose is compelled to investigate the strangely familiar murders. What she finds brings all her terrifying fears to life once again.</p>
