										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Language is always changing, but the way English is spoken today rubs many of us the wrong way. Whether it&#8217;s the use of literally to mean &#8220;figuratively,&#8221; or the way young people use LOL or business jargon like What&#8217;s the ask?&#8211;it often seems as if the language is deteriorating before our eyes.     </p>
<p>                    But the truth is different and a lot less scary. Drawing examples from everyday life and employing a generous helping of humor, John McWhorter shows that these shifts are common to all languages, and that we should embrace these changes, not condemn them.     </p>
<p>                    He opens our eyes to the surprising backstories to words and expressions we use every day. Did you know that silly once meant &#8220;blessed&#8221;? Or that ought was the original past tense of owe? Or that the suffix -ly in adverbs is actually a remnant of the word like?     </p>
<p>                    In Words on the Move, McWhorter encourages us to marvel at the dynamism and resilience of the English language, and his book offers a delightful journey where we see that words are ever on the move and our lives are all the richer for it.</p>
