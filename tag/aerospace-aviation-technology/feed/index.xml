										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wildly vivid and entertaining chronicle of America&#8217;s manned space program, from the author of The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test    </p>
<p>                    `What is it&#8217; asks Tom Wolfe, `that makes a man willing to sit on top of an enormous Roman Candle&#8230;and wait for someone to light the fuse?&#8217; Arrogance? Stupidity? Bravery? Courage? Or, simply, that quality we call &#8216;the right stuff&#8217;?    </p>
<p>                    A monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space program, and a dizzying dive into the sweat, fear, beauty and danger of being on the white-hot edge of history in the making.    </p>
<p>                    `Tom Wolfe at his very best&#8230; Learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic&#8230;The Right Stuff is superb&#8217; &#8211; New York Times Book Review    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Top 10 Sunday Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                                NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE<br />
                    Oscar Nominated For Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay    </p>
<p>                                Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA&#8217;s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America&#8217;s space program.    </p>
<p>                              Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as &#8216;Human Computers&#8217;, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these &#8216;colored computers&#8217; used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets, and astronauts, into space.    </p>
<p>                              Moving from World War II through NASA&#8217;s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War, and the women&#8217;s rights movement, Hidden Figures interweaves a rich history of mankind&#8217;s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1940s and 50s, when the newly minted Jet Propulsion Laboratory needed quick-thinking mathematicians to calculate velocities and plot trajectories, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women&#8211;known as &#8220;human computers&#8221;&#8211;who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews, Nathalia Holt offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we&#8217;ve been, and the far reaches of space to which we&#8217;re heading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back on the earth after three spaceflights, Chris Hadfield&#8217;s captivating memoir An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth reveals extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality.    </p>
<p>                    Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4,000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft, and become a YouTube sensation with his performance of David Bowie&#8217;s &#8216;Space Oddity&#8217; in space. The secret to Chris Hadfield&#8217;s success &#8211; and survival &#8211; is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst &#8211; and enjoy every moment of it.    </p>
<p>                    In his book, An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth, Chris Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement &#8211; and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counter-intuitive lessons: don&#8217;t visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff.    </p>
<p>                    You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Colonel Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights in this book will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth &#8211; especially your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The incredible true story of the origin of human flight, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough.    </p>
<p>                     On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.    </p>
<p>                     Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?    </p>
<p>                     David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly human story of Wilbur and Orville Wright. Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing.    </p>
<p>                     In this thrilling book, McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers&#8217; story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them.</p>
