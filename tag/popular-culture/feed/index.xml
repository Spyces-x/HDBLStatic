										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We now live in two Americas. One,now the minority,functions in a print-based, literate world that can cope with complexity and can separate illusion from truth. The other,the majority,is retreating from a reality-based world into one of false certainty and magic. To this majority,which crosses social class lines, though the poor are overwhelmingly affected,presidential debate and political rhetoric is pitched at a sixth-grade reading level. In this  other America,&#8221; serious film and theatre, as well as newspapers and books, are being pushed to the margins of society. In the tradition of Christopher Lasch&#8217;s  The Culture of Narcissism  and Neil Postman&#8217;s  Amusing Ourselves to Death , Pulitzer Prize-winner Chris Hedges navigates this culture,attending WWF contests, the Adult Video News Awards in Las Vegas, and Ivy League graduation ceremonies,to expose an age of terrifying decline and heightened self-delusion.    </p>

<p>                    The Kennedys have always been a family of charismatic adventurers, raised to take risks and excel, living by the dual family mottos: &#8220;To whom much is given, much is expected&#8221; and &#8220;Win at all costs.&#8221; And they do&#8211;but at a price.     </p>
<p>                    Across decades and generations, the Kennedys have occupied a unique place in the American imagination: charmed, cursed, at once familiar and unknowable. The House of Kennedy is a revealing, fascinating account of America&#8217;s most storied family, as told by America&#8217;s most trusted storyteller.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distrust That Particular Flavor &#8211; an acclaimed nonfiction collection by William Gibson, bestselling author of Neuromancer</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The future&#8217;s already here: it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed&#8217;</p>
<p>                    William Gibson was writing fiction when he predicted the internet. And as his stories bled into reality so he became one of the first to report on the real-world consequences of cyberspace&#8217;s growth and development.</p>
<p>                    Now, with the dust settling on the first internet revolution, comes Gibson&#8217;s first collection of non-fiction &#8211; essays from the technological and cultural frontiers of this new world. </p>
<p>                    Covering a variety of subjects, they include:</p>
<p>                    &#8211; Metrophagy &#8211; the Art and Science of Digesting Great Cities<br />
                    &#8211; An account of obsession in &#8216;the world&#8217;s attic&#8217; &#8211; eBay<br />
                    &#8211; Reasons why &#8216;The Net is a Waste of Time&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Singapore as &#8216;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; A primer on Japan, our default setting for the future </p>
<p>                    These and many other pieces, collected for the first time in Distrust that Particular Flavour, are studded with revealing autobiographical fragments and map the development of Gibson&#8217;s acute perceptions about modern life. Readers of Neal Stephenson, Ray Bradbury and Iain M. Banks will love this book.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Gibson is a prophet and a satirist, a black comedian and an astounding architect of cool. He&#8217;s also responsible for much of the world we live in&#8217; Spectator</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Part-detective story, part-cultural snapshot &#8230; all bound by Gibson&#8217;s pin-sharp prose&#8217; Arena</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness is now all the rage. From celebrity endorsements to monks, neuroscientists and meditation coaches rubbing shoulders with CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it is clear that mindfulness has gone mainstream. Some have even called it a revolution. But what if, instead of changing the world, mindfulness has become a banal form of capitalist spirituality that mindlessly avoids social and political transformation, reinforcing the neoliberal status quo?</p>
<p>                    In McMindfulness, Ronald Purser debunks the so-called &#8220;mindfulness revolution,&#8221; exposing how corporations, schools, governments and the military have coopted it as a technique for social control and<br />
                    self-pacification. </p>
<p>                    A lively and razor-sharp critique, Purser busts the myths its salesmen rely on, challenging the narrative that stress is self-imposed and mindfulness is the cure-all. If we are to harness the truly revolutionary potential of mindfulness, we have to cast off its neoliberal shackles, liberating mindfulness for a collective awakening.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Compelling, haunting, tragic stories  . . . resonate long after you put the book down&#8217; James McConnachie, Sunday Times Book of the Year      </p>
<p>                    The routine traffic stop that ends in tragedy. The spy who spends years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon. The false conviction of Amanda Knox. Why do we so often get other people wrong? Why is it so hard to detect a lie, read a face or judge a stranger&#8217;s motives?    </p>
<p>                    Using stories of deceit and fatal errors to cast doubt on our strategies for dealing with the unknown, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual adventure into the darker side of human nature, where strangers are never simple and misreading them can have disastrous consequences.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;A hugely enjoyable romp through the pleasures and pitfalls of setting up home in a foreign land.&#8217;- Guardian    </p>
<p>                    Given the opportunity of a new life in rural Jutland, Helen Russell discovered a startling statistic: Denmark, land of long dark winters, cured herring, Lego and pastries, was the happiest place on earth.    </p>
<p>                    Keen to know their secrets, Helen gave herself a year to uncover the formula for Danish happiness.    </p>
<p>                    From childcare, education, food and interior design to SAD and taxes, The Year of Living Danishly records a funny, poignant journey, showing us what the Danes get right, what they get wrong, and how we might all live a little more Danishly ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    In this new edition, six years on Helen reveals how her life and family have changed, and explores how Denmark, too &#8211; or. her understanding of it &#8211; has shifted. It&#8217;s a messy and flawed place, she concludes &#8211; but can still be a model for a better way of living.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavioral economist and New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our general behaviour, up close and personal.    </p>
<p>                              In The Upside of Irrationality, behavioral economist Dan Ariely will explore the many ways in which our behaviour often leads us astray in terms of our romantic relationships, our experiences in the workplace, and our temptations to cheat. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.    </p>
<p>                              Among the topics Dan explores are:<br />
                    * What we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy;<br />
                    * How we learn to love the ones we are with;<br />
                    * Why online dating doesn&#8217;t work, and how we can improve on it;<br />
                    * Why learning more about people make us like them less;<br />
                    * Why large bonuses can make CEOs less productive;<br />
                    * How to really motivate people at work;<br />
                    * Why bad directions can help us;<br />
                    * How we fall in love with our ideas;<br />
                    * How we are motivated by revenge; and<br />
                    * What motivates us to cheat.    </p>
<p>                              Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational such a hit, Dan will emphasize the important role that irrationality plays in our day-to-day decisionmaking-not just in our financial marketplace, but in the most hidden aspects of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this delightful and original book, Jonathan Gottschall offers the first unified theory of storytelling. Drawing on neuroscience and evolutionary biology, The Storytelling Animal explores what stories reveal about human nature, how we process information, and think about the world.<br />
                    Humans live in landscapes of make-believe. We spin fantasies. We devour novels, films, and plays. Even sporting events and criminal trials unfold as narratives. Gottschall argues that stories help us navigate life&#8217;s complex social problems &#8212; just as flight simulators prepare pilots for difficult situations. Storytelling has evolved, like other behaviors, to ensure our survival. Gottschall tells us what it means to be a storytelling animal and explains how stories can change the world for the better.<br />
                    We know we are master shapers of story. The Storytelling Animal finally reveals how stories shape us.<br />

<p>                    &#8216;Amanda Palmer joyfully shows a generation how to change their lives&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To read Amanda Palmer&#8217;s remarkable memoir about asking and giving is to tumble headlong into her world&#8217; Elizabeth Gilbert    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The Art of Asking is a book about cultivating trust and getting as close as possible to love, vulnerability, and connection. Uncomfortably close. Dangerously close. Beautifully close&#8217; Brene Brown    </p>
<p>                    Imagine standing on a box in the middle of a busy city, dressed as a white-faced bride, and silently using your eyes to ask people for money. Or touring Europe in a punk cabaret band, and finding a place to sleep each night by reaching out to strangers on Twitter. For Amanda Palmer, actions like these have gone beyond satisfying her basic needs for food and shelter &#8211; they&#8217;ve taught her how to turn strangers into friends, build communities, and discover her own giving impulses. And because she had learned how to ask, she was able to go to the world to ask for the money to make a new album and tour with it, and to raise over a million dollars in a month.    </p>
<p>                    In the New York TImes bestseller The Art of Asking, Palmer expands upon her popular TED talk to reveal how ordinary people, those of us without thousands of Twitter followers and adoring fans, can use these same principles in our own lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in the age of speed. We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to a breaking point. Consider these facts: Americans on average spend seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car, a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold, and American adults currently devote on average a mere half hour per week to making love.    </p>
<p>                    Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. In Praise of Slowness traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time and tackles the consequences of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace &#8212; and living happier, healthier, and more productive lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place.    </p>
<p>                    Here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a preindustrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by cell-phone using, e-mailing lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word &#8212; balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where they may have been least expected &#8212; in slowing down.    </p>
<p>                    In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honoré details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry. In Praise of Slowness is the first comprehensive look at the worldwide Slow movements making their way into the mainstream &#8212; in offices, factories, neighborhoods, kitchens, hospitals, concert halls, bedrooms, gyms, and schools. Defining a movement that is here to stay, this spirited manifesto will make you completely rethink your relationship with time.</p>

<p>                    In the Robert Taylor Homes projects on Chicago&#8217;s South Side, Sudhir befriends J.T., a gang leader for the Black Kings. As he slowly gains J.T.&#8217;s trust, one day, in order to convince Sudhir of his own CEO-like qualities, J.T. makes him leader of the gang&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Why does J.T. make his henchmen, the &#8216;shorties&#8217;, stay in school? What is the difference between a &#8216;regular&#8217; hustler and a &#8216;hype&#8217; &#8211; and is Peanut telling him the truth about which she is? And, when the FBI finally starts cracking down on the Black Kings, is it time to get out &#8211; or is it too late?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Jon Ronson, the Sunday Times top ten bestselling author of The Psychopath Test, this is a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world&#8217;s most underappreciated forces: shame.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s about the terror, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of what?&#8217; I said.<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of being found out.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us &#8211; people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they&#8217;re being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.    </p>
<p>                    A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people&#8217;s faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.    </p>
<p>                    Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be, So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws &#8211; and the very scary part we all play in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An extraordinary book . . . It will shake up your most fundamental beliefs about everyday experience, and it just might change your life.&#8217; Paul Bloom<br />
                    ___    </p>
<p>                    For the millions of people who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris&#8217;s new book is a guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.    </p>
<p>                     Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experience of contemplatives such as Jesus, Buddha and other saints and sages of history-and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.    </p>
<p>                    Waking Up is part seeker&#8217;s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris-a scientist, philosopher, and famous sceptic-could write it.<br />
                     ___    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A demanding, illusion-shattering book.&#8217; Kirkus Reviews<br />

<p>                    Named a Best Book of 2019 by TIME, Amazon, and The Washington Post    </p>
<p>                    A Wired Must-Read Book of Summer       </p>
<p>                    “Gretchen McCulloch is the internet’s favorite linguist, and this book is essential reading. Reading her work is like suddenly being able to see the matrix.” —Jonny Sun, author of everyone&#8217;s a aliebn when ur a aliebn too       </p>
<p>                    Because Internet is for anyone who&#8217;s ever puzzled over how to punctuate a text message or wondered where memes come from. It&#8217;s the perfect book for understanding how the internet is changing the English language, why that&#8217;s a good thing, and what our online interactions reveal about who we are.      </p>
<p>                    Language is humanity&#8217;s most spectacular open-source project, and the internet is making our language change faster and in more interesting ways than ever before. Internet conversations are structured by the shape of our apps and platforms, from the grammar of status updates to the protocols of comments and @replies. Linguistically inventive online communities spread new slang and jargon with dizzying speed. What&#8217;s more, social media is a vast laboratory of unedited, unfiltered words where we can watch language evolve in real time.     </p>
<p>                    Even the most absurd-looking slang has genuine patterns behind it. Internet linguist Gretchen McCulloch explores the deep forces that shape human language and influence the way we communicate with one another. She explains how your first social internet experience influences whether you prefer &#8220;LOL&#8221; or &#8220;lol,&#8221; why ~sparkly tildes~ succeeded where centuries of proposals for irony punctuation had failed, what emoji have in common with physical gestures, and how the artfully disarrayed language of animal memes like lolcats and doggo made them more likely to spread.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Virginia Heffernan &#8220;melds the personal with the increasingly universal in a highly informative analysis of what the Internet is-and can be. A thoroughly engrossing examination of the Internet&#8217;s past, present, and future&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews, starred review) from one of the best living writers of English prose.    </p>
<p>                    This book makes a bold claim: The Internet is among mankind&#8217;s great masterpieces-a massive work of art. As an idea, it rivals monotheism. But its cultural potential and its societal impact often elude us. In this deep and thoughtful book, Virginia Heffernan reveals the logic and aesthetics behind the Internet, just as Susan Sontag did for photography and Marshall McLuhan did for television.    </p>
<p>                    Life online, in the highly visual, social, portable, and global incarnation rewards certain virtues. The new medium favors speed, accuracy, wit, prolificacy, and versatility, and its form and functions are changing how we perceive, experience, and understand the world. In &#8220;sumptuous writing, saturated with observations that are simultaneously personal, cultural, and strikingly original&#8221; (The New Republic), Heffernan presents &#8220;a revealing look at how the Internet continues to reshape our lives emotionally, visually, and culturally&#8221; (The Smithsonian Magazine). &#8220;Magic and Loss is an illuminating guide to the Internet&#8230;it is impossible to come away from this book without sharing some of Heffernan&#8217;s awe for this brave new world&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this time of great frustration, this collection is a clearing in the woods to meet, to reflect, to dance, and to cackle around the fire.&#8217;<br />
                    Abbi Jacobson, creator of Broad City and New York Times bestselling author of I Might Regret This    </p>
<p>                    From the moment powerful men started falling to the #MeToo movement, the lamentations began: this is feminism gone too far, this is injustice, this is a witch hunt. In The Witches Are Coming, firebrand author of the New York Times bestselling memoir and now critically acclaimed Hulu TV series Shrill, Lindy West, turns that refrain on its head. You think this is a witch hunt? Fine. You&#8217;ve got one.     </p>
<p>                    In a laugh-out-loud, incisive cultural critique, West unpacks the complicated, and sometimes tragic, politics of not being a white man in the twenty-first century. She tracks the misogyny and propaganda hidden (or not so hidden) in the media that she and her peers devoured growing up, a buffet of distortions, delusions, prejudice and outright bullsh*t that has allowed white male mediocrity to maintain a death grip on our culture and our politics &#8211; and that delivered us to this precarious, disorienting moment in history.     </p>
<p>                    We cannot understand how we got here &#8211; how the land of the free became Trump&#8217;s America &#8211; without examining the chasm between who we are and who we think we are, without fact-checking the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves and about each other. The truth can transform us; there is witchcraft in it. Lindy West turns on the light.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Lindy continues to be one of the funniest, smartest writers around.&#8217;<br />
                    Jessica Valenti, New York Times bestselling author of Full Frontal Feminism and Sex Object    </p>

                    phenomenon. It is, in fact, a modern emotion: before 1800, its language did not exist. And where loneliness is identified, it is not always bad, but a complex emotional state that differs according to class, gender, ethnicity and experience.    </p>
<p>                    Looking at informative case studies such as Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria, and Virginia Woolf, A Biography of Loneliness charts the emergence of loneliness as a modern and embodied emotional state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book is a house of wonders&#8217; The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Steven Johnson is the Darwin of technology&#8217; Walter Issacson, author of Steve Jobs    </p>
<p>                    What connects Paleolithic bone flutes to the invention of computer software? Or the Murex sea snail to the death of the great American city? How does the bag of crisps you hold in your hand help tell the story of humanity itself?     </p>
<p>                    In his brilliant new work on the history of innovation, international bestseller Steven Johnson argues that the pursuit of novelty and wonder has always been a powerful driver of world-shaping technological change. He finds that  that throughout history, the cutting edge of innovation lies wherever people are working the hardest to keep themselves and others amused.     </p>
<p>                    Johnson&#8217;s storytelling is just as delightful as the inventions he describes, full of surprising stops along the journey from simple concepts to complex modern systems. He introduces us to the colourful innovators of leisure: the explorers, proprietors, showmen, and artists who changed the trajectory of history with their luxurious wares, exotic meals, taverns, gambling tables, and magic shows.    </p>
<p>                    Johnson compellingly argues that observers of technological and social trends should be looking for clues in novel amusements. You&#8217;ll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Roxane Gay is so great at weaving the intimate and personal with what is most bewildering and upsetting at this moment in culture. She is always looking, always thinking, always passionate, always careful, always right there.&#8221; &#8212; Sheila Heti, author of How Should a Person Be?    </p>
<p>                    A New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    Best Book of the Year: NPR &#8211; Boston Globe &#8211; Newsweek &#8211; Time Out New York &#8211; Oprah.com &#8211; Miami Herald &#8211; Book Riot &#8211; Buzz Feed &#8211; Globe and Mail (Toronto) &#8211; The Root &#8211; Shelf Awareness    </p>
<p>                    A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism from one of the most-watched cultural observers of her generation    </p>
<p>                    In these funny and insightful essays, Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of color (The Help) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.    </p>
<p>                    Bad Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better, coming from one of our most interesting and important cultural critics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  &#8220;The authors make this unassuming, most studious woman come pulsing to life&#8230;Notorious RBG may be a playful project, but it asks to be read seriously&#8230;That I responded so personally to it is a testimony to [its] storytelling and panache.&#8221;- Jennifer Senior, New York Times  Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg never asked for fame-she has only tried to make the world a little better and a little freer.  But nearly a half-century into her career, something funny happened to the octogenarian: she won the internet. Across America, people who weren&#8217;t even born when Ginsburg first made her name as a feminist pioneer are tattooing themselves with her face, setting her famously searing dissents to music, and making viral videos in tribute.  Notorious RBG, inspired by the Tumblr that amused the Justice herself and brought to you by its founder and an award-winning feminist journalist, is more than just a love letter. It draws on intimate access to Ginsburg&#8217;s family members, close friends, colleagues, and clerks, as well an interview with the Justice herself.<br />
                    An original hybrid of reported narrative, annotated dissents, rare archival photos and documents, and illustrations, the book tells a never-before-told story of an unusual and transformative woman who transcends generational divides. As the country struggles with the unfinished business of gender equality and civil rights, Ginsburg stands as a testament to how far we can come with a little chutzpah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestseller about two guys who went out for coffee and dreamed up Seinfeld-&#8220;A wildly entertaining must-read not only for Seinfeld fans but for anyone who wants a better understanding of how television series are made&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).    </p>
<p>                    Comedians Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld never thought anyone would watch their sitcom about a New York comedian sitting around talking to his friends. But against all odds, viewers did watch-first a few and then many, until nine years later nearly forty million Americans were tuning in weekly. Fussy Jerry, neurotic George, eccentric Kramer, and imperious Elaine-people embraced them with love.    </p>
<p>                    Seinfeldia, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong&#8217;s intimate history is full of gossipy details, show trivia, and insights into how famous episodes came to be. Armstrong celebrates the creators and fans of this American television phenomenon, bringing readers into the writers&#8217; room and into a world of devotees for whom it never stopped being relevant. Seinfeld created a strange new reality, one where years after the show had ended the Soup Nazi still spends his days saying &#8220;No soup for you!&#8221;, Joe Davola gets questioned every day about his sanity, and Kenny Kramer makes his living giving tours of New York sites from the show.    </p>
<p>                    Seinfeldia is an outrageous cultural history. Dwight Garner of The New York Times Book Review wrote: &#8220;Armstrong has an eye for detail&#8230;.Perhaps the highest praise I can give Seinfeldia is that it made me want to buy a loaf of marbled rye and start watching again, from the beginning.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone needs to love and be loved-even men. But to know love, men must be able to look at the ways that patriarchal culture keeps them from knowing themselves, from being in touch with their feelings, from loving.    </p>
<p>                    In The Will to Change, bell hooks gets to the heart of the matter and shows men how to express the emotions that are a fundamental part of who they are-whatever their age, marital status, ethnicity, or sexual orientation. But toxic masculinity punishes those fundamental emotions, and it&#8217;s so deeply ingrained in our society that it&#8217;s hard for men to not comply-but hooks wants to help change that.    </p>
<p>                    With trademark candor and fierce intelligence, hooks addresses the most common concerns of men, such as fear of intimacy and loss of their patriarchal place in society, in new and challenging ways. She believes men can find the way to spiritual unity by getting back in touch with the emotionally open part of themselves-and lay claim to the rich and rewarding inner lives that have historically been the exclusive province of women. A brave and astonishing work, The Will to Change is designed to help men reclaim the best part of themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the dramatic story of how a noted tech venture capitalist, an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and investor in his company, woke up to the serious damage Facebook was doing to our society and set out to try to stop it.    </p>
<p>                              If you had told Roger McNamee three years ago that he would soon be devoting himself to stopping Facebook from destroying democracy, he would have howled with laughter. He had mentored many tech leaders in his illustrious career as an investor, but few things had made him prouder, or been better for his fund&#8217;s bottom line, than his early service to Mark Zuckerberg. Still a large shareholder in Facebook, he had every good reason to stay on the bright side. Until he simply couldn&#8217;t.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is McNamee&#8217;s intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head of one of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing. It&#8217;s a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author&#8217;s dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors. Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face.     </p>
<p>                              And then comes Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has been put. To McNamee&#8217;s shock, Facebook&#8217;s leaders still duck and dissemble, viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travellers who share his concerns, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention economy more broadly &#8211; to our public health and to our political order.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is both an enthralling personal narrative and a masterful explication of the forces that have conspired to place us all on the horns of this dilemma. This is the story of a company and its leadership, but it&#8217;s also a larger tale of a business sector unmoored from normal constraints, at a moment of political and cultural crisis, the worst possible time to be given new tools for summoning the darker angels of our nature and whipping them into a frenzy. This is a wise, hard-hitting, and urgently necessary account that crystallizes the issue definitively for the rest of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in times of increasing inscrutability. Our news feeds are filled with unverified, unverifiable speculation, much of it automatically generated by anonymous software. As a result, we no longer understand what is happening around us. Underlying all of these trends is a single idea: the belief that quantitative data can provide a coherent model of the world, and the efficacy of computable information to provide us with ways of acting within it. Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather, it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension.    </p>
<p>                    In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted Enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, and the hollowing out of empathy. Surveying the history of art, technology and information systems he reveals the dark clouds that gather over discussions of the digital sublime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BRILLIANT&#8217; Chris Evans, Virgin Radio Breakfast Show    </p>
<p>                    When was the last time you listened to someone, or someone really listened to you?     </p>
<p>                    This life-changing book will transform your conversations forever.    </p>
<p>                     At work, we&#8217;re taught to lead the conversation.    </p>
<p>                     On social media, we shape our personal narratives.    </p>
<p>                     At parties, we talk over one another. So do our politicians.    </p>
<p>                     We&#8217;re not listening.    </p>
<p>                     And no one is listening to us.    </p>
<p>                    Now more than ever, we need to listen to those around us. New York Times contributor Kate Murphy draws on countless conversations she has had with everyone from priests to CIA interrogators, focus group moderators to bartenders, her great-great aunt to her friend&#8217;s toddler, to show how only by listening well can we truly connect with others.    </p>
<p>                     Listening has the potential to transform our relationships and our working lives, improve our self-knowledge, and increase our creativity and happiness. While it may take some effort, it&#8217;s a skill that can be learnt and perfected.    </p>
<p>                     When all we crave is to understand and be understood, You&#8217;re Not Listening shows us how.    </p>
<p>                    * With a new afterword by the author *    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This book couldn&#8217;t be more timely. Inspiringly profound&#8230;smart and playful&#8217; Observer    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People are now exposed to more information than ever before, provided both by technology and by increasing access to every level of education. These societal gains, however, have also helped fuel a surge in narcissistic and misguided intellectual egalitarianism that has crippled informed debates on any number of issues. Today, everyone knows everything: with only a quick trip through WebMD or Wikipedia, average citizens believe themselves to be on an equal<br />
                    intellectual footing with doctors and diplomats. All voices, even the most ridiculous, demand to be taken with equal seriousness, and any claim to the contrary is dismissed as undemocratic elitism.    </p>
<p>                    As Tom Nichols shows in The Death of Expertise, this rejection of experts has occurred for many reasons, including the openness of the internet, the emergence of a customer satisfaction model in higher education, and the transformation of the news industry into a 24-hour entertainment machine. Paradoxically, the increasingly democratic dissemination of information, rather than producing an educated public, has instead created an army of ill-informed and angry citizens who denounce<br />
                    intellectual achievement.    </p>
<p>                    Nichols has deeper concerns than the current rejection of expertise and learning, noting that when ordinary citizens believe that no one knows more than anyone else, democratic institutions themselves are in danger of falling either to populism or to technocracy-or in the worst case, a combination of both. The Death of Expertise is not only an exploration of a dangerous phenomenon but also a warning about the stability and survival of modern democracy in the Information<br />
                    Age.</p>

I&#8217;m Judging You is her debut book of humorous essays that dissects our cultural obsessions and calls out bad behavior in our increasingly digital, connected lives-from the cultural importance of the newest Shonda Rhimes television drama to serious discussions of race and media representation to what to do about your fool cousin sharing casket pictures from Grandma&#8217;s wake on Facebook. With a lighthearted, rapier wit and a unique perspective, I&#8217;m Judging You is the handbook the world needs, doling out the hard truths and a road map for bringing some &#8220;act right&#8221; into our lives, social media, and popular culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years after the sexual revolution, we are told that we live in a time of unprecedented sexual freedom; that if anything, we are too free now. But beneath the veneer of glossy hedonism, millennial journalist Rachel Hills argues that we are controlled by a new brand of sexual convention: one which influences all of us-woman or man, straight or gay, liberal or conservative. At the root of this silent code lies the Sex Myth-the defining significance we invest in sexuality that once meant we were dirty if we didhave sex, and now means we are defective if we don&#8217;tdo it enough.     </p>
<p>                    Equal parts social commentary, pop culture, and powerful personal anecdotes from people across the English-speaking world, The Sex Mythexposes the invisible norms and unspoken assumptions that shape the way we think about sex today.</p>

<p>                      Britain eats more fast food than any other country in Europe. It looks good, tastes good, and it&#8217;s cheap. But the real cost never appears on the menu.    </p>
<p>                      Eric Schlosser visits the lab that re-creates the smell of strawberries; examines the safety records of abattoirs; reveals why the fries really taste so good and what lurks between the sesame buns &#8211; and shows how fast food is transforming not only our diets but our world.    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Fast Food Nation has lifted the polystyrene lid on the global fast food industry &#8230; and sparked a storm&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The word &#8220;love&#8221; is most often defined as a noun, yet&#8230;we would all love better if we used it as a verb,&#8221; writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.  As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question &#8220;What is love?&#8221; her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society&#8217;s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the &#8220;100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.&#8221; All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why are people around the world so very different? What makes us live, buy, even love as we do? The answers are in the codes. In The Culture Code, internationally revered cultural anthropologist and marketing expert Clotaire Rapaille reveals for the first time the techniques he has used to improve profitability and practices for dozens of Fortune 100 companies. His groundbreaking revelations shed light not just on business but on the way every human being acts and lives around the world. Rapaille&#8217;s breakthrough notion is that we acquire a silent system of codes as we grow up within our culture. These codes&#8211;the Culture Code&#8211;are what make us American, or German, or French, and they invisibly shape how we behave in our personal lives, even when we are completely unaware of our motives. What&#8217;s more, we can learn to crack the codes that guide our actions and achieve new understanding of why we do the things we do. Rapaille has used the Culture Code to help Chrysler build the PT Cruiser&#8211;the most successful American car launch in recent memory. He has used it to help Procter &#038; Gamble design its advertising campaign for Folger&#8217;s coffee &#8211; one of the longest lasting and most successful campaigns in the annals of advertising. He has used it to help companies as diverse as GE, AT&#038;T, Boeing, Honda, Kellogg, and L&#8217;Oréal improve their bottom line at home and overseas. And now, in The Culture Code, he uses it to reveal why Americans act distinctly like Americans, and what makes us different from the world around us. In The Culture Code, Dr. Rapaille decodes two dozen of our most fundamental archetypes&#8211;ranging from sex to money to health to America itself&#8211;to give us &#8220;a new set of glasses&#8221; with which to view our actions and motivations. Why are we so often disillusioned by love? Why is fat a solution rather than a problem? Why do we reject the notion of perfection? Why is fast food in our lives to stay? The answers are in the Codes. Understanding the Codes gives us unprecedented freedom over our lives. It lets us do business in dramatically new ways. And it finally explains why people around the world really are different, and reveals the hidden clues to understanding us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    FULLY REVISED &#038; UPDATED, WITH A NEW EPILOGUE    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Delightful.&#8221;-The Economist    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s Santa Claus, Shakespeare, Mickey Mouse, the Bible, and then there&#8217;s Star Wars. Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williams&#8217;s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.    </p>
<p>                              In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the films&#8217; wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One-of-a-kind cultural critic and New York Times bestselling author Chuck Klosterman &#8220;offers up great facts, interesting cultural insights, and thought-provoking moral calculations in this look at our love affair with the anti-hero&#8221; (New York magazine).     </p>
<p>                    Chuck Klosterman, &#8220;The Ethicist&#8221; for The New York Times Magazine, has walked into the darkness. In I Wear the Black Hat, he questions the modern understanding of villainy. When we classify someone as a bad person, what are we really saying, and why are we so obsessed with saying it? How does the culture of malevolence operate? What was so Machiavellian about Machiavelli? Why don&#8217;t we see Bernhard Goetz the same way we see Batman? Who is more worthy of our vitriol&#8211;Bill Clinton or Don Henley? What was O.J. Simpson&#8217;s second-worst decision? And why is Klosterman still haunted by some kid he knew for one week in 1985?     </p>
<p>                    Masterfully blending cultural analysis with self-interrogation and imaginative hypotheticals, I Wear the Black Hat delivers perceptive observations on the complexity of the antihero (seemingly the only kind of hero America still creates). As the Los Angeles Times notes: &#8220;By underscoring the contradictory, often knee-jerk ways we encounter the heroes and villains of our culture, Klosterman illustrates the passionate but incomplete computations that have come to define American culture&#8211;and maybe even American morality.&#8221; I Wear the Black Hat is a rare example of serious criticism that&#8217;s instantly accessible and really, really funny.</p>

We created technologies that would help connect us faster, gather news, map the planet, and compile knowledge. We strove for an instantaneous network where time and space could be compressed. Well, the future&#8217;s arrived. We live in a continuous now enabled by Twitter, email, and a so-called real-time technological shift. Yet this now is an elusive goal that we can never quite reach. And the dissonance between our digital selves and our analog bodies has thrown us into a new state of anxiety: present shock.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gripping read&#8217; Adam Grant, bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    Reddit hails itself as &#8216;the front page of the Internet&#8217;. It&#8217;s the sixth most-visited website in the world &#8211; and yet, millions have no idea what it is. They should be paying attention.    </p>
<p>                    This definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit is perfect for readers of The Everything Store, Googled and The Facebook Effect.    </p>
<p>                    We Are the Nerds takes readers inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving crimes and spurring millions in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and even landing Donald Trump in the White House. Reddit has become a mirror of the Internet itself: It has dark trenches, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a heart-warming ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.    </p>
<p>                    This is the gripping story of how Reddit&#8217;s founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, transformed themselves from student video-gamers into Silicon Valley millionaires as they turned their creation into an icon of the digital age. But the journey was often fraught. Reporting on Reddit for more than six years, conducting hundreds of interviews and gaining exclusive access to its founders, Christine Lagorio-Chafkin has written the definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit. Packed with revelatory details about its biggest triumphs and controversies, this inside look at Reddit includes fresh insights on the relationship between Huffman and Ohanian, staff turmoil, the tragic life of Aaron Swartz, and Reddit&#8217;s struggle to become profitable.    </p>
<p>                    In a time when we are increasingly concerned about privacy and manipulation on social platforms, We Are the Nerds reveals Reddit&#8217;s central role in the dissemination of culture and information in history&#8217;s first fully digital century. Rigorously reported and highly entertaining, We Are the Nerds explores how this unique platform has changed the way we all communicate today.    </p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Incisive, witty and brilliantly written&#8217; &#8211; Emily Chang, bestselling author of Brotopia    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A triumph &#8211; a business book that reads like a page-turning novel&#8217; &#8211; James Ledbetter, author of One Nation Under Gold    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The best, grittiest, most accurate book yet about what it&#8217;s like to build a startup and a community from scratch&#8217; &#8211; John Zeratsky, bestselling author of Sprint and Make Time    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A gripping, entertaining book that is a must-read for every entrepreneur&#8217; &#8211; Daymond John, bestselling author of Rise and Grind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Too many books on tech feel like they have been Googled together; Lagorio-Chafkin&#8217;s is rich in original reportage&#8217; &#8211; TLS</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A fascinating survey of the digital age . . . An eye-opening paean to possibility.&#8221; &#8211;The Boston Globe &#8220;Mr. Shirky writes cleanly and convincingly about the intersection of technological innovation and social change.&#8221; &#8211;New York Observer An extraordinary exploration of how technology can empower social and political organizers For the first time in history, the tools for cooperating on a global scale are not solely in the hands of governments or institutions. The spread of the internet and mobile phones are changing how people come together and get things done&#8211;and sparking a revolution that, as Clay Shirky shows, is changing what we do, how we do it, and even who we are. Here, we encounter a whoman who loses her phone and recruits an army of volunteers to get it back from the person who stole it. A dissatisfied airline passenger who spawns a national movement by taking her case to the web. And a handful of kids in Belarus who create a political protest that the state is powerless to stop. Here Comes Everybody is a revelatory examination of how the wildfirelike spread of new forms of social interaction enabled by technology is changing the way humans form groups and exist within them. A revolution in social organization has commenced, and Clay Shirky is its brilliant chronicler.</p>

<p>                    *TIME Top 10 non-fiction books of 2016*    </p>
<p>                    *Amazon Best Non-fiction of 2016*    </p>
<p>                    A generation gap has emerged between parents and their daughters. Mothers and fathers have little idea about the pressures and expectations they face or how they feel about them.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Does anyone date anymore?&#8221; Today, the authorities tell us that courtship is in crisis. But when Moira Weigel dives into the history of sex and romance in modern America, she discovers that authorities have always said this. Ever since young men and women started to go out together, older generations have scolded them: That&#8217;s not the way to find true love. The first women who made dates with strangers were often arrested for prostitution; long before &#8220;hookup culture,&#8221; there were &#8220;petting parties&#8221;; before parents worried about cell phone apps, they fretted about joyrides and &#8220;parking.&#8221; Dating is always dying. But this does not mean that love is dead. It simply changes with the economy. Dating is, and always has been, tied to work.     </p>
<p>                    Lines like &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick you up at six&#8221; made sense at a time when people had jobs that started and ended at fixed hours. But in an age of contract work and flextime, many of us have become sexual freelancers, more likely to text a partner &#8220;u still up?&#8221; Weaving together over one hundred years of history with scenes from the contemporary landscape, Labor of Love offers a fresh feminist perspective on how we came to date the ways we do. This isn&#8217;t a guide to &#8220;getting the guy.&#8221; There are no ridiculous &#8220;rules&#8221; to follow. Instead, Weigel helps us understand how looking for love shapes who we are&#8211;and hopefully leads us closer to the happy ending that dating promises.</p>

<p>                    Odds are that as you read this, an iPhone is within reach. But before Steve Jobs introduced us to &#8216;the one device&#8217;, as he called it, a mobile phone was merely what you used to make calls on the go.    </p>
<p>                    How did the iPhone transform our world and turn Apple into the most valuable company ever? Veteran technology journalist Brian Merchant reveals the inside story you won&#8217;t hear from Cupertino &#8211; based on his exclusive interviews with the engineers, inventors and developers who guided every stage of the iPhone&#8217;s creation.    </p>
<p>                    This deep dive takes you from inside 1 Infinite Loop to nineteenth-century France to WWII America, from the driest place on earth to a Kenyan pit of toxic e-waste, and even deep inside Shenzhen&#8217;s notorious &#8216;suicide factories&#8217;. It&#8217;s a first-hand look at how the cutting-edge tech that makes the world work &#8211; touch screens, motion trackers and even AI &#8211; made its way into our pockets.    </p>
<p>                    The One Device is a road map for design and engineering genius, an anthropology of the modern age and an unprecedented view into one of the most secretive companies in history. This is the untold account, ten years in the making, of the device that changed everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>
