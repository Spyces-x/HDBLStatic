										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE ONE WHERE GREG GETS &#8220;THE TALK&#8221;</p>
<p>                     The fifth laugh-out-loud, fully-illustrated Diary of a Wimpy Kid book from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinney! A global phenomenon with 250 million copies of the series sold worldwide!</p>
<p>                    Greg Heffley has always been in a hurry to grow up. Being older means you can live alone, eat whatever you want for dinner and don&#8217;t have to share with your brothers. PERFECT.</p>
<p>                    At least, that&#8217;s what Greg thought, but it turns out there&#8217;s a lot more to growing up like dealing with boy/girl dances, increased responsibilities and awkward changes.</p>
<p>                    On top of all this, he&#8217;s fighting with this best friend Rowley, and is being dragged to his uncle&#8217;s FIFTH wedding. Surely there&#8217;s more to growing up than THIS?</p>

<p>                     Along with his friend Rowley, Greg&#8217;s desperate to prove his new maturity, which only going up a grade can bring. But when Rowley&#8217;s star starts to rise, will Greg be able to reach the same heights of popularity as his best friend? </p>

<p>                    The pressure&#8217;s really piling up on Greg Heffley. His mum thinks video games are turning his brain to mush, so she wants her son to put down the controller and explore his &#8220;creative side&#8221;.</p>

<p>                    But then Greg has an idea. Maybe he can get his mom off his back by making a movie . . . and even become rich and famous in the process? Or will doubling down on this plan just double Greg&#8217;s troubles?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gorgeously written and oh-so-deeply felt &#8211; Nicola Yoon, author of Everything Everything and The Sun is Also a Star    </p>
<p>                    From the author of the New York Times bestseller All the Bright Places comes a heart-wrenching story about what it means to see (and love) someone for who they truly are.    </p>
<p>                     Everyone thinks they know Libby Strout.<br />
                    I know the part I want to play here at MVB High. I want to be the girl who can do anything.    </p>
<p>                    Once dubed &#8216;America&#8217;s Fattest Teen&#8217;, she is only seen for her weight. Not the girl underneath.    </p>
<p>                    Since her mum&#8217;s death she&#8217;s been picking up the pieces in private, alone with her heartbroken father.    </p>
<p>                    But now, Libby is ready. She&#8217;s ready for high school, for new friends, for love and for every possibility life has to offer.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone thinks they know Jack Masselin too.<br />
                    Be charming. Be hilarious. Don&#8217;t get too close to anyone.    </p>
<p>                    Yes, he&#8217;s got swagger, but he&#8217;s also mastered the art of fitting in.    </p>
<p>                    What no one knows is that Jack has a secret: he can&#8217;t recognize faces. Even his own brothers are strangers to him.    </p>
<p>                    He&#8217;s the guy who can re-engineer and rebuild anything, but he can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on with the inner workings of his own brain.     </p>
<p>                     When Jack and Libby meet, they discover that the more time they spend together, the less alone they feel.</p>
