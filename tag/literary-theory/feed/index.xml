										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is the fiery, provocative, and unparalleled work of feminist art criticism that launched Camille Paglia&#8217;s exceptional career as one of our most important public intellectuals. Is Emily Dickinson &#8220;the female Sade&#8221;? Is Donatello&#8217;s David a bit of pedophile pornography? What is the secret kinship between Byron and Elvis Presley, between Medusa and Madonna? How do liberals and feminists&#8211;as well as conservatives&#8211;fatally misread human nature? This audacious and omnivorously learned work of guerrilla scholarship offers nothing less than a unified-field theory of Western culture, high and low, since Egyptians invented beauty&#8211;making a persuasive case for all art as a pagan battleground between male and female, form and chaos, civilization and daemonic nature.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new book by America&#8217;s leading literary critic on the uses of deep reading. Practical, inspirational and learned, How to Read and Why is Bloom&#8217;s manifesto for the preponderance of written culture.    </p>
<p>                              In the vastly influential The Western Canon, Harold Bloom outlined what we should read to understand a greater depth of the individual self. How to Read and Why continues the argument and focusses on how we use literature in order to gain deeper self-awareness. Poems, stories, novels, plays and parables are all analysed as forms of writing as immersion, the language of individuality and inwardness: Shakespeare&#8217;s sonnets, the short stories of Hemingway and de Cervantes, the novels of Proust and Calvino, Sophocles&#8217;s Oedipus Rex and Mark&#8217;s Gospel. Harold Bloom also addresses the idea of why we read: increased individuality, respite from visual bombardment, a return to &#8216;deep feeling&#8217; and &#8216;deep thinking&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                              How to Read and Why is an essential book for any reader, an introduction to the world of written culture, an inspirational self-help book for students and teachers alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A personal and powerful essay from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the bestselling author of Americanah and Half of a Yellow Sun.    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;I would like to ask that we begin to dream about and plan for a different world. A fairer world. A world of happier men and happier women who are truer to themselves. And this is how to start: we must raise our daughters differently. We must also raise our sons differently&#8230;&#8217;    </p>
<p>                              What does &#8220;feminism&#8221; mean today?    </p>
<p>                              In this personal, eloquently argued essay &#8211; adapted from her much-admired Tedx talk of the same name &#8211; Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie offers readers a unique definition of feminism for the twenty-first century, one rooted in inclusion and awareness. Drawing extensively on her own experiences and her deep understanding of the often masked realities of sexual politics, here is one remarkable author&#8217;s exploration of what it means to be a woman now &#8211; an of-the-moment rallying cry for why we should all be feminists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Have Or to Be? is one of the seminal books of the second half of the 20th century. Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With half a million copies in print, How to Read a Book is the best and most successful guide to reading comprehension for the general reader, completely rewritten and updated with new material.<br />
                         Originally published in 1940, this book is a rare phenomenon, a living classic that introduces and elucidates the various levels of reading and how to achieve them-from elementary reading, through systematic skimming and inspectional reading, to speed reading. Readers will learn when and how to &#8220;judge a book by its cover,&#8221; and also how to X-ray it, read critically, and extract the author&#8217;s message from the text.<br />
                         Also included is instruction in the different techniques that work best for reading particular genres, such as practical books, imaginative literature, plays, poetry, history, science and mathematics, philosophy and social science works.<br />
                         Finally, the authors offer a recommended reading list and supply reading tests you can use measure your own progress in reading skills, comprehension, and speed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few could explain, let alone seek out, a career in criticism. Yet what A. O. Scott shows in Better Living Through Criticism is that we are, in fact, all critics: because critical thinking informs almost every aspect of artistic creation, of civil action, of interpersonal life. With penetrating insight and humour, Scott shows that while individual critics &#8211; himself included &#8211; can make mistakes and find flaws where they shouldn&#8217;t, criticism as a discipline is one of the noblest, most creative and urgent activities.    </p>
<p>                    Using his own film criticism as a starting point &#8211; everything from an infamous dismissal of the international blockbuster The Avengers to his intense affection for Pixar&#8217;s animated Ratatouille &#8211; Scott expands outwards, easily guiding readers through the complexities of Rilke and Shelley, the origins of Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, the power of Marina Abramovic and &#8216;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#8217; Scott shows that real criticism was and always will be the breath of fresh air that allows true creativity to thrive. As he puts it: &#8216;The time for criticism is always now, because the imperative to think clearly, never goes away.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not exercising as much as you should? Counting your calories in your sleep? Feeling ashamed for not being happier? You may be a victim of the wellness syndrome. In this ground-breaking new book, Carl Cederstrom and Andre Spicer argue that the ever-present pressure to maximize our wellness has started to work against us, making us feel worse and provoking us to withdraw into ourselves. The Wellness Syndrome follows health freaks who go to extremes to find the perfect diet, corporate athletes who start the day with a dance party, and the self-trackers who monitor everything, including their own toilet habits. This is a world where feeling good has become indistinguishable from being good. Visions of social change have been reduced to dreams of individual transformation, political debate has been replaced by insipid moralising, and scientific evidence has been traded for new-age delusions. A lively and humorous diagnosis of the cult of wellness, this book is an indispensable guide for everyone suspicious of our relentless quest to be happier and healthier.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;What if the success of E.L.James and Dan Brown was not so random? What  if there were an algorithm that could pick out the bestseller DNA  concealed within these books before they&#8217;re published? This is the  audacious claim made by Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers &#8230; Smart,  savvy and full of ideas&#8217; Fiona Wilson, The Times    </p>
<p>                    Girl on the Train. Fifty Shades. The Goldfinch. Why do some books capture the whole world&#8217;s attention? In The Bestseller Code, Archer and Jockers boldly claim that not only can mega-hits be explained and identified &#8211; but they&#8217;ve built the algorithm to prove it. Using cutting-edge text mining techniques, they have developed a model that analyses theme, plot, style and character  to explain why some books resonate more than others with readers. Provocative, entertaining, and ground-breaking, The Bestseller Code explores the hidden patterns at work in the biggest hits and, more importantly, the real reasons we love to read.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Non-formulaic, eye-opening, deeply-researched &#8211; and really worth your time&#8217; GQ    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;When a story captures the imagination of millions, that&#8217;s magic. Can  you qualify magic? Archer and Jockers just may have done so&#8217; Sylvia Day,  no.1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The claims are eye-grabbing . . . and also highly plausible&#8217; Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, Spectator    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thought-provoking and interesting &#8230; Here is a book worth reading&#8217; David Bond, Financial Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thoroughly revised and updated edition of Thomas C. Foster&#8217;s classic guide-a lively and entertaining introduction to literature and literary basics, including symbols, themes and contexts, that shows you how to make your everyday reading experience more rewarding and enjoyable.  While many books can be enjoyed for their basic stories, there are often deeper literary meanings interwoven in these texts. How to Read Literature Like a Professor helps us to discover those hidden truths by looking at literature with the eyes-and the literary codes-of the ultimate professional reader, the college professor.  What does it mean when a literary hero is traveling along a dusty road? When he hands a drink to his companion? When he&#8217;s drenched in a sudden rain shower?  Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices and form, Thomas C. Foster provides us with a broad overview of literature-a world where a road leads to a quest, a shared meal may signify a communion, and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just a shower-and shows us how to make our reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.<br />
                    This revised edition includes new chapters, a new preface and epilogue, and incorporates updated teaching points that Foster has developed over the past decade.</p>
