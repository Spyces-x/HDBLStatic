										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When love means saying goodbye&#8230;</p>
<p>                    After a career ending sports injury, Logan Carswell retreats to a small Wyoming town to heal mind and body. But his short-term solution hits a snag when he meets sexy bartender Caro Davis. She&#8217;s everything he&#8217;s ever wanted. A generous lover. A loyal friend. But she&#8217;s firmly planted in a place he&#8217;ll never call home.</p>
<p>                    Tending bar at the Spirits and Spurs suits Caro just fine. She&#8217;s a small-town girl who isn&#8217;t about to leave Shoshone or her ailing grandmother. Not even for the kindest, hottest man she&#8217;s ever met. He&#8217;s ditched his big-city clothes for cowboy duds, but the change is temporary. And every moment they share brings her closer to heartbreak&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Detective Isaac Bell travels the early-twentieth-century American railways, driven by a sense of justice and a determination to stop a new mastermind reigning terror on a crucial express line in this #1 New York Times-bestselling series.    </p>
<p>                     A year of financial panic and labor unrest, 1907 sees train wrecks, fires, and explosions sabotage the Southern Pacific Railroad&#8217;s Cascades express line. Desperate for help the railroad hires the fabled Van Dorn Detective Agency. Van Dorn&#8217;s best man, Isaac Bell, quickly discovers a mysterious saboteur haunting the hobo jungles of the West. Known only as the Wrecker, he recruits vulnerable accomplices from the down-and-out to attack the railroad, and then kills them afterward. The Wrecker traverses the vast spaces of the American West as if he had wings, striking wherever he pleases, causing untold damage and loss of human life. Who is he? What does he want? Is he a striker? An anarchist? A revolutionary determined to displace the &#8220;privileged few&#8221;? A criminal mastermind engineering some as yet unexplained scheme?    </p>
<p>                     Whoever he is, whatever his motives, the Wrecker knows how to create maximum havoc, and Bell senses that he is far from done-that, in fact, the Wrecker is building up to a grand act unlike anything he has committed before. If Bell doesn&#8217;t stop him in time, more than a railroad could be at risk-it could be the future of the entire country.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>His life is chaos and confusion. It&#8217;s a storm of uncertainty and raging emotion. Sutton Warner is a mess. Everything in his life feels like it&#8217;s unraveling. He&#8217;s let a lot of people down lately, including his daughter. Sutton always promised his little girl he would never disappoint her and that he would always be there when she needed him. Until he wasn&#8217;t. The truth is, he&#8217;s used to disappointing the women in his life. First was his mother who couldn&#8217;t find a reason to stick around when he was growing up. Then there&#8217;s his ex. The woman who takes unbridled delight in making his life incredibly complicated. Luckily, his daughter is still young enough to believe her old man is some kind of hero. But he knows the day is coming when she realizes the truth, that he&#8217;s just a man with some serious flaws and a list of ever-growing weaknesses. Finally, there&#8217;s the woman he&#8217;s desperately trying to forget with every shot tossed back and each pill popped. He more than disappointed Emrys&#8230;. He almost got her killed. Her love is steady and sure. It&#8217;s a shelter shaped by conviction and silent assurance.     </p>
<p>                    Emrys Santos is lost. Everything in her life feels pointless and futile. She&#8217;s been busy running away from her feelings and all the people who love her the most &#8211; including her best friend, the one person who knows exactly what she&#8217;s been through. They promised to always stick together and to lean on one another. It was a promise Em had to break so she could lick her wounds and figure out her next move. For once, there is no easy way out of the tangled web of emotions she&#8217;s caught up in, and right now, she recognizes that all roads lead back to Wyoming&#8230;and back to Sutton. The man she nearly got killed.     </p>
<p>                    Shelter is a standalone novel, the second book in the Getaway series, which features the hardheaded and brokenhearted Warner brothers and the women who dare to love them. These boys are very good at putting the wild in wilderness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FOR THE JENSEN FAMILY, DANGER IS MERELY ANOTHER HOLIDAY TRADITION.  At the Sugarloaf Ranch, Smoke and Sally Jensen prepare to welcome Preacher home for the holidays&#8211;unaware that their friend is trailed by a storm full of trouble.  On a mission of vengeance, an old trapper is rescued by Ace and Chance Jensen from ruthless outlaws&#8211;and wanted by a driven bounty hunter named Luke Jensen.  And, just released from prison, a criminal mastermind assembles a vicious gang of cutthroats to extract his final revenge against his enemy&#8211;the sheriff of Big Rock, Colorado . . .  With a snowstorm brewing, a community in jeopardy, and a showdown ready to explode, these courageous pioneers are brought together by fate and fury to forge peace on earth. But they&#8217;re going to have to fight for it. With guns. With grit. With glory. Because this Christmas, the greatest gift of all is . . . staying alive.
