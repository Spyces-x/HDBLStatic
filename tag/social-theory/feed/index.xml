										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLER**</p>
<p>                    In twenty-one bite-sized lessons, Yuval Noah Harari explores what it means to be human in an age of bewilderment. </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                              &#8217;21 Lessons is, simply put, a crucial book&#8217; Adam Kay</p>
<p>                    How can we protect ourselves from nuclear war, ecological cataclysms and technological disruptions? What can we do about the epidemic of fake news or the threat of terrorism? What should we teach our children? </p>
<p>                    Yuval Noah Harari takes us on a thrilling journey through today&#8217;s most urgent issues. The golden thread running through his exhilarating new book is the challenge of maintaining our collective and individual focus in the face of constant and disorienting change.</p>
<p>                    Are we still capable of understanding the world we have created?</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating&#8230; compelling&#8230; [Harari] has teed up a crucial global conversation about how to take on the problems of the 21st century&#8217; Bill Gates, New York Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Truly mind-expanding&#8230; Ultra-topical&#8217; Guardian</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a renowned American anthropologist comes a proud celebration of human capacities. For too long, people have taken their own ways of life for granted, ignoring the vast, international cultural community that srrounds them. Humankind must now embark on the difficult journey beyond culture, to the discovery of a lost self a sense of perspective. By holding up a mirror, Hall permits us to see the awesome grip of unconscious culture. With concrete examples ranging from James Joyce&#8217;s Finnegans Wake to the mating habits of the bowerbird of New Guinea, Hall shows us ourselves. Beyond Culture is a book about self-discovery; it is a voyage we all must embark on if mankind is to survive.     </p>
<p>                    Fascinating and emotionally challenging. . . . The book&#8217;s graceful, non-technical style and the many illuminating, real-life illustrations make it a delight to read. &#8211;Library Journal    </p>
<p>                    Hall&#8217;s book helps us to rethink our values. . . . We come away from it exhilarated. &#8211;Ashley Montagu     </p>
<p>                    In this penetrating analysis of the culturally determined yet &#8216;unconscious&#8217; attitudes that mold our thought, feeling, communication and behavior. . . . Hall makes explicit taken-for-granted linguistic patterns, body rhythms, personality dynamics, educational goals. . . . Many of Hall&#8217;s ideas are original and incisive . . . [and] should reward careful readers with new ways of thinking about themselves and others. &#8211;Publishers Weekly    </p>
<p>                    A fascintaing book which stands beside The Hidden Dimension and The Silent Language to prove Hall one of the most original anthropologists of our era. &#8211;Paul Bohannan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Excellent.&#8221;&#8211;The Wall Street Journal     </p>
<p>                    Since its publication ten years ago, businesspeople, investors, doctors, parents, students, athletes, and musicians at every level have adopted the maxims of Talent Is Overrated to get better at what they&#8217;re passionate about. Now this classic has been updated and revised with new research and takeaways to help anyone achieve even greater performance.     </p>
<p>                     Why are certain people so incredibly great at what they do? Most of us think we know the answer&#8211;but we&#8217;re almost always wrong. That&#8217;s important, because if we&#8217;re wrong on this crucial question, then we have zero chance of getting significantly better at anything we care about.<br />
                     Happily, the real source of great performance is no longer a mystery. Bringing together extensive scientific research, bestselling author Geoff Colvin shows where we go wrong and what actually makes world-class performers so remarkable. It isn&#8217;t specific, innate talent, nor is it plain old hard work. It&#8217;s a very specific type of work that anyone can do&#8211;but most people don&#8217;t.<br />
                     What&#8217;s more, the principles of great performance apply to virtually any activity that matters to you. Readers worldwide have been inspired by this book&#8217;s liberating message: You don&#8217;t need a one-in-a-million natural gift. Better performance, and maybe even world-class performance, is closer than you think.</p>

<p>                    NOT BEING RACIST IS NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE TO BE ANTIRACIST.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Transformative and revolutionary&#8217; ROBIN DIANGELO, author of White Fragility    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;So vital&#8217; IJEOMA OLUO, author of So You Want to Talk About Race    </p>
<p>                     In this rousing and deeply empathetic book, Ibram X. Kendi, one of the world&#8217;s most influential scholars of racism, shows that neutrality is not an option: until we become part of the solution, we can only be part of the problem.    </p>
<p>                     Using his extraordinary gifts as a teacher and story-teller, Kendi helps us recognise that everyone is, at times, complicit in racism whether they realise it or not, and by describing with moving humility his own journey from racism to antiracism, he shows us how instead to be a force for good. Along the way, Kendi punctures all the myths and taboos that so often cloud our understanding, from arguments about what race is and whether racial differences exist to the complications that arise when race intersects with ethnicity, class, gender and sexuality.    </p>
<p>                     In the process he demolishes the myth of the post-racial society and builds from the ground up a vital new understanding of racism &#8211; what it is, where it is hidden, how to identify it and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The most courageous book to date on the problem of race&#8217; New York Times    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DEBUTED AT NO.1 ON THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER LIST<br />
                    NO.1 BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF THE SOCIAL ANIMAL    </p>
<p>                    Are you on your first or second mountain?<br />
                    Is life about you &#8211; or others?<br />
                    About success &#8211; or something deeper?     </p>
<p>                    The  world tells us that we should pursue our self-interest: career wins,  high status, nice things. These are the goals of our first mountain. But  at some point in our lives we might find that we&#8217;re not interested in  what other people tell us to want. We want the things that are truly  worth wanting.    </p>
<p>                    This is the second mountain.     </p>
<p>                    What does it  mean to look beyond yourself and find a moral cause? To forget about  independence and discover dependence &#8211; to be utterly enmeshed in a web  of warm relationships? What does it mean to value intimacy, devotion,  responsibility and commitment above individual freedom? In The Second Mountain  David Brooks explores the meaning and possibilities that scaling a  second mountain offer us and the four commitments that most commonly  move us there: family, vocation, philosophy and community. Inspiring,  personal and full of joy, this book will help you discover why you were  really put on this earth.</p>

In large part this is because the topic feels racially charged. The irony is that the facts actually debunk racial stereotypes. There are black and Hispanic subgroups in the United States far outperforming many white and Asian subgroups. Moreover, there&#8217;s a demonstrable arc to group success-in immigrant groups, it typically dissipates by the third generation-puncturing the notion of innate group differences and undermining the whole concept of &#8216;model minorities.'&#8221;    </p>
<p>                     Mormons have recently risen to astonishing business success. Cubans in Miami climbed from poverty to prosperity in a generation. Nigerians earn doctorates at stunningly high rates. Indian and Chinese Americans have much higher incomes than other Americans; Jews may have the highest of all.    </p>
<p>                     Why do some groups rise? Drawing on groundbreaking original research and startling statistics, The Triple Package uncovers the secret to their success. A superiority complex, insecurity, impulse control-these are the elements of the Triple Package, the rare and potent cultural constellation that drives disproportionate group success. The Triple Package is open to anyone. America itself was once a Triple Package culture. It&#8217;s been losing that edge for a long time now. Even as headlines proclaim the death of upward mobility in America, the truth is that the old-fashioned American Dream is very much alive-but some groups have a cultural edge, which enables them to take advantage of opportunity far more than others.    </p>
<p>                    *   Americans are taught that everyone is equal, that no group is superior to another. But remarkably, all of America&#8217;s most successful groups believe (even if they don&#8217;t say so aloud) that they&#8217;re exceptional, chosen, superior in some way.    </p>
<p>                    *   Americans are taught that self-esteem-feeling good about yourself-is the key to a successful life. But in all of America&#8217;s most successful groups, people tend to feel insecure, inadequate, that they have to prove themselves.    </p>
<p>                    *   America today spreads a message of immediate gratification, living for the moment. But all of America&#8217;s most successful groups cultivate heightened discipline and impulse control.    </p>
<p>                    But the Triple Package has a dark underside too. Each of its elements carries distinctive pathologies; when taken to an extreme, they can have truly toxic effects. Should people strive for the Triple Package? Should America? Ultimately, the authors conclude that the Triple Package is a ladder that should be climbed and then kicked away, drawing on its power but breaking free from its constraints.    </p>
<p>                     Provocative and profound, The Triple Package will transform the way we think about success and achievement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Its theme is political fanaticism, with which it deals severely and brilliantly.&#8221;   -New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    The famous bestseller with &#8220;concise insight into what drives the mind of the fanatic and the dynamics of a mass movement&#8221; (Wall St. Journal) by the legendary San Francisco longshoreman.    </p>
<p>                    A stevedore on the San Francisco docks in the 1940s, Eric Hoffer wrote philosophical treatises in his spare time while living in the railroad yards. The True Believer-the first and most famous of his books-was made into a bestseller when President Eisenhower cited it during one of the earliest television press conferences.    </p>
<p>                    Called a &#8220;brilliant and original inquiry&#8221; and &#8220;a genuine contribution to our social thought&#8221; by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., this landmark in the field of social psychology is completely relevant and essential for understanding the world today as it delivers a visionary, highly provocative look into the mind of the fanatic and a penetrating study of how an individual becomes one.    </p>
<p>                    In times of crisis, the great works of philosophy help us make sense of the world. This book is part of the Harper Perennial Resistance Library, a special five-book series highlighting short classic works of independent thought that illuminate the nature of truth, humanity&#8217;s dangerous attraction to authoritarianism, the influence of media and mass communication, and the philosophy of resistance-all critical in understanding today&#8217;s politically charged world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Why Information Grows, rising star Cesar Hidalgo offers a radical interpretation of global economics    </p>
<p>                    What is economic growth? And why, historically, has it occurred in only a few places? Previous efforts to answer these questions have focused on institutions, geography, finances, and psychology. But MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo argues that in order to fully grasp the nature of economic growth we need to transcend the social sciences and turn to the science of information, networks and complexity. The growth of economies, he explains, is deeply connected with the growth of order &#8211; or information.    </p>
<p>                    At first glance, the universe seems hostile to order. Thermodynamics dictates that over time, order will disappear. But thermodynamics also has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. Our cities are such pockets where information grows, but they are not all the same. For every Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and London, there are dozens of places with underdeveloped economies. Why does the US economy outstrip Brazil&#8217;s, and Brazil&#8217;s that of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston&#8217;s Route 128 languish while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case, the key is how people, companies, and the networks they form process information &#8211; it is all about their knowledge, knowhow and imagination. As Hidalgo compellingly shows, economies are made of networks of people and society is a collective computer. The problem of economic development is in fact the problem of making these networks more powerful.    </p>
<p>                    A radical new interpretation of global economics, Why Information Grows overturns traditional assumptions about the development of economies and the origins of wealth and takes a crucial step toward making economics less the dismal science and more the insightful one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Southern Theory Raewyn Connell presents the case for a new &#8216;world social science&#8217; &#8211; one that is inclusive of many voices &#8211; by arguing for a more democratic global recognition of social theory from societies outside the dominant European and North American metropole. Intellectual production of the majority &#8216;southern&#8217; world does in fact include theory, though its contribution is often marginalised and intellectually discredited by the metropole. Connell shows how social theory about the modern world from peripheral societies is equal in intellectual rigour and is often of greater political relevance to our changing world. Beginning with an examination of the hidden assumptions of modern general theory, Southern Theory looks to the &#8216;southern&#8217; social experience and the theories that have emerged from Australia, Indigenous peoples, Latin America, India, Africa, Islam and other post-colonial societies, as sources of important and vital contributions to world social science.<br />
                    These myriad theories offer valuable perspectives so crucial to the application of social theory in the contemporary world, having the power to transform the influence of the metropolitan hegemony on social thought by mutual regard and interaction. Southern Theory is a major new work in social theory, drawing on anthropology, history, psychology, philosophy, economics and cultural studies, with wide-ranging implications for the social sciences in the 21st century.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For too long, scientists have focused on the dark side of our biological heritage: our capacity for aggression, cruelty, prejudice, and self-interest. But natural selection has given us a suite of beneficial social features, including our capacity for love, friendship, cooperation, and learning. Beneath all our inventions &#8212; our tools, farms, machines, cities, nations &#8212; we carry with us innate proclivities to make a good society.     </p>
<p>                    In Blueprint, Nicholas A. Christakis introduces the compelling idea that our genes affect not only our bodies and behaviors, but also the ways in which we make societies, ones that are surprisingly similar worldwide. With many vivid examples &#8212; including diverse historical and contemporary cultures, communities formed in the wake of shipwrecks, commune dwellers seeking utopia, online groups thrown together by design or involving artificially intelligent bots, and even the tender and complex social arrangements of elephants and dolphins that so resemble our own &#8212; Christakis shows that, despite a human history replete with violence, we cannot escape our social blueprint for goodness.     </p>
<p>                    In a world of increasing political and economic polarization, it&#8217;s tempting to ignore the positive role of our evolutionary past. But by exploring the ancient roots of goodness in civilization, Blueprint shows that our genes have shaped societies for our welfare and that, in a feedback loop stretching back many thousands of years, societies have shaped, and are still shaping, our genes today.</p>

<p>                    AND IT MATTERS NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book world-renowned trust expert Rachel Botsman reveals that we are at the tipping point of one of the biggest social transformations in human history. We might have lost faith in institutions and leaders, but millions of people travel in cars with total strangers, exchange digital currencies, or find themselves trusting a bot.     </p>
<p>                    We still trust: but not the way we used to.    </p>
<p>                    If we are to benefit from this radical shift, we must understand how trust is built, managed, lost and repaired in the digital age. In the first book to explain this new world, Botsman provides a definitive guide of this uncharted landscape &#8211; and explores what&#8217;s next for humanity.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brilliantly describes how the established trust framework is undergoing a radical transformation as digital technologies take root in every facet of our lives&#8217; Marc Benioff, Chairman &#038; CEO, Salesforce    </p>
