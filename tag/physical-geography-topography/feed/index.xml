										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>** Winner of Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books 2015 **    </p>
<p>                    We live in epoch-making times. The changes we humans have made in recent decades have altered our world beyond anything it has experienced in its 4.6 billion-year history. As a result, our planet is said to be crossing into the Anthropocene &#8211; the Age of Humans.     </p>
<p>                     Gaia Vince decided to travel the world at the start of this new age to see what life is really like for the people on the frontline of the planet we&#8217;ve made.  From artificial glaciers in the Himalayas to painted mountains in Peru, electrified reefs in the Maldives to garbage islands in the Caribbean, Gaia found people doing the most extraordinary things to solve the problems that we ourselves have created.    </p>
<p>                     These stories show what the Anthropocene means for all of us &#8211; and they illuminate how we might engineer Earth for our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By the beloved and wildly popular host of the PBS Kids show Dinosaur Train, here is the book every parent needs: a rousing call to connect our kids to the natural world, filled with tips and advice.    </p>
<p>                    The average North American child now spends about seven hours a day staring at screens and mere minutes engaged in unstructured play outdoors. Yet recent research indicates that experiences in nature are essential for healthy growth.     </p>
<p>                    Regular exposure to nature can help relieve stress, depression, and attention deficits. It can reduce bullying, combat obesity, and boost academic scores. Most critical of all, abundant time in natural settings seems to yield long-term benefits in kids&#8217; cognitive, emotional, and social development.     </p>
<p>                    How to Raise a Wild Child is a timely and engaging antidote, offering teachers, parents, and other caregivers the necessary tools to engender a meaningful, lasting connection between children and the natural world.     </p>
<p>                    Distilling the latest research in multiple disciplines, Sampson reveals how adults can help kids fall in love with nature&#8211;enlisting technology as an ally, taking advantage of urban nature, and instilling a sense of place along the way.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;In a time when the connection between humans and the rest of nature is most vulnerable, Scott offers parents and teachers a book of encouragement and knowledge, and to children, the priceless gift of wonder.&#8221;&#8211;Richard Louv, author of Last Child in the Woods and The Nature Principle</p>
