										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is not enough merely to espouse a noble vision, the Dalai Lama tells us &#8211; we need to move toward it. The Dalai Lama&#8217;s vision beckons us all. Every one of us can be a force for good&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama has for decades travelled the world, meeting people from all backgrounds and sharing with them his wisdom and compassion.     </p>
<p>                    In his encounters with everyone, from heads to state to inhabitants of shanty towns, he has come across similar problems: values that help the wealthy to advance beyond the poor, an environmental disregard that could lead to global catastrophe and governments in paralysis, bereft of any positive, progressive policies.    </p>
<p>                    The Dalai Lama offers here his unique vision for a global economic system, one that applies principals of fairness and which values fulfilment, focusing on what is truly urgent and why. It is a manifesto that has the potential to reshape humanity as we know it and bring hope to millions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although we are materially better off than ever before, surveys show that we are depressed and listless. In his revolutionary book, Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard shows that happiness is not just an emotion, but a skill that can be developed. Free of jargon, Happiness contains simple exercises that will train the mind to recognize and pursue happiness by concentrating on the fundamental things in life, and in doing so change the way we view the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From one of America&#8217;s most brilliant writers, a New York Times bestselling journey through psychology, philosophy, and lots of meditation to show how Buddhism holds the key to moral clarity and enduring happiness.    </p>
<p>                    At the heart of Buddhism is a simple claim: The reason we suffer-and the reason we make other people suffer-is that we don&#8217;t see the world clearly. At the heart of Buddhist meditative practice is a radical promise: We can learn to see the world, including ourselves, more clearly and so gain a deep and morally valid happiness.    </p>
<p>                     In this &#8220;sublime&#8221; (The New Yorker), pathbreaking book, Robert Wright shows how taking this promise seriously can change your life-how it can loosen the grip of anxiety, regret, and hatred, and how it can deepen your appreciation of beauty and of other people. He also shows why this transformation works, drawing on the latest in neuroscience and psychology, and armed with an acute understanding of human evolution.    </p>
<p>                     This book is the culmination of a personal journey that began with Wright&#8217;s landmark book on evolutionary psychology, The Moral Animal, and deepened as he immersed himself in meditative practice and conversed with some of the world&#8217;s most skilled meditators. The result is a story that is &#8220;provocative, informative and&#8230;deeply rewarding&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review), and as entertaining as it is illuminating. Written with the wit, clarity, and grace for which Wright is famous, Why Buddhism Is True lays the foundation for a spiritual life in a secular age and shows how, in a time of technological distraction and social division, we can save ourselves from ourselves, both as individuals and as a species.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No matter how busy you are, find quiet reflective moments in your life&#8211;and reduce your stress levels drastically&#8211;with this classic bestselling guide from a mindfulness expert. When Wherever You Go, There You Are was first published in 1994, no one could have predicted that the book would launch itself onto bestseller lists nationwide and sell over 750,000 copies to date. Ten years later, the book continues to change lives. In honor of the book&#8217;s 10th anniversary, Hyperion is proud to be releasing the book with a new afterword by the author, and to share this wonderful book with an even larger audience.</p>
