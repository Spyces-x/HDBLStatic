										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive work on the extraordinary phenomenon of out-of-body experiences, by the founder of the internationally known Monroe Institute. </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe, a Virginia businessman, began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbound by time or death. </p>
<p>                    Praise for Journeys Out of the Body </p>
<p>                    Monroe&#8217;s account of his travels, Journeys Out of the Body, jam-packed with parasitic goblins and dead humans, astral sex, scary trips into mind-boggling other dimensions, and practical tips on how to get out of your body, all told with wry humor, quickly became a cult sensation with its publication in 1971, and has been through many printings. Whatever their &#8216;real&#8217; explanation, Monroe&#8217;s trips made for splendid reading. &#8211;Michael Hutchinson, author of Megabrain </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe&#8217;s experiences are probably the most intriguing of any person&#8217;s of our time, with the possible exception of Carlos Castaneda&#8217;s. &#8211;Joseph Chilton Pierce, author of Magical Child </p>
<p>                    This book is by a person who&#8217;s clearly a sensible man and who&#8217;s trying to tell it like it is. No ego trips. Just a solid citizen who&#8217;s been &#8216;out&#8217; a thousand times now and wants to pass his experiences to others. &#8211;The Last Whole Earth Catalog</p>

<p>                    In December 1975, the Lutz family moved into their new home on suburban Long Island. George and Kathleen Lutz knew that, one year earlier, Ronald DeFeo had murdered his parents, brothers, and sisters in the house, but the property&#8211;complete with boathouse and swimming pool&#8211;and the price had been too good to pass up.     </p>
<p>                    Twenty-eight days later, the entire Lutz family fled in terror.     </p>
<p>                    This is the spellbinding, shocking true story that gripped the nation about an American dream that turned into a nightmare beyond imagining&#8211;&#8220;this book will scare the hell out of you&#8221; (Kansas City Star).    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Mornroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death.     </p>
<p>                    Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible&#8211;and reveals to us what it all means.     </p>
<p>                    Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies over the edge, beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the interstate&#8211;the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life&#8211;and of what lies beyond.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An extraordinary book . . . It will shake up your most fundamental beliefs about everyday experience, and it just might change your life.&#8217; Paul Bloom<br />
                    ___    </p>
<p>                    For the millions of people who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris&#8217;s new book is a guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.    </p>
<p>                     Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experience of contemplatives such as Jesus, Buddha and other saints and sages of history-and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.    </p>
<p>                    Waking Up is part seeker&#8217;s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris-a scientist, philosopher, and famous sceptic-could write it.<br />
                     ___    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A demanding, illusion-shattering book.&#8217; Kirkus Reviews<br />
                    &#8216;A pleasure to read.&#8217; Huffington Post</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to venture beyond daily living and experience heightened states of awareness?     </p>
<p>                    In this highly anticipated new book, integrative medicine pioneer and New York Times bestselling author Deepak Chopra states that a higher state of consciousness is available here and now, for us all. Chopra unlocks the secrets to moving beyond our present limitations of the mind to access a field of infinite possibilities and reach our full potential. How do you achieve this? By becoming metahuman.    </p>
<p>                     Drawing from the latest research on neuroscience, artificial intelligence and biometrics, Chopra offers a practical 31 day guide to help us &#8216;wake up&#8217; at the deepest level in order to liberate ourselves from the conditioning and constructs that underlie anxiety, tension and ego driven demands. Only then does your infinite potential become your personal reality.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Grasping this revolutionary idea will effectively remove the limiting belief systems and negativity that may be holding us back from achieving our maximum human potential. Highly recommended!&#8221; Dr Rudolph E. Tanzi    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Metahuman helps us harvest peak experiences so we can see our Truth and mold the universe&#8217;s chaos into a form that brings light to the world&#8217; Dr Mehmet Oz</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Watts is the perfect guide for a course correction in life, away from materialism and its empty promise (Deepak Chopra). Here he shows us how&#8211;in an age of unprecedented anxiety&#8211;we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life.    </p>
<p>                    Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not&#8211;and cannot&#8211;know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of &#8216;writing beautifully the unwritable.'&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hymn of love to the world &#8230; A journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as  it is historical, as clever as it is wise&#8217; Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love    </p>
<p>                    As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two ways of knowledge together.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, a mother, and a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings &#8211; asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass &#8211; offer us gifts and lessons, even if we&#8217;ve forgotten how to hear their voices. In a rich braid of reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The concern for the well-being of others could be the saving grace of the 21st century. Matthieu Ricard&#8217;s Altruism, an erudite, brilliantly ranging synthesis of philosophy, psychology and ages old wisdom, is a radical call to kindness, which has the potential as a new global movement to answer the biggest problems of our time: the economy in the short term, life satisfaction in the mid-term, and the environment in the long term. As the faultlines of inequality and nationalism leave us ever more divided, Ricard challenges us to be better people &#8211; and in the process, make the world a better place.</p>
