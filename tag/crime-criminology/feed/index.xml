<p>                    &#8220;It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that Behave is one of the best nonfiction books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8221; -David P. Barash, The Wall Street Journal</p>
<p>                    &#8220;It has my vote for science book of the year.&#8221; -Parul Sehgal, The New York Times</p>
<p>                    &#8220;Hands-down one of the best books I&#8217;ve read in years. I loved it.&#8221; -Dina Temple-Raston, The Washington Post</p>
<p>                    Named a Best Book of the Year by The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal </p>
<p>                    From the celebrated neurobiologist and primatologist, a landmark, genre-defining examination of human behavior, both good and bad, and an answer to the question: Why do we do the things we do?</p>
<p>                    Sapolsky&#8217;s storytelling concept is delightful but it also has a powerful intrinsic logic: he starts by looking at the factors that bear on a person&#8217;s reaction in the precise moment a behavior occurs, and then hops back in time from there, in stages, ultimately ending up at the deep history of our species and its evolutionary legacy.</p>
<p>                    And so the first category of explanation is the neurobiological one. A behavior occurs&#8211;whether an example of humans at our best, worst, or somewhere in between. What went on in a person&#8217;s brain a second before the behavior happened? Then Sapolsky pulls out to a slightly larger field of vision, a little earlier in time: What sight, sound, or smell caused the nervous system to produce that behavior? And then, what hormones acted hours to days earlier to change how responsive that individual is to the stimuli that triggered the nervous system? By now he has increased our field of vision so that we are thinking about neurobiology and the sensory world of our environment and endocrinology in trying to explain what happened.</p>
<p>                    Sapolsky keeps going: How was that behavior influenced by structural changes in the nervous system over the preceding months, by that person&#8217;s adolescence, childhood, fetal life, and then back to his or her genetic makeup? Finally, he expands the view to encompass factors larger than one individual. How did culture shape that individual&#8217;s group, what ecological factors millennia old formed that culture? And on and on, back to evolutionary factors millions of years old. </p>
<p>                    The result is one of the most dazzling tours d&#8217;horizon of the science of human behavior ever attempted, a majestic synthesis that harvests cutting-edge research across a range of disciplines to provide a subtle and nuanced perspective on why we ultimately do the things we do&#8230;for good and for ill. Sapolsky builds on this understanding to wrestle with some of our deepest and thorniest questions relating to tribalism and xenophobia, hierarchy and competition, morality and free will, and war and peace. Wise, humane, often very funny, Behave is a towering achievement, powerfully humanizing, and downright heroic in its own right.</p>

                    &#8216;A powerful contribution to an urgent debate&#8217; GUARDIAN    </p>
<p>                    What if everything we&#8217;ve been told about addiction is wrong? One of Johann Hari&#8217;s earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of his relatives and not being able to. As he grew older, he realised there was addiction in his family. Confused, he set out on a three-year, thirty-thousand mile journey to discover what really causes addiction &#8211; and how to solve it.     </p>
<p>                    Told through a series of gripping human stories, this book was the basis of a TED talk and animation that have been viewed more than twenty million times. It has transformed the global debate about addiction.</p>

<p>                    * Future-proof yourself and your business by reading this book *     </p>
<p>                    Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flipside. Criminals are often the earliest, and most innovative, adopters of technology and modern times have led to modern crimes. Today&#8217;s criminals are stealing identities, draining online bank-accounts and wiping out computer servers.  It&#8217;s disturbingly easy to activate baby cam monitors to spy on families, pacemakers can be hacked to deliver a lethal jolt, and thieves are analyzing your social media in order to determine the best time for a home invasion.    </p>
<p>                    Meanwhile, 3D printers produce AK-47s, terrorists can download the recipe for the Ebola virus, and drug cartels are building drones. This is just the beginning of the tsunami of technological threats coming our way.  In Future Crimes, Marc Goodman rips open his database of hundreds of real cases to give us front-row access to these impending perils. Reading like a sci-fi thriller, but based in startling fact, Goodman raises tough questions about the expanding role of technology in our lives. Future Crimes is a call to action for better security measures worldwide, but most importantly, will empower readers to protect themselves against these looming technological threats &#8211; before it&#8217;s too late.</p>

<p>                    In the Robert Taylor Homes projects on Chicago&#8217;s South Side, Sudhir befriends J.T., a gang leader for the Black Kings. As he slowly gains J.T.&#8217;s trust, one day, in order to convince Sudhir of his own CEO-like qualities, J.T. makes him leader of the gang&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    Why does J.T. make his henchmen, the &#8216;shorties&#8217;, stay in school? What is the difference between a &#8216;regular&#8217; hustler and a &#8216;hype&#8217; &#8211; and is Peanut telling him the truth about which she is? And, when the FBI finally starts cracking down on the Black Kings, is it time to get out &#8211; or is it too late?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes a narcissist go from self-involved to terrifying? In this national bestseller, Joe Navarro, a leading FBI profiler, unlocks the secrets to the personality disorders that put us all at risk.      </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I should have known.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;How could we have missed the warning signs?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;I always thought there was something off about him.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    When we wake up to new tragedies in the news every day&#8211;shootings, rampages, acts of domestic terrorism&#8211;we often blame ourselves for missing the mania lurking inside unsuspecting individuals. But how could we have known that the charismatic leader had the characteristics of a tyrant? And how can ordinary people identify threats from those who are poised to devastate their lives on a daily basis&#8211;the crazy coworkers, out-of-control family members, or relentless neighbors?     </p>
<p>                    In Dangerous Personalities, former FBI profiler Joe Navarro has the answers. He shows us how to identify the four most common dangerous personalities&#8211;the Narcissist, the Predator, the Paranoid, and the Unstable Personality&#8211; and how to analyze the potential threat level. Along the way, he provides essential tips and tricks to protect ourselves both immediately and in the long-term, as well as how to heal the trauma of being exposed to the destructive egos in our world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unburdening, a witness statement and a thriller all at the same time &#8230; electrifying.&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    I have to assume that there is a very real chance that Putin or members of his regime will have me killed some day. If I&#8217;m killed, you will know who did it. When my enemies read this book, they will know that you know.    </p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times and New York Times bestseller. A true-life thriller by one of Putin&#8217;s Most Wanted.    </p>
<p>                    In November 2009, the young lawyer Sergei Magnitsky was beaten to death by eight police officers in a freezing cell in a Moscow prison. His crime? Testifying against Russian officials who were involved in a conspiracy to steal $230 million of taxes.    </p>
<p>                    Red Notice is a searing expose of the whitewash of this imprisonment and murder. The killing hasn&#8217;t been investigated. It hasn&#8217;t been punished. Bill Browder is still campaigning for justice for his late lawyer and friend. This is his explosive journey from the heady world of finance in New York and London in the 1990s, through battles with ruthless oligarchs in turbulent post-Soviet Union Moscow, to the shadowy heart of the Kremlin.    </p>
<p>                    With fraud, bribery, corruption and torture exposed at every turn, Red Notice is a shocking political roller-coaster.<br />

<p>                    Wealth and power on the trail of the super-rich    </p>
<p>                    In 2012, Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista was the eighth richest man in the world, his $30bn fortune built on Brazil&#8217;s incredible natural resources. By the middle of 2013 he had lost it all, engulfed in scandal.    </p>
<p>                    Brazillionaires is a fast-paced account of Batista&#8217;s rise and fall: a story of helicopter flights, beach-front penthouses and high-speed car crashes. Along the way, it tells the parallel story of Brazil itself, a country caught in the cycle of boom and bust, renewed hope and dashed promise; a country where the hyper-rich are at the heart of the economy &#8211; and where their wealth can buy immense political power.    </p>
<p>                    Stefan Zweig said in 1941 that Brazil was the country of the future; Brazilians joke that it always will be. Today, rampant corruption and endemic inequality threaten to derail the new Brazilian Dream. The brazillionaires are the key to understanding that dream; through them Brazillionaires tells the story of their country&#8217;s past, present and future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An &#8220;extraordinary, unforgettable&#8221; (Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow) memoir of redemption and second chances amidst America&#8217;s mass incarceration epidemic, from a member of Oprah&#8217;s SuperSoul 100     </p>
<p>                    Shaka Senghor was raised in a middle-class neighborhood on Detroit&#8217;s east side during the height of the 1980s crack epidemic. An honor roll student and a natural leader, he dreamed of becoming a doctor&#8211;but at age eleven, his parents&#8217; marriage began to unravel, and beatings from his mother worsened, which sent him on a downward spiral. He ran away from home, turned to drug dealing to survive, and ended up in prison for murder at the age of nineteen, full of anger and despair.     </p>
<p>                    Writing My Wrongs is the story of what came next. During his nineteen-year incarceration, seven of which were spent in solitary confinement, Senghor discovered literature, meditation, self-examination, and the kindness of others&#8211;tools he used to confront the demons of his past, forgive the people who hurt him, and begin atoning for the wrongs he had committed. Upon his release at age thirty-eight, Senghor became an activist and mentor to young men and women facing circumstances like his. His work in the community and the courage to share his story led him to fellowships at the MIT Media Lab and the Kellogg Foundation and invitations to speak at events like TED and the Aspen Ideas Festival.     </p>
<p>                    In equal turns, Writing My Wrongs is a page-turning portrait of life in the shadow of poverty, violence, and fear; an unforgettable story of redemption; and a compelling witness to our country&#8217;s need for rethinking its approach to crime, prison, and the men and women sent there.</p>

<p>                    From a small town in Mexico to the boardrooms of Big Pharma to main streets nationwide, an explosive and shocking account of addiction in the heartland of America.     </p>
<p>                    In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America&#8211;addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland.     </p>
<p>                    With a great reporter&#8217;s narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma&#8217;s campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive&#8211;extremely addictive&#8211;miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin&#8211;cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico&#8217;s west coast, independent of any drug cartel&#8211;assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico.     </p>
<p>                    Introducing a memorable cast of characters&#8211;pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents&#8211;Quinones shows how these tales fit together. Dreamland is a revelatory account of the corrosive threat facing America and its heartland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction    </p>
<p>                    Longlisted for the National Book Award    </p>
<p>                    One of the New York Times Book Review&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2017    </p>
<p>                    Former public defender James Forman, Jr. is a leading critic of mass incarceration and its disproportionate impact on people of colour. In LOCKING UP OWN OWN, he seeks to understand the war on crime that began in the 1970s and why it was supported by many African American leaders in the nation&#8217;s urban centres.    </p>
<p>                    Forman shows us that the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges and police chiefs took office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction. Many prominent black officials, including Washington, DC mayor Marion Barry and federal prosecutor Eric Holder, feared that the gains of the civil rights movement were being undermined by lawlessness &#8211; and thus embraced tough-on-crime measures, including longer sentences and aggressive police tactics. In the face of skyrocketing murder rates and the proliferation of open-air drug markets, they believed they had no choice. But the policies they adopted would have devastating consequences for residents of poor black neighbourhoods.    </p>
<p>                    A former public defender, Forman tells riveting stories of politicians, community activists, police officers, defendants and crime victims. He writes with compassion about individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas &#8211; from the men and women he represented in court to officials struggling to respond to a public safety emergency.LOCKING UP OWN OWN enriches our understanding of why American society became so punitive and offers important lessons to anyone concerned about the future of race and the criminal justice system.</p>

                    There is a threat lurking online. A secret war with the power to destroy your finances, steal your personal data, and endanger your life.<br />
                    In Spam Nation, investigative journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs unmasks the criminal masterminds driving some of the biggest spam and hacker operations targeting Americans and their bank accounts. Tracing the rise, fall, and alarming resurrection of the digital mafia behind the two largest spam pharmacies-and countless viruses, phishing, and spyware attacks-he delivers the first definitive narrative of the global spam problem and its threat to consumers everywhere.<br />
                    Blending cutting-edge research, investigative reporting, and firsthand interviews, this terrifying true story reveals how we unwittingly invite these digital thieves into our lives every day. From unassuming computer programmers right next door to digital mobsters like &#8220;Cosma&#8221;-who unleashed a massive malware attack that has stolen thousands of Americans&#8217; logins and passwords-Krebs uncovers the shocking lengths to which these people will go to profit from our data and our wallets.<br />
                    Not only are hundreds of thousands of Americans exposing themselves to fraud and dangerously toxic products from rogue online pharmacies, but even those who never open junk messages are at risk. As Krebs notes, spammers can-and do-hack into accounts through these emails, harvest personal information like usernames and passwords, and sell them on the digital black market. The fallout from this global epidemic doesn&#8217;t just cost consumers and companies billions, it costs lives too.<br />
                    Fast-paced and utterly gripping, Spam Nation ultimately proposes concrete solutions for protecting ourselves online and stemming this tidal wave of cybercrime-before it&#8217;s too late.<br />
                    &#8220;Krebs&#8217;s talent for exposing the weaknesses in online security has earned him respect in the IT business and loathing among cybercriminals&#8230; His track record of scoops&#8230;has helped him become the rare blogger who supports himself on the strength of his reputation for hard-nosed reporting.&#8221; -Bloomberg Businessweek</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times Bestseller<br />
                    #1 Washington Post Bestseller<br />
                    #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    On March 16, 2018, just twenty-six hours before his scheduled retirement from the organization he had served with distinction for more than two decades, Andrew G. McCabe was fired from his position as deputy director of the FBI. President Donald Trump celebrated on Twitter: &#8220;Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI &#8211; A great day for Democracy.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    In The Threat: How the FBI Protects America in the Age of Terror and Trump, Andrew G. McCabe offers a dramatic and candid account of his career, and an impassioned defense of the FBI&#8217;s agents, and of the institution&#8217;s integrity and independence in protecting America and upholding our Constitution.    </p>
<p>                    McCabe started as a street agent in the FBI&#8217;s New York field office, serving under director Louis Freeh. He became an expert in two kinds of investigations that are critical to American national security: Russian organized crime&#8211;which is inextricably linked to the Russian state&#8211;and terrorism. Under Director Robert Mueller, McCabe led the investigations of major attacks on American soil, including the Boston Marathon bombing, a plot to bomb the New York subways, and several narrowly averted bombings of aircraft. And under James Comey, McCabe was deeply involved in the controversial investigations of the Benghazi attack, the Clinton Foundation&#8217;s activities, and Hillary Clinton&#8217;s use of a private email server when she was secretary of state.    </p>
<p>                    The Threat recounts in compelling detail the time between Donald Trump&#8217;s November 2016 election and McCabe&#8217;s firing, set against a page-turning narrative spanning two decades when the FBI&#8217;s mission shifted to a new goal: preventing terrorist attacks on Americans. But as McCabe shows, right now the greatest threat to the United States comes from within, as President Trump and his administration ignore the law, attack democratic institutions, degrade human rights, and undermine the U.S. Constitution that protects every citizen.     </p>
<p>                    Important, revealing, and powerfully argued, The Threat tells the true story of what the FBI is, how it works, and why it will endure as an institution of integrity that protects America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Makes for compelling reading in America today.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I want to try and understand why so many people commit crimes in the name of identity,&#8221; writes Amin Maalouf. Identity is the crucible out of which we come: our background, our race, our gender, our tribal affiliations, our religion (or lack thereof), all go into making up who we are. All too often, however, the notion of identity&#8211;personal, religious, ethnic, or national&#8211;has given rise to heated passions and even massive crimes.     </p>
<p>                    Moving across the world&#8217;s history, faiths, and politics, he argues against an oversimplified and hostile interpretation of the concept. He cogently and persuasively examines identity in the context of the modern world, where it can be viewed as both glory and poison. Evident here are the dangers of using identity as a protective&#8211;and therefore aggressive&#8211;mechanism, the root of racial, geographical, and colonialist subjugation throughout history.     </p>
<p>                    Maalouf contends that many of us would reject our inherited conceptions of identity, to which we cling through habit, if only we examined them more closely. The future of society depends on accepting all identities, while recognizing our individualism.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic New York Times bestseller that &#8216;struck the spark that would eventually light the fire of Black Lives Matter&#8217; (Ibram X. Kendi)    </p>
<p>                    Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by Entertainment Weekly&#8217; Slate&#8217; Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217; Literary Hub and Book Riot    </p>
<p>                    Once in a great while a book comes along that radically changes our understanding of a crucial political issue and helps to fuel a social movement. The New Jim Crow is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in   millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in  the Civil Rights movement.      </p>
<p>                    Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States, The New Jim Crow reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By   targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.     </p>
<p>                    A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice, The New Jim Crow is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;Unfair succinctly and persuasively recounts cutting-edge research testifying to the faulty and inaccurate procedures that underpin virtually all aspects of our criminal justice system, illustrating many with case studies.&#8221;&#8211;The Boston Globe    </p>
<p>                     A child is gunned down by a police officer; an investigator ignores critical clues in a case; an innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit; a jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken.     </p>
<p>                     But it&#8217;s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.     </p>
<p>                     This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant&#8217;s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In Unfair, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.     </p>
<p>                     Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases&#8211;from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case&#8211;Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society&#8217;s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system&#8217;s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A handwriting expert reveals the secrets hidden in your penmanship-now featuring a new afterword analyzing the handwriting of President Donald Trump.    </p>
<p>                    Handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold-the only civilian to be invited to the United States Secret Service&#8217;s Advanced Document Examination training program-draws on her extensive experience helping law enforcement agencies around the country on cases involving kidnapping, arson, forgery, murder, embezzlement, and stalking to take us inside the mysterious world of crossed t&#8217;s and dotted i&#8217;s.    </p>
<p>                    In Sex, Lies, and Handwriting, Dresbold explains how a single sentence can provide insight into a person&#8217;s background, psychology, and behavior. Throughout the book, Dresbold explores the handwriting of sly politicians, convicted criminals, notorious killers, suspected cheats, and ordinary people who&#8217;ve written to Dresbold&#8217;s &#8220;The Handwriting Doctor&#8221; column for help. She shows you how to identify the signs of a dirty rotten scoundrel and a lying, cheating, backstabbing lover. And she introduces you to some of the most dangerous traits in handwriting, including weapon-shaped letters, &#8220;shark&#8217;s teeth,&#8221; &#8220;club strokes,&#8221; and &#8220;felon&#8217;s claws.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    Dresbold also explains how criminals are tracked through handwritten clues and what spouses, friends, or employees might be hiding in their script. Sex, Lies, and Handwriting will have you paying a bit more attention to your-and everyone else&#8217;s-penmanship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything drug cartels do to survive and prosper they&#8217;ve learnt from big business &#8211; brand value and franchising from McDonald&#8217;s, supply chain management from Walmart, diversification from Coca-Cola. Whether it&#8217;s human resourcing, R&#038;D, corporate social responsibility, off-shoring, problems with e-commerce or troublesome changes in legislation, the drug lords face the same strategic concerns companies like Ryanair or Apple. So when the drug cartels start to think like big business, the only way to understand them is using economics.     </p>
<p>                    In Narconomics, Tom Wainwright meets everyone from coca farmers in secret Andean locations, deluded heads of state in presidential palaces, journalists with a price on their head, gang leaders who run their empires from dangerous prisons and teenage hitmen on city streets &#8211; all in search of the economic truth.</p>
