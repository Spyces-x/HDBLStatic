										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magnificent&#8230; Freakonomics for football&#8217; &#8211; Guardian    </p>
<p>                              This is the revised and expanded 5th edition of the international bestseller about why Spain, Germany and Brazil win, and why the USA, Japan, Australia &#8211; and even Iraq &#8211; are destined to become the kings of the world&#8217;s most popular sport.    </p>
<p>                              Football truly is the world&#8217;s favourite game, followed in over 200 countries by hundreds of millions of people pouring their hearts and souls into supporting their chosen team every week.    </p>
<p>                              But behind the passion are questions that all true football aficionados want to know: why do England lose whilst German and Brazil win? How have Spain conquered the world? Why do so many clubs buy the wrong players?    </p>
<p>                              Fully revised and updated, Soccernomics is the revolutionary guide from an economist and a sports writer who answer all these questions and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Based on her inspiring, viral 2018 commencement speech to Barnard College&#8217;s graduates in New York City, New York Times bestselling author, two-time Olympic gold medallist and FIFA World Cup champion Abby Wambach delivers her empowering rally cry for women to unleash their individual power, unite with their pack, and emerge victorious together.    </p>
<p>                    Abby Wambach became a champion because of her incredible talent as a football player. She became an icon because of her remarkable wisdom as a leader. As the co-captain of the 2015 Women&#8217;s World Cup Champion Team, she created a culture not just of excellence, but of honour, commitment, resilience, and sisterhood. She helped transform a group of individual women into one of the most successful, powerful and united Wolfpacks of all time.    </p>
<p>                    In her retirement, Abby&#8217;s ready to do the same for her new team: All Women Everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    She insists that women must let go of old rules of leadership that neither include or serve them. She&#8217;s created a new set of Wolfpack rules to help women unleash their individual power, unite with their Wolfpack, and change the landscape of their lives and world.    </p>
<p>                    * Make failure your fuel: Transform failure to wisdom and power.<br />
                    * Lead from the bench: Lead from wherever you are.<br />
                    * Champion each other: Claim each woman&#8217;s victory as your own.<br />
                    * Demand the effing ball: Don&#8217;t ask permission: take what you&#8217;ve earned.    </p>
<p>                    In Abby&#8217;s vision, we are not Little Red Riding Hoods, staying on the path because we&#8217;re told to. We are the wolves, fighting for a better tomorrow for ourselves, our pack, and all the future wolves who will come after us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praise for Mind Gym    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Believing in yourself is paramount to success for any athlete. Gary&#8217;s lessons and David&#8217;s writing provide examples of the importance of the mental game.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Ben Crenshaw, two-time Masters champion and former Ryder Cup captain    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Mind Gym hits a home run. If you want to build mental muscle for the major leagues, read this book.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Ken Griffey Jr., Major League Baseball MVP    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I read Mind Gym on my way to the Sydney Olympics and really got a lot out of it. Gary has important lessons to teach, and you&#8217;ll find the exercises fun and beneficial.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Jason Kidd, NBA All-Star and Olympic gold-medal winner    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I love the book Mind Gym.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Madison Kocian, 2016 U.S. Women&#8217;s Gymnastics Team, 2015 Uneven Bars World Champion, as told to Us Weekly    </p>
<p>                    In Mind Gym, noted sports psychology consultant Gary Mack explains how your mind influences your performance on the field or on the court as much as your physical skill does, if not more so. Through forty accessible lessons and inspirational anecdotes from prominent athletes&#8211;many of whom he has worked with&#8211;you will learn the same techniques and exercises Mack uses to help elite athletes build mental &#8220;muscle.&#8221; Mind Gym will give you the &#8220;head edge&#8221; over the competition.</p>
