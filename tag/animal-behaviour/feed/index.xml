										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The remarkable story of how mimicry is used by some of the most extraordinary creatures in the world    </p>
<p>                     Nature has perfected the art of deception. Thousands of creatures all over the world-including butterflies, moths, fish, birds, insects and snakes-have honed and practiced camouflage over hundreds of millions of years. Imitating other animals or their surroundings, nature&#8217;s fakers use mimicry to protect themselves, to attract and repel, to bluff and warn, to forage, and to hide. The advantages of mimicry are obvious-but how does &#8220;blind&#8221; nature do it? And how has humanity learned to profit from nature&#8217;s ploys?    </p>
<p>                    Dazzled and Deceived tells the unique and fascinating story of mimicry and camouflage in science, art, warfare, and the natural world. Discovered in the 1850s by the young English naturalists Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace in the Amazonian rainforest, the phenomenon of mimicry was seized upon as the first independent validation of Darwin&#8217;s theory of natural selection. But mimicry and camouflage also created a huge impact outside the laboratory walls. Peter Forbes&#8217;s cultural history links mimicry and camouflage to art, literature, military tactics, and medical cures across the twentieth century, and charts its intricate involvement with the perennial dispute between evolution and creationism.    </p>
<p>                    As Dazzled and Deceived unravels the concept of mimicry, Forbes introduces colorful stories and a dazzling cast of characters-Roosevelt, Picasso, Nabokov, Churchill, and Darwin himself, to name a few-whom its mystery influenced and enthralled. Illuminating and lively, Dazzled and Deceived sheds new light on the greatest quest: to understand the processes of life at its deepest level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When did humans begin to kiss? Why is kissing integral to some cultures and alien to others? Do good kissers make the best lovers? And is that expensive lip-plumping gloss worth it? Sheril Kirshenbaum, a marine biologist and science journalist, tackles these questions and more in THE SCIENCE OF KISSING. It&#8217;s everything you always wanted to know about kissing but either haven&#8217;t asked, can&#8217;t find out, or didn&#8217;t realize you should understand. Sheril&#8217;s a serious scientist, and the material here is informed by the results of the latest studies and theories, but she&#8217;s also got an engaging, delightful voice and offers information with a light, humorous touch. Topics range from the kind of kissing men like to do (as distinct from women), to what animals can teach us about the kiss, to whether or not the true art of kissing was lost sometime in the Dark Ages, to what, really, makes us kiss. Employing an interdisciplinary approach&#8211;drawing upon classical history, evolutionary biology, psychology, popular culture, and more&#8211;Kirshenbaum&#8217;s winning book will appeal to romantics and armchair scientists alike.</p>
