										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this powerful entry in the #1 New York Times bestselling series, Mercy Thompson must face a deadly enemy to defend all she loves&#8230; </p>
<p>                     My name is Mercedes Athena Thompson Hauptman, and I am a car mechanic.<br />
                    And a coyote shapeshifter.<br />
                    And the mate of the Alpha of the Columbia Basin werewolf pack. </p>
<p>                     Even so, none of that would have gotten me into trouble if, a few months ago, I hadn&#8217;t stood upon a bridge and taken responsibility for the safety of the citizens who lived in our territory. It seemed like the thing to do at the time. It should have only involved hunting down killer goblins, zombie goats, and an occasional troll. Instead, our home was viewed as neutral ground, a place where humans would feel safe to come and treat with the fae. </p>
<p>                     The reality is that nothing and no one is safe. As generals and politicians face off with the Gray Lords of the fae, a storm is coming and her name is Death. </p>
<p>                     But we are pack, and we have given our word. </p>
<p>                     We will die to keep it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mercy Thompson has been hailed as &#8220;a heroine who&#8230;always remains true to herself&#8221; (Library Journal). Now she&#8217;s back, and she&#8217;ll soon discover that when the fae stalk the human world, it&#8217;s the children who suffer&#8230;     </p>
<p>                     Tensions between the fae and humans are coming to a head. And when coyote shapeshifter Mercy and her Alpha werewolf mate, Adam, are called upon to stop a rampaging troll, they find themselves with something that could be used to make the fae back down and forestall out-and-out war: a human child stolen long ago by the fae.     </p>
<p>                     Defying the most powerful werewolf in the country, the humans, and the fae, Mercy, Adam, and their pack choose to protect the boy no matter what the cost. But who will protect them from a boy who is fire touched?</p>
