										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the town of Ada, Oklahoma, Ron Williamson was going to be the next Mickey Mantle. But on his way to the Big Leagues, Ron stumbled, his dreams broken by drinking, drugs, and women. Then, on a winter night in 1982, not far from Ron&#8217;s home, a young cocktail waitress named Debra Sue Carter was savagely murdered. The investigation led nowhere. Until, on the flimsiest evidence, it led to Ron Williamson. The washed-up small-town hero was charged, tried, and sentenced to death&#8211;in a trial littered with lying witnesses and tainted evidence that would shatter a man&#8217;s already broken life&#8230;and let a true killer go free. Impeccably researched, grippingly told, filled with eleventh-hour drama, John Grisham&#8217;s first work of nonfiction reads like a page-turning legal thriller. It is a book that will terrify anyone who believes in the presumption of innocence&#8211;a book no American can afford to miss.    </p>

<p>                    &#8220;BEST NONFICTION BOOK OF THE 20TH CENTURY&#8221; &#8211;Time    </p>
<p>                    The Nobel Prize winner&#8217;s towering masterpiece of world literature, the searing record of four decades of terror and oppression, in one abridged volume (authorized by the author). Features a new foreword by Anne Applebaum.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;It is impossible to name a book that had a greater effect on the political and moral consciousness of the late twentieth century.&#8221; &#8211;David Remnick, The New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own experiences before, during and after his eleven years of incarceration and exile, on evidence provided by more than 200 fellow prisoners, and on Soviet archives, Solzhenitsyn reveals with torrential narrative and dramatic power the entire apparatus of Soviet repression, the state within the state that once ruled all-powerfully with its creation by Lenin in 1918. Through truly Shakespearean portraits of its victims-this man, that woman, that child-we encounter the secret police operations, the labor camps and prisons, the uprooting or extermination of whole populations, the &#8220;welcome&#8221; that awaited Russian soldiers who had been German prisoners of war. Yet we also witness astounding moral courage, the incorruptibility with which the occasional individual or a few scattered groups, all defenseless, endured brutality and degradation. And Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s genius has transmuted this grisly indictment into a literary miracle.    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The greatest and most powerful single indictment of a political regime ever leveled in modern times.&#8221; &#8211;George F. Kennan    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An &#8220;extraordinary, unforgettable&#8221; (Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow) memoir of redemption and second chances amidst America&#8217;s mass incarceration epidemic, from a member of Oprah&#8217;s SuperSoul 100     </p>
<p>                    Shaka Senghor was raised in a middle-class neighborhood on Detroit&#8217;s east side during the height of the 1980s crack epidemic. An honor roll student and a natural leader, he dreamed of becoming a doctor&#8211;but at age eleven, his parents&#8217; marriage began to unravel, and beatings from his mother worsened, which sent him on a downward spiral. He ran away from home, turned to drug dealing to survive, and ended up in prison for murder at the age of nineteen, full of anger and despair.     </p>
<p>                    Writing My Wrongs is the story of what came next. During his nineteen-year incarceration, seven of which were spent in solitary confinement, Senghor discovered literature, meditation, self-examination, and the kindness of others&#8211;tools he used to confront the demons of his past, forgive the people who hurt him, and begin atoning for the wrongs he had committed. Upon his release at age thirty-eight, Senghor became an activist and mentor to young men and women facing circumstances like his. His work in the community and the courage to share his story led him to fellowships at the MIT Media Lab and the Kellogg Foundation and invitations to speak at events like TED and the Aspen Ideas Festival.     </p>
<p>                    In equal turns, Writing My Wrongs is a page-turning portrait of life in the shadow of poverty, violence, and fear; an unforgettable story of redemption; and a compelling witness to our country&#8217;s need for rethinking its approach to crime, prison, and the men and women sent there.</p>

<p>                    The Instant New York Times Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    A powerful, revealing story of hope, love, justice, and the power of reading by a man who spent thirty years on death row for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An amazing and heartwarming story, it restores our faith in the inherent goodness of humanity.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Archbishop Desmond Tutu     </p>
<p>                     In 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free.     </p>
<p>                     But with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence&#8211;full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon&#8211;transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.     </p>
<p>                     With a foreword by Stevenson,  The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times. Destined to be a classic memoir of wrongful imprisonment and freedom won, Hinton&#8217;s memoir tells his dramatic thirty-year journey and shows how you can take away a man&#8217;s freedom, but you can&#8217;t take away his imagination, humor, or joy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic New York Times bestseller that &#8216;struck the spark that would eventually light the fire of Black Lives Matter&#8217; (Ibram X. Kendi)    </p>
<p>                    Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by Entertainment Weekly&#8217; Slate&#8217; Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217; Literary Hub and Book Riot    </p>
<p>                    Once in a great while a book comes along that radically changes our understanding of a crucial political issue and helps to fuel a social movement. The New Jim Crow is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in   millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in  the Civil Rights movement.      </p>
<p>                    Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States, The New Jim Crow reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By   targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.     </p>
<p>                    A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice, The New Jim Crow is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century.</p>
