										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From one of China&#8217;s most acclaimed and decorated writers comes a powerful first-person account of life in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>                    On January 25, 2020, after the central government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan, acclaimed Chinese writer Fang Fang began publishing an online diary. In the days and weeks that followed, Fang Fang&#8217;s nightly postings gave voice to the fears, frustrations, anger, and hope of millions of her fellow citizens, reflecting on the psychological impact of forced isolation, the role of the internet as both community lifeline and source of misinformation, and most tragically, the lives of neighbors and friends taken by the deadly virus. </p>
<p>                    A fascinating eyewitness account of events as they unfold, Wuhan Diary captures the challenges of daily life and the changing moods and emotions of being quarantined without reliable information. Fang Fang finds solace in small domestic comforts and is inspired by the courage of friends, health professionals and volunteers, as well as the resilience and perseverance of Wuhan&#8217;s nine million residents. But, by claiming the writer´s duty to record she also speaks out against social injustice, abuse of power, and other problems which impeded the response to the epidemic and gets herself embroiled in online controversies because of it.</p>
<p>                    As Fang Fang documents the beginning of the global health crisis in real time, we are able to identify patterns and mistakes that many of the countries dealing with the novel coronavirus have later repeated. She reminds us that, in the face of the new virus, the plight of the citizens of Wuhan is also that of citizens everywhere. As Fang Fang writes: &#8220;The virus is the common enemy of humankind; that is a lesson for all humanity. The only way we can conquer this virus and free ourselves from its grip is for all members of humankind to work together.&#8221; </p>
<p>                    Blending the intimate and the epic, the profound and the quotidian, Wuhan Diary is a remarkable record of an extraordinary time. </p>
<p>                    Translated from the Chinese by Michael Berry</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, despite continued developments in forecasting, tracking, and warning technology, the United States was hit by the deadliest tornado season in decades. More than 1,200 tornadoes touched down, shattering communities and their safety nets and killing more than 500 people &#8211; a death toll unmatched since 1953. Drawing on the unique analysis described in their first book, &#8220;Economic and Societal Impacts of Tornadoes&#8221;, economists Kevin M. Simmons and Daniel Sutter here examine the factors that contributed to the outcomes of such tornadoes as the mid-April outbreak that devastated communities in North Carolina, the &#8220;Super Outbreak&#8221; across the southern and eastern United States in late April, and the single, mile-wide funnel that touched down in Joplin, Missouri in late May. In the course of their study the authors identify patterns and anomalies and reconsider previous assertions about the effectiveness of the Doppler radar and storm warning systems. Their conclusions, as well their assessment of early recovery efforts, are aimed at helping community leaders and policymakers keep vulnerable populations safer in the future.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Endlessly fascinating, brimming with insight, and more fun than a book about failure has any right to be.&#8217; &#8211; Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit     </p>
<p>                    What can we learn from our most disastrous failures?    </p>
<p>                    An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital.    </p>
<p>                    The Starbucks publicity stunt that spectacularly backfired.    </p>
<p>                    The mix-up at the 2017 Oscars ceremony.    </p>
<p>                    As technology rapidly advances, it brings with it an explosion of complexity that can trip us up. Meltdown uses real-life examples to reveal how errors in thinking, perception, and design lie behind both our everyday mistakes and our most terrifying disasters. It reveals how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. This eye-opening book will change the way you see our complex world &#8211; and your place within it.    </p>

<p>                     Mahaffey, a long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy, looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*WINNER OF THE BAILLIE GIFFORD PRIZE FOR NON-FICTION 2018*<br />
                    *WINNER OF THE PUSHKIN HOUSE BOOK PRIZE 2019*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As moving as it is painstakingly researched. . . a cracking read&#8217; Viv Groskop, Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A riveting account of human error and state duplicity. . . rightly being hailed as a classic&#8217; Hannah Betts, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    On 26 April 1986 at 1.23am a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant in Soviet Ukraine exploded. While the authorities scrambled to  understand what was occurring, workers, engineers, firefighters and  those living in the area were abandoned to their fate. The blast put the  world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, contaminating over half of  Europe with radioactive fallout.    </p>
<p>                    In Chernobyl, award-winning  historian Serhii Plokhy draws on recently opened archives to recreate  these events in all their drama. A moment by moment account of the heroes, perpetrators and victims of a tragedy, Chernobyl is the first full account of a gripping, unforgettable Cold War story.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling history of the 1986 disaster and its aftermath . . .  plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl  control room on that fateful night when human frailty and design flaws  combined to such devastating effect&#8217; Daniel Beer, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Haunting &#8230; near-Tolstoyan. His voice is humane and inflected with nostalgia&#8217; Roland Elliott Brown, Spectator     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Extraordinary,  vividly written, powerful storytelling &#8230; the first full-scale history  of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disaster, one of the defining moments in  the Cold War, told minute by minute&#8217; Victor Sebestyen Sunday Times    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Here at last is the monumental history the disaster deserves&#8217; Julie McDowall, The Times</p>
