										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Command and Control interweaves the minute-by-minute story of an accident at a missile silo in rural Arkansas, where a single crew struggled to prevent the explosion of the most powerful nuclear warhead ever built by the United States, with a historical narrative that spans more than fifty years. It depicts the urgent effort to ensure that nuclear weapons can&#8217;t be stolen, sabotaged, used without permission, or detonated inadvertently. Schlosser also looks at the Cold War from a new perspective, offering history from the ground up, telling the stories of bomber pilots, missile commanders, maintenance crews, and other ordinary servicemen who risked their lives to avert a nuclear holocaust. Drawing on recently declassified documents and interviews with men who designed and routinely handled nuclear weapons, Command and Control takes readers into a terrifying but fascinating world that, until now, has been largely hidden from view.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the moment radiation was discovered in the late nineteenth century, nuclear science has had a rich history of innovative scientific exploration and discovery, coupled with mistakes, accidents, and downright disasters.    </p>
<p>                     Mahaffey, a long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy, looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns.    </p>
<p>                     Every incident has lead to new facets in understanding about the mighty atom-and Mahaffey puts forth what the future should be for this final frontier of science that still holds so much promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emma Watson&#8217;s Our Shared Shelf book club choice<br />
                    New York Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Fascinating.&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                     &#8216;Thrilling.&#8217;       Mail on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    All they wanted was the chance to shine.    </p>
<p>                     Be careful what you wish for&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The first thing we asked was, &#8220;Does this stuff hurt you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The company said that it wasn&#8217;t dangerous, that we didn&#8217;t need to be afraid.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     As the First World War spread across the world, young American women flocked to work in factories, painting clocks, watches and military dials with a special luminous substance made from radium. It was a fun job, lucrative and glamorous &#8211; the girls shone brightly in the dark, covered head to toe in dust from the paint.    </p>
<p>                     However, as the years passed, the women began to suffer from mysterious and crippling illnesses. It turned out that the very thing that had made them feel alive &#8211; their work &#8211; was slowly killing them: the radium paint was poisonous.    </p>
<p>                     Their employers denied all responsibility, but these courageous women &#8211; in the face of unimaginable suffering &#8211; refused to accept their fate quietly, and instead became determined to fight for justice.<br />
                     Drawing on previously unpublished diaries, letters and interviews, The Radium Girls is an intimate narrative of an unforgettable true story. It is the powerful tale of a group of ordinary women from the Roaring Twenties, who themselves learned how to roar.    </p>
<p>                    Further praise for The Radium Girls    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;The importance of the brave and blighted dial-painters cannot be overstated.&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;A perfect blend of the historical, the scientific and the personal.&#8217; Bustle    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Thrilling and carefully crafted.&#8217; Mail on Sunday</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*WINNER OF THE BAILLIE GIFFORD PRIZE FOR NON-FICTION 2018*<br />
                    *WINNER OF THE PUSHKIN HOUSE BOOK PRIZE 2019*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As moving as it is painstakingly researched. . . a cracking read&#8217; Viv Groskop, Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A riveting account of human error and state duplicity. . . rightly being hailed as a classic&#8217; Hannah Betts, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    On 26 April 1986 at 1.23am a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant in Soviet Ukraine exploded. While the authorities scrambled to  understand what was occurring, workers, engineers, firefighters and  those living in the area were abandoned to their fate. The blast put the  world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, contaminating over half of  Europe with radioactive fallout.    </p>
<p>                    In Chernobyl, award-winning  historian Serhii Plokhy draws on recently opened archives to recreate  these events in all their drama. A moment by moment account of the heroes, perpetrators and victims of a tragedy, Chernobyl is the first full account of a gripping, unforgettable Cold War story.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling history of the 1986 disaster and its aftermath . . .  plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl  control room on that fateful night when human frailty and design flaws  combined to such devastating effect&#8217; Daniel Beer, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Haunting &#8230; near-Tolstoyan. His voice is humane and inflected with nostalgia&#8217; Roland Elliott Brown, Spectator     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Extraordinary,  vividly written, powerful storytelling &#8230; the first full-scale history  of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disaster, one of the defining moments in  the Cold War, told minute by minute&#8217; Victor Sebestyen Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Plays out like a classical tragedy &#8230; fascinating&#8217; Julian Evans, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Here at last is the monumental history the disaster deserves&#8217; Julie McDowall, The Times</p>
