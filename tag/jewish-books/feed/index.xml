										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bolder, even, than the ambitious books for which Stephen Greenblatt is already renowned, The Rise and Fall of Adam and Eve explores the enduring story of humanity&#8217;s first parents. Comprising only a few ancient verses, the story of Adam and Eve has served as a mirror in which we seem to glimpse the whole, long history of our fears and desires, as both a hymn to human responsibility and a dark fable about human wretchedness.    </p>
<p>                     Tracking the tale into the deep past, Greenblatt uncovers the tremendous theological, artistic, and cultural investment over centuries that made these fictional figures so profoundly resonant in the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim worlds and, finally, so very &#8220;real&#8221; to millions of people even in the present. With the uncanny brilliance he previously brought to his depictions of William Shakespeare and Poggio Bracciolini (the humanist monk who is the protagonist of The Swerve), Greenblatt explores the intensely personal engagement of Augustine, Durer, and Milton in this mammoth project of collective creation, while he also limns the diversity of the story&#8217;s offspring: rich allegory, vicious misogyny, deep moral insight, and some of the greatest triumphs of art and literature.    </p>
<p>                     The biblical origin story, Greenblatt argues, is a model for what the humanities still have to offer: not the scientific nature of things, but rather a deep encounter with problems that have gripped our species for as long as we can recall and that continue to fascinate and trouble us today.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the religious historian whose The Gnostic Gospels won both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award comes a dramatic interpretation of Satan and his role on the Christian tradition. With magisterial learning and the elan of a born storyteller, Pagels turns Satan&#8217;s story into an audacious exploration of Christianity&#8217;s shadow side, in which the gospel of love gives way to irrational hatreds that continue to haunt Christians and non-Christians alike.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A practical approach to creating wealth-based on the established principles of ancient Jewish wisdom-made accessible to people of all backgrounds  The ups and downs of the economy prove Rabbi Daniel Lapin&#8217;s famous principle that the more things change, the more we need to depend upon the things that never change.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Holocaust survivor&#8217;s surprising and thought-provoking study of forgiveness, justice, compassion, and human responsibility, featuring contributions from the Dalai Lama, Harry Wu, Cynthia Ozick, Primo Levi, and more.     </p>
<p>                    While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, Simon Wiesenthal was taken one day from his work detail to the bedside of a dying member of the SS. Haunted by the crimes in which he had participated, the soldier wanted to confess to&#8211;and obtain absolution from&#8211;a Jew. Faced with the choice between compassion and justice, silence and truth, Wiesenthal said nothing. But even years after the way had ended, he wondered: Had he done the right thing? What would you have done in his place?     </p>
<p>                    In this important book, fifty-three distinguished men and women respond to Wiesenthal&#8217;s questions. They are theologians, political leaders, writers, jurists, psychiatrists, human rights activists, Holocaust survivors, and victims of attempted genocides in Bosnia, Cambodia, China and Tibet. Their responses, as varied as their experiences of the world, remind us that Wiesenthal&#8217;s questions are not limited to events of the past.</p>
