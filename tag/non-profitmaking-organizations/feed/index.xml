										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is commonplace that counselors, therapists, teachers, business leaders, executives, coaches, and other helping professionals &#8211; specifically trained in group leadership &#8211; often fail to apply their knowledge and skills to settings in which they might matter most. The same practitioners who guide others may not be able to put that background to work when they find themselves supervising peers, leading meetings, or even managing conflict at the dinner table. What<br />
                    You Don&#8217;t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should discusses ways that leadership skills and interventions can operate throughout daily life. Applications from group therapy and systemic intervention models will be applied to the realities that people face every day &#8211; inspiring others, facilitating<br />
                    meetings, running social events, guiding conversations, and empowering others. This text uniquely integrates the latest research, theory, concepts, and skills into a model that applies these ideas to every aspect of daily life. The author draws not only from the extensive literature in group dynamics, counseling, and psychology, but also includes insights from business leaders gleaned from over a dozen interviews he conducted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can you imagine a choreographer only training one dancer to lead while his or her partner sits in the lobby staring at the wall? Yet we do this all the time in organizations. Half the partnership is missing.  Leadership is Half the Story introduces the first model to seamlessly integrate leadership, followership, and partnerships. This research-backed, field-tested book contributes many new ideas and practical advice for everyone in an organization &#8211; from CEO to HR director to front-line manager to consultant.  All of us lead, not just those with the formal title. All of us follow, not just front-line staff. In great collaborations, one moment we are leading and then we flip to following; in other words, the relationship between leadership and followership is dynamic, context-specific, and ever-evolving. This empowering perspective opens up leadership to everyone, normalizes followership, and enables more productive and innovative collaborations. Candid discussions about both roles allow for better coaching, mentoring, skill development, and interpersonal agility, and result in stronger teams.<br />
                    Marc and Samantha Hurwitz give us a category-busting book that &#8220;practically glows with energy and vision,&#8221; according to Marshall Goldsmith, executive coach and best-selling author of What Got You Here Won&#8217;t Get You There.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be Fearless is researched-based call to action for those seeking to live extraordinary lives and bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    LOS ANGELES TIMES BESTSELLER * NATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Weaving together storytelling, practical tips and inspiration, the book will teach you how to put the five fearless principles to work so that you too can spark the sorts of remarkable breakthroughs that can impact the world. Philanthropist, investor, and technology pioneer Jean Case brings to life the five Be Fearless principles common to the people and organizations that bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found five surprising traits they all had in common. These weren&#8217;t wealth, privilege, or even genius. What all of these exceptional men and women shared was that they had chosen to make a &#8220;big bet,&#8221; take bold risks, learn from their failures, reach beyond their bubbles, and let urgency conquer fear.    </p>
<p>                    Throughout Be Fearless, Jean vividly illustrates these principles through storytelling-from her own transformational life experiences, to Jane Goodall&#8217;s remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and protecting chimpanzees, to celebrity chef Jose Andres&#8217; decision to be a &#8220;first responder&#8221; and take his kitchen to the sites of devastating hurricanes to feed the hungry, to Madame C.J. Walker&#8217;s vision to build a hair care empire that would employ thousands across the country, and more. She shares new insights to stories you might think you know-like Airbnb&#8217;s tale of starting from scratch to transform the hospitality industry, to John F. Kennedy&#8217;s history-making moonshot-and gems from changemakers you&#8217;ve never heard of. Be Fearless features a compelling foreword from Jane Goodall saying &#8220;there is no time in history when it has been more important to Be Fearless&#8221; and a new afterword with stories of people inspired to take action after reading the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Muhammad Yunus, the practical visionary who pioneered microcredit and, with his Grameen Bank, won the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize, has developed a new dimension for capitalism which he calls &#8220;social business.&#8221; The social business model has been adopted by corporations, entrepreneurs, and social activists across the globe. Its goal is to create self-supporting, viable commercial enterprises that generate economic growth as they produce goods and services to fulfill human needs. In  Building Social Business , Yunus shows how social business can be put into practice and explains why it holds the potential to redeem the failed promise of free-market enterprise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Wood discovered his passion, his greatest success, and his life&#8217;s work not at business school or helping lead Microsoft&#8217;s charge into Asia in the 1990s but on a soul-searching trip to the Himalayas. He made the difficult decision to walk away from his lucrative career to create Room to Read, a nonprofit organization that promotes education across the developing world. By the end of 2007, the organization will have established over 5,000 libraries and 400 schools, and awarded long-term scholarships to more than 3,000 girls, giving more than one million children the lifelong gift of education.     </p>
<p>                    If you have ever pondered abandoning your desk job for an adventure and an opportunity to give back, Wood&#8217;s story will inspire you. He offers a vivid, emotional, and absorbing tale of how to take the lessons learned at a hard-charging company like Microsoft and apply them to the world&#8217;s most pressing social problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How can you get people to serve more, engage more, give more, and become champions for your cause? Now you can go beyond being the loudest voice in the room to crafting a clear, articulate message which allows donors to see themselves as part of the solution.    </p>
<p>                    Filled with insights into how strategic communications attract, engage, and retain supporters, &#8220;Raise Your Voice&#8221; is a guidebook that enables your cause to fulfill its promise and invite your donors to be part of the difference you make in people&#8217;s lives.    </p>
<p>                    This guidebook is full of practical insight for helping mission-driven organizations sustain a clear and focused mission, understand what motivates (and how to motivate) donors, build deeper relationships, and tell stories that resonate with people so they listen, care, act, and donate.    </p>
<p>                    Are you tired of trying to tell a story that resonates with donors? When your organization is not achieving its full potential or attracting new supporters, does it make you feel like there&#8217;s nothing else you can do?    </p>
<p>                    If you&#8217;re at a crossroads and don&#8217;t know what to do next, start here: Focus on building and strengthen relationships through strategic communications. When you do, your organization will flourish, thrive, and grow to achieve improved outcomes and revenue-generating results.    </p>
