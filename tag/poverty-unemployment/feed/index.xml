<p>                    &#8216;Superb, hugely enjoyable &#8230; a spirited examination of the hubris and  hypocrisy of the super-rich who claim they are helping the world&#8217; Aditya  Chakrabortty, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    What explains the spreading backlash against the global elite? In this revelatory investigation, Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, showing how the elite follow a &#8216;win-win&#8217; logic, fighting for equality and justice any way they can &#8211; except ways that threaten their position at the top.     </p>
<p>                    But why should our gravest problems be solved by consultancies, technology companies and corporate-sponsored charities instead of public institutions and elected officials? Why should we rely on scraps from the winners? Trenchant and gripping, this is an indispensable guide and call to action for elites and citizens alike.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly forty percent of humanity lives on an average of two dollars a day or less. If you&#8217;ve never had to survive on an income so small, it is hard to imagine. How would you put food on the table, afford a home, and educate your children? How would you handle emergencies and old age? Every day, more than a billion people around the world must answer these questions. Portfolios of the Poor is the first book to systematically explain how the poor find solutions to their everyday financial problems. The authors conducted year-long interviews with impoverished villagers and slum dwellers in Bangladesh, India, and South Africa&#8211;records that track penny by penny how specific households manage their money. The stories of these families are often surprising and inspiring. Most poor households do not live hand to mouth, spending what they earn in a desperate bid to keep afloat. Instead, they employ financial tools, many linked to informal networks and family ties. They push money into savings for reserves, squeeze money out of creditors whenever possible, run sophisticated savings clubs, and use microfinancing wherever available.<br />
                    Their experiences reveal new methods to fight poverty and ways to envision the next generation of banks for the &#8220;bottom billion.&#8221; Indispensable for those in development studies, economics, and microfinance, Portfolios of the Poor will appeal to anyone interested in knowing more about poverty and what can be done about it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who is the richest person in the world, ever? Does where you were born affect how much money you&#8217;ll earn over a lifetime? How would we know? Why- beyond the idle curiosity- do these questions even matter? In  The Haves and the Have-Nots , Branko Milanovic, one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on wealth, poverty, and the gap that separates them, explains these and other mysteries of how wealth is unevenly spread throughout our world, now and through time. Milanovic uses history, literature and stories straight out of today&#8217;s newspapers, to discuss one of the major divisions in our social lives: between the haves and the have-nots. He reveals just how rich Elizabeth Bennet&#8217;s suitor Mr. Darcy really was how much Anna Karenina gained by falling in love how wealthy ancient Romans compare to today&#8217;s super-rich where in Kenyan income distribution was Obama&#8217;s grandfather how we should think about Marxism in a modern world and how location where one is born determines his wealth. He goes beyond mere entertainment to explain why inequality matters, how it damages our economics prospects, and how it can threaten the foundations of the social order that we take for granted.  Bold, engaging, and illuminating,  The Haves and the Have-Nots  teaches us not only how to think about inequality, but why we should.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Book and man are brilliant, passionate, optimistic and impatient . . . Outstanding.&#8221; -The Economist    </p>
<p>                    The landmark exploration of economic prosperity and how the world can escape from extreme poverty for the world&#8217;s poorest citizens, from one  of the world&#8217;s most renowned economists    </p>
<p>                     Hailed by Time as one of the world&#8217;s hundred most influential people, Jeffrey D. Sachs is renowned for his work around the globe advising economies in crisis. Now a classic of its genre, The End of Poverty distills more than thirty years of experience to offer a uniquely informed vision of the steps that can transform impoverished countries into prosperous ones. Marrying vivid storytelling with rigorous analysis, Sachs lays out a clear conceptual map of the world economy. Explaining his own work in Bolivia, Russia, India, China, and Africa, he offers an integrated set of solutions to the interwoven economic, political, environmental, and social problems that challenge the world&#8217;s poorest countries.    </p>
<p>                     Ten years after its initial publication, The End of Poverty remains an indispensible and influential work. In this 10th anniversary edition, Sachs presents an extensive new foreword assessing the progress of the past decade, the work that remains to be done, and how each of us can help. He also looks ahead across the next fifteen years to 2030, the United Nations&#8217; target date for ending extreme poverty, offering new insights and recommendations.</p>

                     &#8216;Beautifully written, thought-provoking, and unforgettable &#8230; If you want a good understanding of how the issues that cause poverty are intertwined, you should read this book&#8217; Bill Gates, Best Books of 2017    </p>
<p>                    Arleen spends nearly all her money on rent but is kicked out with her kids in Milwaukee&#8217;s coldest winter for years. Doreen&#8217;s home is so filthy her family call it &#8216;the rat hole&#8217;. Lamar, a wheelchair-bound ex-soldier, tries to work his way out of debt for his boys. Scott, a nurse turned addict, lives in a gutted-out trailer. This is their world. And this is the twenty-first century: where fewer and fewer people can afford a simple roof over their head.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chika Jeune was born three days before the devastating earthquake that decimated Haiti in 2010. She spent her infancy in extreme poverty, and when her mother died giving birth to a baby brother, Chika was brought to the Have Faith Haiti Orphanage that Mitch and his wife, Janine operate.    </p>
<p>                    Chika&#8217;s arrival made a quick impression. Brave and self-assured, even as a three-year-old, she delighted the other kids and teachers. But at age five, Chika was suddenly diagnosed with a terminal disease that no doctor in Haiti could help with.    </p>
<p>                    Mitch and Janine took Chika to America, hoping that treatment there would enable her to go back home.  Instead, Chika became a permanent part of their lives, as they embarked on a two-year, around-the-world journey to find a cure. As Chika&#8217;s boundless optimism and humour taught Mitch the joys of caring for a child, he learnt that a relationship built on love, no matter what blows it takes, can never be lost.    </p>
<p>                    This is Mitch Albom at his most poignant, powerful and personal. Chika is a celebration of a girl, her adoptive guardians, and the incredible bond they formed &#8211; a devastatingly beautiful portrait of what it means to be a family, regardless of how it is made.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The shift toward automation is about to create a tsunami of unemployment. Not in the distant future&#8211;now. One recent estimate predicts 13 million American workers will lose their jobs within the next seven years-jobs that won&#8217;t be replaced. In a future marked by restlessness and chronic unemployment, what will happen to American society?    </p>
<p>                    In The War on Normal People, Andrew Yang paints a dire portrait of the American economy. Rapidly advancing technologies like artificial intelligence, robotics and automation software are making millions of Americans&#8217; livelihoods irrelevant. The consequences are these trends are already being felt across our communities in the form of political unrest, drug use, and other social ills. The future looks dire-but is it unavoidable?    </p>
<p>                    In The War on Normal People, Yang imagines a different future &#8212; one in which having a job is distinct from the capacity to prosper and seek fulfillment. At this vision&#8217;s core is Universal Basic Income, the concept of providing all citizens with a guaranteed income-and one that is rapidly gaining popularity among forward-thinking politicians and economists. Yang proposes that UBI is an essential step toward a new, more durable kind of economy, one he calls &#8220;human capitalism.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOW A NETFLIX SERIES STARRING MARGARET QUALLEY &#038; ANDY MACDOWELL.<br />
                    BARACK OBAMA&#8217;S SUMMER READING PICK, 2019.<br />
                    BBC RADIO 4 BOOK OF THE WEEK.    </p>
<p>                    Educated meets Nickel and Dimed  in Stephanie Land&#8217;s memoir about working as a maid. A beautiful and  gritty exploration of poverty in the western world. Includes a foreword  by international bestelling author Barbara Ehrenreich.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;My daughter learned to walk in a homeless shelter.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    As  a struggling single mum, determined to keep a roof over her daughter&#8217;s  head, Stephanie Land worked for years as a maid, working long hours in  order to provide for her small family. In Maid, she reveals the dark truth of what it takes to survive and thrive in today&#8217;s inequitable society.    </p>
<p>                      As she worked hard to climb her way out of poverty as a single parent,  scrubbing the toilets of the wealthy, navigating domestic labour jobs as  a cleaner whilst also juggling higher education, assisted housing, and a  tangled web of government assistance, Stephanie wrote. She wrote the  true stories that weren&#8217;t being told. The stories of the overworked and  underpaid.    </p>
<p>                     Written in honest, heart-rending prose and with great insight, Maid  explores the underbelly of the upper-middle classes and the reality of  what it&#8217;s like to be in service to them. &#8216;I&#8217;d become a nameless ghost,&#8217;  Stephanie writes. With this book, she gives voice to the &#8216;servant&#8217;  worker, those who fight daily to scramble and scrape by for their own  lives and the lives of their children.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An inspiring personal story of redemption, second chances, and the transformative power within us all, from the founder and CEO of the nonprofit charity: water.    </p>
<p>                    At 28 years old, Scott Harrison had it all. A top nightclub promoter in New York City, his life was an endless cycle of drugs, booze, models&#8211;repeat. But 10 years in, desperately unhappy and morally bankrupt, he asked himself, What would the exact opposite of my life look like? Walking away from everything, Harrison spent the next 16 months on a hospital ship in West Africa and discovered his true calling. In 2006, with no money and less than no experience, Harrison founded charity: water. Today, his organization has raised over $400 million to bring clean drinking water to more than 10 million people around the globe.     </p>
<p>                    In Thirst, Harrison recounts the twists and turns that built charity: water into one of the most trusted and admired nonprofits in the world. Renowned for its 100% donation model, bold storytelling, imaginative branding, and radical commitment to transparency, charity: water has disrupted how social entrepreneurs work while inspiring millions of people to join its mission of bringing clean water to everyone on the planet within our lifetime.     </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of such bestselling books as Shoe Dog and Mountains Beyond Mountains, Thirst is a riveting account of how to build a better charity, a better business, a better life&#8211;and a gritty tale that proves it&#8217;s never too late to make a change.     </p>
<p>                    100% of the author&#8217;s net proceeds from Thirst will go to fund charity: water projects around the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Washington Post bestseller    </p>
<p>                    While the world has made encouraging strides in the fight against global poverty, there is a hidden crisis silently undermining our best efforts to help the poor.     </p>
<p>                    It is a plague of everyday violence.    </p>
<p>                    Beneath the surface of the world&#8217;s poorest communities, common violence &#8211; like rape, forced labor, illegal detention, land theft, police abuse and other brutality &#8211; has become routine and relentless.  And like a horde of locusts devouring everything in their path, the unchecked plague of violence ruins lives, blocks the road out of poverty, and undercuts development.     </p>
<p>                    How has this plague of violence grown so ferocious? The answer is terrifying, and startlingly simple: There&#8217;s nothing shielding the poor from violent people.  In one of the most remarkable &#8211; and unremarked upon &#8211; social disasters of the last half century, basic public justice systems in the developing world have descended into a state of utter collapse.     </p>
<p>                    Gary A. Haugen and Victor Boutros offer a searing account of how we got here &#8211; and what it will take to end the plague. Filled with vivid real-life stories and startling new data, The Locust Effect is a gripping journey into the streets and slums where fear is a daily reality for billions of the world&#8217;s poorest ,where safety is secured only for those with money, and where much of our well-intended aid is lost in the daily chaos of violence.    </p>
<p>                    While their call to action is urgent, Haugen and Boutros provide hope, a real solution and an ambitious way forward. The Locust Effect is a wake-up call: Its massive implications will forever change the way we understand global poverty &#8211; and will help secure a safe path to prosperity for the global poor in the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Annawadi is a slum at the edge of Mumbai Airport, in the shadow of shining new luxury hotels. Its residents are garbage recyclers and construction workers, economic migrants, all of them living in the hope that a small part of India&#8217;s booming future will eventually be theirs. But when a crime rocks the slum community and global recession and terrorism shocks the city, tensions over religion, caste, sex, power, and economic envy begin to turn brutal. As Boo gets to know those who dwell at Mumbai&#8217;s margins, she evokes an extraordinarily vivid and vigorous group of individuals flourishing against the odds amid the complications, corruptions and gross inequalities of the new India.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the income gap between developed and developing nations grows, so grows the cacophony of voices claiming that the quest to find a simple recipe for economic growth has failed.  Getting Better , in sharp contrast, reports the good news about global progress. Economist Charles Kenny argues against development naysayers by pointing to the evidence of widespread improvements in health, education, peace, liberty- and even happiness. Kenny shows how the spread of cheap technologies, such as vaccines and bed nets, and ideas, such as political rights, has transformed the world. He also shows that by understanding this transformation, we can make the world an even better place to live. That&#8217;s not to say that life is grand for everyone, or that we don&#8217;t have a long way to go. But improvements have spread far, and, according to Kenny, they can spread even further.</p>
