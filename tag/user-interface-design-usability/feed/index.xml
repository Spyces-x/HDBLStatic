										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many businesses are based on creating desirable experiences, products and services for users. However, companies often fail to consider the end user &#8211; the consumer &#8211; in their planning and development processes. How can marketing practitioners effectively understand their customers and create products and services that work for them? This book has the answers.    </p>
<p>                    User experience research, also known as UX research, focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs and motivations through a range of observational techniques, task analysis and other methodologies. User Research is a practical guide that shows readers how to use the vast array of user research methods available. Written by one of the UK&#8217;s leading UX research professionals, readers can benefit from in-depth knowledge that explores the fundamentals of user research.    </p>
<p>                    Covering all the key research methods including face-to-face user testing, card sorting, surveys, A/B testing and many more, the book gives expert insight into the nuances, advantages and disadvantages of each, while also providing guidance on how to interpret, analyze and share the data once it has been obtained. Now in its second edition, User Research provides a new chapter on research operations and infrastructure as well as new material on combining user research methodologies.</p>
