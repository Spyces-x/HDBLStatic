<p>                    The Seven Storey Mountain tells of the growing restlessness of a brilliant and passionate young man, who at the age of twenty-six, takes vows in one of the most demanding Catholic orders&#8211;the Trappist monks. At the Abbey of Gethsemani, &#8220;the four walls of my new freedom,&#8221; Thomas Merton struggles to withdraw from the world, but only after he has fully immersed himself in it. At the abbey, he wrote this extraordinary testament, a unique spiritual autobiography that has been recognized as one of the most influential religious works of our time. Translated into more than twenty languages, it has touched millions of lives.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; You can choose hope in the midst of chaos. The visionary behind the million-strong IF: Gathering challenges you to exercise your God-given power to shift negative thinking patterns and take back control of your thoughts and emotions.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A must-have resource for anyone looking to get control of their thoughts.&#8221;&#8211;Lysa TerKeurst, #1 New York Times bestselling author and president of Proverbs 31 Ministries     </p>
<p>                    CHRISTIAN BOOK AWARD FINALIST &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY COSMOPOLITAN     </p>
<p>                    Are your thoughts holding you captive? I&#8217;ll never be good enough. Other people have better lives than I do. God couldn&#8217;t really love me. Jennie Allen knows what it&#8217;s like to swirl in a spiral of destructive thoughts, but she also knows we don&#8217;t have to stay stuck in toxic thinking patterns.     </p>
<p>                    As she discovered in her own life, God built a way for us to escape that downward spiral. Freedom comes when we refuse to be victims to our thoughts and realize we have already been equipped with power from God to fight and win the war for our minds.     </p>
<p>                    In Get Out of Your Head,  Jennie inspires and equips us to transform our emotions, our outlook, and even our circumstances by taking control of our thoughts. Our enemy is determined to get in our heads to make us feel helpless, overwhelmed, and incapable of making a difference for the kingdom of God. But when we submit our minds to Christ, the promises and goodness of God flood our lives in remarkable ways.     </p>
<p>                    It starts in your head. And from there, the possibilities are endless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The runaway bestseller with more than four million copies in print! You too can change your life with the priceless wisdom of ten ancient scrolls handed down for thousands of years.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Every sales manager should read The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is a book to keep at the bedside, or on the living room table&#8211;a book to dip into as needed, to browse in now and then, to enjoy in small stimulating portions. It is a book for the hours and for the years, a book to turn to over and over again, as to a friend, a book of moral, spiritual and ethical guidance, an unfailing source of comfort and inspiration.&#8221;&#8211;Lester J. Bradshaw, Jr., Former Dean, Dale Carnegie Institute of Effective Speaking &#038; Human Relations     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I have read almost every book that has ever been written on salesmanship, but I think Og Mandino has captured all of them in The Greatest Salesman in the World. No one who follows these principles will ever fail as a salesman, and no one will ever be truly great without them; but, the author has done more than present the principles&#8211;he has woven them into the fabric of one of the most fascinating stories I have ever read.&#8221;&#8211;Paul J. Meyer, President of Success Motivation Institute, Inc.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I was overwhelmed by The Greatest Salesman in the World. It is, without doubt, the greatest and the most touching story I have ever read. It is so good that there are two musts that I would attach to it: First, you must not lay it down until you have finished it; and secondly, every individual who sells anything, and that includes us all, must read it.&#8221;&#8211;Robert B. Hensley, President, Life Insurance Co. of Kentucky</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this powerful and personal reflection, a New York Times bestseller, President Jimmy Carter contemplates how faith has sustained him in happiness and disappointment and considers how we may find it in our own lives.     </p>
<p>                    All his life, President Jimmy Carter has been a courageous exemplar of faith. Now he shares the lessons he learned. He writes, &#8220;The issue of faith arises in almost every area of human existence, so it is important to understand its multiple meanings. In this book, my primary goal is to explore the broader meaning of faith, its far-reaching effect on our lives, and its relationship to past, present, and future events in America and around the world. The religious aspects of faith are also covered, since this is how the word is most often used, and I have included a description of the ways my faith has guided and sustained me, as well as how it has challenged and driven me to seek a closer and better relationship with people and with God.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Quoting eminent Protestant theologians, in Faith President Carter describes his belief in religious freedom, moral politics, and the place of prayer in his daily life. He examines faith&#8217;s many meanings, he describes how to accept it, live it, how to doubt and find faith again. This is a serious and moving reflection from one of America&#8217;s most admired and respected citizens.</p>

<p>                    That journey starts right here.     </p>
<p>                    In her book, The Path Made Clear, Oprah shares what she sees as a guide for activating your deepest vision of yourself, offering the framework for creating not just a life of success, but one of significance.  The book&#8217;s ten chapters are organized to help you recognize the important milestones along the road to self-discovery, laying out what you really need in order to achieve personal contentment, and what life&#8217;s detours are there to teach us.     </p>
<p>                    Oprah opens each chapter by sharing her own key lessons and the personal stories that helped set the course for her best life. She then brings together wisdom and insights from luminaries in a wide array of fields, inspiring readers to consider what they&#8217;re meant to do in the world and how to pursue it with passion and focus. Renowned figures such as Ellen DeGeneres, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Brene Brown, Elizabeth Gilbert, Eckhart Tolle and Jay-Z share the greatest lessons from their own journeys toward a life filled with purpose.    </p>
<p>                    Paired with over one hundred awe-inspiring photographs to help illuminate the wisdom of these messages, The Path Made Clear provides a beautiful resource for achieving a life lived in service of your calling &#8211; whatever it may be.</p>
