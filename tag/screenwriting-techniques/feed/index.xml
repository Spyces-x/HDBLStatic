										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone seeking to influence others must first know their own story, and how to tell it properly. Whether you&#8217;re proposing a risky new venture, trying to close a deal, or leading a charge against injustice, you have a story to tell. Tell it well and you will create a shared experience with your listeners that can have profound results.    </p>
<p>                    In this modern classic, Annette Simmons reminds us that the oldest tool of influence is also the most powerful. Fully revised and updated to account for new technology and social media, along with two new chapters on the role of stories in the development of civilization and how to adjust your story to your specific goal, Simmons showcases over a hundred examples of effective storytelling drawn from the front lines of business and government, as well as myths, fables, and parables from around the world. Whether writing a screenplay, or announcing a corporate reorganization, Simmons illustrates how story can be used in ways that cold facts, bullet points, and directives can&#8217;t. These stories, combined with practical storytelling techniques, show anyone how to become a more effective communicator and achieve their goals.</p>
