										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1993 the esteemed journal FOREIGN AFFAIRS published an article entitled &#8220;The Clash of Civilizations?&#8221; by Samuel P. Huntington. According to the journal&#8217;s editors it went on to generate more discussion than anything they had published since the Second World War. In the article, Huntington posed the question whether conflicts between civilizations would dominate the future of world politics. In the book, he gives the answer, showing not only how clashes between civilizations are the greatest threat to world peace but also how an international order based on civilizations is the best safeguard against war. Since September 11, his thesis has seemed even more prescient and acute. THE CLASH OF CIVILIZATIONS AND THE REMAKING OF WORLD ORDER is now recognised as a classic study of international relations in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

<p>                    When we take care of our people, our people will take care of us. They will help see that our cause becomes a reality.    </p>
<p>                    In Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek, internationally bestselling author of Start With Why, investigates these great leaders from Marine Corps Officers, who don&#8217;t just sacrifice their place at the table but often their own comfort and even their lives for those in their care, to the heads of big business and government &#8211; each putting aside their own interests to protect their teams.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A training manual for our troubled times &#8230; It  makes sense of our world, but is also capable of beautifully crafted  pithy historical judgements. &#8230; It is a book that cares about liberty,  choice and a moral compass, that warns against hubris&#8217; Roger Boyes, The Times    </p>
<p>                    John Lewis Gaddis, the distinguished historian and acclaimed author of The Cold War,   has for almost two decades co-taught the grand strategy seminar at  Yale  University with his colleagues Charles Hill and Paul Kennedy. Now,  in On Grand Strategy, Gaddis reflects with insight and wit on what he has learned.    </p>
<p>                    In   chapters extending from the ancient world through World War II, Gaddis   assesses grand strategic theory and practice in Herodotus, Thucydides,   Sun Tzu, Octavian/Augustus, Saint Augustine, Machiavelli,Elizabeth I,   Philip II, the American Founding Fathers, Clausewitz, Tolstoy,Lincoln,   Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Isaiah Berlin.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;For the past 16 years Gaddis has taught a course on grand strategy to   students at Yale University. Reading his book, you wish every  university  could offer it. Gaddis roves across the centuries, offering  advice on  subjects from statecraft and warfare to leading a worthwhile  life&#8217;  Phillip Delves Broughton, Evening Standard</p>
