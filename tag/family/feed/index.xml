										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Waterstones Children&#8217;s Book Prize-winning author    </p>
<p>                    New York Times #1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    The highly anticipated second novel from Angie Thomas returns to the world of Garden Heights for a powerful story about hip hop, freedom of speech &#8211; and fighting for your dreams, even as the odds are stacked against you.    </p>
<p>                    Bri wants to be one of the greatest rappers of all time. As the daughter of an underground hip hop legend who died right before he hit big, Bri&#8217;s got massive shoes to fill. But when her first song goes viral for all the wrong reasons, Bri finds herself at the centre of controversy and portrayed by the media as more menace than MC. And with an eviction notice staring her family down, Bri no longer just wants to make it &#8211; she has to. Even if it means becoming the very thing the public has made her out to be.    </p>

<p>                     The first book in the global phenomenon from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinney &#8211; 250 million copies of the series sold worldwide! </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Let me get something straight: this is a JOURNAL not a diary&#8230; The other thing I want to clear up right away is that this was MOM&#8217;s idea, not mine.&#8217; </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Reptile Room the siblings endure a car accident, a terrible smell, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a brass reading lamp, and the re-appearance of a person they&#8217;d hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All The Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

<p>                    The second laugh-out-loud, fully-illustrated Diary of a Wimpy Kid book from #1 international bestselling author Jeff Kinney! A global phenomenon with 250 million copies of the series sold worldwide! </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s a brand-new year and a brand-new journal and Greg Heffley is keen to put the humiliating (and secret!) events of last summer firmly behind him. </p>
<p>                    But someone knows everything, someone whose job it is to most definitely not keep anything embarrassing of Greg&#8217;s private: his big brother, Rodrick. Can Greg make it through this new school year with his cool(ish) reputation intact?</p>

<p>                              You still have time to choose another international best-seller to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on &#8230;</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Vile Village the siblings face such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe cell, and some very strange hats.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Austere Academy the siblings face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E. and the metric system.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>

<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8217;s landlady, Mrs. Tupper, is the closest thing Enola has to family these days, besides her occasional run-ins with her brother Sherlock. Even though Mrs. Tupper is nearly deaf and can barely cook, she&#8217;s an endearing presence as Enola longs for her absent mother. So imagine her horror when Enola comes home to find Mrs. Tupper kidnapped! Who would take her, and why? And what does Florence Nightingale have to do with it? From the master of mystery Nancy Springer, here&#8217;s another absorbing adventure for our award-winning, unstoppable heroine, Enola Holmes. </p>

<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Enola Holmes is being hunted by the world&#8217;s most famous detective&#8211;her own brother, Sherlock Holmes. But while she is on the run in the world&#8217;s biggest, darkest, dirtiest city, she discovers a hidden cache of charcoal drawings and feels as if she is a soul mate to the girl who drew them. But that girl, Lady Cecily, has disappeared without a trace. Braving the midnight streets, Enola must unravel the clues to find this left-handed lady, but in order to save her, Enola risks revealing more than she should. Will she be able to keep her identity a secret and find Lady Cecily, or will the one thing she is trying to save&#8211;her freedom&#8211;be lost forever?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Patterson returns to the genre that made him famous with a #1 New York Times bestselling teen detective novel about the mysterious Angel family . . . and the dark secrets they&#8217;re keeping from one another.<br />
                    On the night Malcolm and Maud Angel are murdered, Tandy Angel knows just three things: 1) She was the last person to see her parents alive. 2) The police have no suspects besides Tandy and her three siblings. 3) She can&#8217;t trust anyone-maybe not even herself.<br />
                    As Tandy sets out to clear the family name, she begins to recall flashes of experiences long buried in her vulnerable psyche. These memories shed light on her family&#8217;s dark secrets, and digging deeper into her powerful parents&#8217; affairs proves to be a disturbing and dangerous game. Who knows what any of the Angels are truly capable of?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Golding&#8217;s Lord of the Flies is a dystopian classic: &#8216;exciting, relevant and thought-provoking&#8217; (Stephen King). When a group of schoolboys are stranded on a desert island, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of my favorite books &#8211; I read it every couple of years.&#8217; (Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games)</p>
<p>                    A plane crashes on a desert island. The only survivors are a group of schoolboys. By day, they discover fantastic wildlife and dazzling beaches, learning to survive; at night, they are haunted by nightmares of a primitive beast. Orphaned by society, it isn&#8217;t long before their innocent childhood games devolve into a savage, murderous hunt &#8230; </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Stands out mightily in my memory &#8230; Such a strong statement about the human heart.&#8217; (Patricia Cornwell)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Terrifying and haunting.&#8217; (Kingsley Amis)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Beautifully written, tragic and provocative.&#8217; (E. M. Forster)</p>
<p>                    ONE OF THE BBC&#8217;S ICONIC &#8216;NOVELS THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD&#8217;</p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Every real human being should read this &#8230; This is what we are.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s brilliant, it&#8217;s captivating, it&#8217;s thought provoking and brutal and for some, its truly terrifying.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;There is a reason why this is studied at school &#8230; Excellent read.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is one of the few books I&#8217;ve read that I keep on my Kindle to read again.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I revisit this every few years and it&#8217;s always fresh and impressive &#8230; One of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An irreverent and irresistible New York Times bestselling romance between the so-called Designated Ugly Fat Friend and the Hot Jock.      </p>
<p>                    Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper may not be the prettiest girl in her high school, but she has a loyal group of friends, a biting wit, and a spot-on BS detector. She&#8217;s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush, who calls Bianca the Duff&#8211;the Designated Ugly Fat Friend&#8211;of her crew.     </p>
<p>                    But things aren&#8217;t so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him.     </p>
<p>                    Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn&#8217;t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she&#8217;s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These Royals will ruin you&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself.    </p>
<p>                    Reed Royal has it all-looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.    </p>
<p>                    What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father&#8217;s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely-keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed&#8217;s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed&#8217;s entire world begins to fall apart around him.    </p>
<p>                    Ella doesn&#8217;t want him anymore. She says they&#8217;ll only destroy each other.    </p>
<p>                    She might be right.    </p>
<p>                    Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It&#8217;s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he&#8217;s going to win back his princess, he&#8217;ll need to prove himself Royally worthy.</p>

<p>                    From the author of the New York Times bestseller All the Bright Places comes a heart-wrenching story about what it means to see (and love) someone for who they truly are.    </p>
<p>                     Everyone thinks they know Libby Strout.<br />
                    I know the part I want to play here at MVB High. I want to be the girl who can do anything.    </p>
<p>                    Once dubed &#8216;America&#8217;s Fattest Teen&#8217;, she is only seen for her weight. Not the girl underneath.    </p>
<p>                    Since her mum&#8217;s death she&#8217;s been picking up the pieces in private, alone with her heartbroken father.    </p>
<p>                    But now, Libby is ready. She&#8217;s ready for high school, for new friends, for love and for every possibility life has to offer.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone thinks they know Jack Masselin too.<br />
                    Be charming. Be hilarious. Don&#8217;t get too close to anyone.    </p>
<p>                    Yes, he&#8217;s got swagger, but he&#8217;s also mastered the art of fitting in.    </p>
<p>                    What no one knows is that Jack has a secret: he can&#8217;t recognize faces. Even his own brothers are strangers to him.    </p>
<p>                    He&#8217;s the guy who can re-engineer and rebuild anything, but he can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on with the inner workings of his own brain.     </p>
<p>                     When Jack and Libby meet, they discover that the more time they spend together, the less alone they feel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay&#8217;s dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation&#8217;s favourite children&#8217;s book &#8211; Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling&#8217;s timeless classic, Jim Kay&#8217;s glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.     </p>
<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

<p>                    MAGNUS and CLEO are forced to test the strength of their love when Gaius returns to Mytica claiming he&#8217;s no longer the King of Blood but a changed man seeking redemption.     </p>
<p>                    LUCIA, pregnant with the child of a Watcher, has escaped the clutches of the unhinged fire god. Her powers are dwindling as she goes forth to fulfill a prophecy that will keep her baby safe . . . but could mean her demise.     </p>
