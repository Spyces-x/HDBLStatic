<p>                    In Feral,  George Monbiot, one of the world&#8217;s most celebrated radical thinkers  offers a riveting tale of possibility and travel in the wild    </p>
<p>                    How  many of us sometimes feel that we are scratching at the walls of this  life, seeking to find our way into a wider space beyond? That our mild,  polite existence sometimes seems to crush the breath out of us? Feral  is the lyrical and gripping story of George Monbiot&#8217;s efforts to  re-engage with nature and discover a new way of living. He shows how, by  restoring and rewilding our damaged ecosystems on land and at sea, we  can bring wonder back into our lives. Making use of some remarkable  scientific discoveries, Feral lays out a new, positive environmentalism, in which nature is allowed to find its own way.</p>

<p>                    Termites.    </p>
<p>                    Strange though it seems, scientists look to tiny termites for answers to some big ideas. Lisa Margonelli tracks them, deep into their mounds to find out how termites can change the world. Underbug: An Obsessive Tale of Termites and Technology touches on everything from meditation, innovation and the psychology of obsession to good old-fashioned biology.</p>
