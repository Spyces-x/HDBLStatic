										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The newbie investor will not find a better guide to personal finance.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Burton Malkiel, author of A RANDOM WALK DOWN WALL STREET       </p>
<p>                    TV analysts and money managers would have you believe your finances are enormously complicated, and if you don&#8217;t follow their guidance, you&#8217;ll end up in the poorhouse.     </p>
<p>                    They&#8217;re wrong.     </p>
<p>                    When University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack interviewed Helaine Olen, an award-winning financial journalist and the author of the bestselling Pound Foolish, he made an offÂ­hand suggestion: everything you need to know about managing your money could fit on an index card. To prove his point, he grabbed a 4 x 6 card, scribbled down a list of rules, and posted a picture of the card online. The post went viral.     </p>
<p>                    Now, Pollack teams up with Olen to explain why the ten simple rules of the index card outperform more complicated financial strategies. Inside is an easy-to-follow action plan that works in good times and bad, giving you the tools, knowledge, and confidence to seize control of your financial life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NOW COMPLETELY UPDATED to reflect the changes in tax legislation, health insurance, and the new investment realities. In this &#8220;highly valuable resource&#8221; (Publishers Weekly, starred review) Quinn &#8220;provides simple, straightforward&#8221; (The New York Times) solutions to the universal retirement dilemma&#8211;how to make your limited savings last for life&#8211;covering mortgages, social security, income investing, annuities, and more!      </p>
<p>                    Will you run out of money in your older age? That&#8217;s the biggest worry for people newly retired or planning to retire. Fortunately, you don&#8217;t have to plan in the dark. Jane Bryant Quinn tells you how to squeeze a higher income from all your assets&#8211;including your social security account (get every dollar you&#8217;re entitled to), a pension (discover whether a lump sum or a lifetime monthly income will pay you more), your home equity (sell, rent, or take a reverse mortgage?), savings (how to use them safely to raise your monthly income), retirement accounts (invest the money for growth in ways that let you sleep at night), and&#8211;critically&#8211;how much of your savings you can afford to spend every year without running out. There are easy ways to figure all this out. Who knew?     </p>
<p>                    Quinn also shows you how to evaluate your real risks. If you stick with super-safe investment choices, your money might not last and your lifestyle might erode. The same might be true if you rely on traditional income investments. Quinn rethinks the meaning of &#8220;income investing,&#8221; by combining reliable cash flow during the early years of your retirement with low-risk growth investments, to provide extra money for your later years. Odds are, you&#8217;ll live longer than you might imagine, meaning that your savings will stretch for many more years than you might have planned for. With the help of this book, you can turn those retirement funds into a &#8220;homemade&#8221; paycheck that will last for life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Social Security law has changed! Get What&#8217;s Yours has been revised and updated to reflect new regulations that took effect on April 29, 2016.     </p>
<p>                    Get What&#8217;s Yours has proven itself to be the definitive book about how to navigate the forbidding maze of Social Security and emerge with the highest possible benefits. It is an engaging manual of tactics and strategies written by well-known financial commentators that is unobtainable elsewhere. You could try reading all 2,728 rules of the Social Security system (and the thousands of explanations of these rules), but academia&#8217;s Kotlikoff, the popular press&#8217;s Moeller, and public television&#8217;s Solman explain the Social Security system just as comprehensively, and a lot more comprehensibly. Moreover, they demonstrate that what you don&#8217;t know can seriously hurt you: wrong decisions about which Social Security benefits to apply for cost individual retirees tens of thousands of dollars in lost income every year. (Some of those people are even in the book.)     </p>
<p>                    Changes to Social Security that take effect in 2016 make it more important than ever to wait as long as possible (until age 70, if possible) to claim Social Security benefits. The new law also has significant implications for those who wish to claim divorced spousal benefits (and how many Social Security recipients even know about divorced spousal benefits?). Besides addressing these and other issues, this revised edition contains a chapter explaining how Medicare rules can shape Social Security decisions.     </p>
<p>                    Many other personal-finance books briefly address Social Security, but none offers the full, authoritative, yet conversational analysis of Get What&#8217;s Yours.     </p>
<p>                    Get What&#8217;s Yours explains Social Security benefits through basic strategies and stirring stories. It covers the most frequent benefit scenarios faced by married retired couples; by divorced retirees; by widows and widowers. It explains what to do if you&#8217;re a retired parent of dependent children; disabled; an eligible beneficiary who continues to work. It addresses the tax consequences of your choices, as well as the financial implications for other investments. It does all this and more.     </p>
<p>                    There are more than 52 million Americans aged 54 to 69. Ten thousand of them reach Social Security&#8217;s full retirement age of 66 every day. For all these people&#8211;and for their families and friends&#8211;Get What&#8217;s Yours has proven to be an invaluable, and therefore indispensable, tool.</p>
