										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER</p>
<p>                    An adrenaline-fuelled expose of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio Garcia Martinez, this is Liar&#8217;s Poker meets The Social Network. </p>
<p>                    Computer engineers use &#8216;chaos monkey&#8217; software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio Garcia Martinez are society&#8217;s chaos monkeys &#8211; their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) &#8211; all in search of the perfect business miracle.  </p>
<p>                    Describing himself as &#8216;high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times&#8217;, Garcia Martinez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook&#8217;s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users&#8217; data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark &#8216;Zuck&#8217; Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, Garcia Martinez  took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg&#8217;s desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.</p>
<p>                    In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW &#8211; and HOW NOT &#8211; to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing.  Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, Garcia Martinez  unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital &#8216;privacy&#8217;, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Internet and smartphone are just the latest in a 250 year long cycle of disruption that has continuously changed the way we live, the way we work and the way we interact. The coming Augmented Age, however, promises a level of disruption, behavioral shifts and changes that are unparalleled. While consumers today are camping outside of an Apple store waiting to be one of the first to score a new Apple Watch or iPhone, the next generation of wearables will be able to predict if we&#8217;re likely to have a heart attack and recommend a course of action. We watch news of Google&#8217;s self-driving cars, but don&#8217;t likely realize this means progressive cities will have to ban human drives in the next decade because us humans are too risky.  Following on from the Industrial or Machine Age, the Space Age and the Digital Age, the Augmented Age will be based on four key disruptive themes &#8211; Artificial Intelligence, Experience Design, Smart Infrastructure, and Health Tech. Historically the previous &#8216;ages&#8217; brought significant disruption and changes, but on a net basis jobs were created, wealth was enhanced, and the health and security of society improved. What will the Augmented Age bring?<br />
                    Will robots take our jobs, and AI&#8217;s subsume us as inferior intelligences, or will this usher in a new age of abundance?  Augmented is a book on future history, but more than that, it is a story about how you will live your life in a world that will change more in the next 20 years than it has in the last 250 years. Are you ready to adapt? Because if history proves anything, you don&#8217;t have much of a choice.    </p>

<p>                    What do Apple, Starbucks, Dyson and Pret a Manger have in common? How do they achieve spectacular growth, leaving behind former tried-and-true brands to gasp their last? The old checklist of P&#8217;s used by marketers &#8211; Pricing, Promotion, Publicity &#8211; aren&#8217;t working anymore. The golden age of advertising is over. It&#8217;s time to add a new P &#8211; the Purple Cow.    </p>
<p>                    Purple Cow describes something phenomenal, something counterintuitive and exciting and flat-out unbelievable. In his new bestseller, Seth Godin urges you to put a Purple Cow into everything you build, and everything you do, to create something truly noticeable. It&#8217;s a manifesto for anyone who wants to help create products and services that are worth marketing in the first place.    </p>
<p>                    If you enjoyed reading this, check out Seth Godin&#8217;s business classic This is Marketing.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A worthy successor to Michael Porter, Bova&#8217;s book is that rare gift: it opens doors for new ideas and new actions. No glib answers here, simply hard-won wisdom that will provoke big changes for organizations large and small.&#8217; &#8211; Seth Godin, author of Linchpin    </p>
<p>                    The Wall Street Journal Top Ten Bestseller: The 10 strategies to sustainable growth, based on a purpose-led culture for organizations large and small.    </p>
<p>                    Tiffani Bova, the Growth and Innovation Evangelist at Salesforce, draws on her expertise as a consultant and practitioner to devise a new framework for business leaders looking to pursue growth. We&#8217;re witnessing an age of endless customization, and growth strategy is no exception. There&#8217;s no one size fits all strategy; a winning strategy for one business may spell doom for another.    </p>
<p>                    In Growth IQ, Bova determines that there are ten simple &#8211; but easily misunderstood &#8211; growth paths, and explains how companies can get a handle on their particular business context, and use it to determine the right combination and sequence of growth paths to take them into the future.     </p>
<p>                    Bova breaks down the strategies deployed by a wide range of companies to show you how:    </p>
<p>                      *  GE and John Deere have lasted over a century and continue to thrive by combining their strategy of innovative product development with a renewed focus on R&#038;D and customer experience.<br />
                      *  Marvel transformed from a struggling comic book publisher to a global entertainment behemoth by realigning their market penetration strategy to focus on comic book characters, instead of just comic books.<br />
                      *  Gateway&#8217;s attempt at market expansion into brick-and-mortar retail led to its failure, while the same move by Apple has accelerated its growth.    </p>
<p>                    Whether your company is on a growth spurt, in a worrying stall, or showing signs of decline, Growth IQ is your map to charting the course of your company&#8217;s future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Create the personalized and compelling experiences that today&#8217;s customers expect by harnessing AI and digital technologies to create smart connected products, with this cutting-edge guide from senior leaders at Accenture.      </p>
<p>                    Digital technology is both friend and foe: highly disruptive, yet it cannot be ignored. As traditional products transform into smart connected products faster than ever before, companies that fail to make use of it now put themselves in the firing line for disintermediation or even eradication.     </p>
<p>                    However, digital technology is also the biggest opportunity for product-making businesses to create the next generation of goods in the marketplace. In Reinventing the Product, Eric Schaeffer and David Sovie, both Senior Managing Directors at Accenture, show how this reinvention is made possible, to deliver truly intelligent, and often even autonomous, products.     </p>
<p>                    Reinventing the Product makes the case for companies to rethink their product strategy, innovation and engineering processes, including:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to harness the opportunities of AI and digital technologies, such as IoT sensors, blockchain, advanced analytics, cloud and edge computing<br />
                    &#8211; Practical advice on transforming their entire culture to build the future of successful &#8216;living products&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Features case studies from global organizations such as Faurecia, Signify, Symmons and Haier and interviews with thought leaders from top companies including Amazon, ABB, Tesla, Samsung and Google    </p>
<p>                    This book provides the only advice any product-making company needs as it embarks on, or accelerates, its digitization journey.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To compete with today&#8217;s increasing globalization and rapidly evolving technologies, individuals and organizations must take their ability to learn-the foundation for continuous improvement, operational excellence, and innovation-to a much higher level. In Learn or Die, Edward D. Hess combines recent advances in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, and education with key research on high-performance businesses to create an actionable blueprint for becoming a leading-edge learning organization. Learn or Die examines the process of learning from an individual and an organizational standpoint. From an individual perspective, the book discusses the cognitive, emotional, motivational, attitudinal, and behavioral factors that promote better learning. Organizationally, Learn or Die focuses on the kinds of structures, culture, leadership, employee learning behaviors, and human resource policies that are necessary to create an environment that enables critical and innovative thinking, learning conversations, and collaboration.<br />
                    The volume also provides strategies to mitigate the reality that humans can be reflexive, lazy thinkers who seek confirmation of what they believe to be true and affirmation of their self-image. Exemplar learning organizations discussed include the secretive Bridgewater Associates, LP; Intuit, Inc.; United Parcel Service (UPS); W. L. Gore &#038; Associates; and IDEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE BUSINESS BOOK AWARDS 2021    </p>
<p>                    In The 4 Day Week, entrepreneur and business innovator Andrew Barnes makes the case for the four-day work week as the answer to many of the ills of the 21st-century global economy.     </p>
<p>                     Barnes conducted an experiment in his own business, the New Zealand trust company Perpetual Guardian, and asked his staff to design a four-day week that would permit them to meet their existing productivity requirements on the same salary but with a 20% cut in work hours. The outcomes of this trial, which no business leader had previously attempted on these terms, were stunning. People were happier and healthier, more engaged in their personal lives, and more focused and productive in the office.    </p>
<p>                     The world of work has seen a dramatic shift in recent times: the former security and benefits associated with permanent employment are being displaced by the less stable gig economy. Barnes explains the dangers of a focus on flexibility at the expense of hard-won worker protections, and argues that with the four-day week, we can have the best of all worlds: optimal productivity, work-life balance, worker benefits and, at long last, a solution to pervasive economic inequities such as the gender pay gap and lack of diversity in business and governance.     </p>
<p>                     The 4 Day Week is a practical, how-to guide for business leaders and employees alike that is applicable to nearly every industry. Using qualitative and quantitative data from research gathered through the Perpetual Guardian trial and other sources by the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology, the book presents a step-by-step approach to preparing businesses for productivity-focused flexibility, from the necessary cultural conditions to the often complex legislative considerations.    </p>
<p>                     The story of Perpetual Guardian&#8217;s unprecedented work experiment has made headlines around the world and stormed social media, reaching a global audience in more than seventy countries. A mix of trenchant analysis, personal observation and actionable advice, The 4 Day Week is an essential guide for leaders and workers seeking to make a change for the better in their work world.</p>

<p>                    Brands are built on trust, but in a post-truth world they&#8217;re faced with a serious challenge: so much of modern life is defined by mistrust. A shattering of the vital trust connection between brands and consumers, together with the evaporation of authenticity as a core brand pillar, is causing enormous problems for businesses on a global scale. If a brand isn&#8217;t seen as trustworthy, then when choice is available it will be rejected in favour of one that is.    </p>
<p>                    The Post-Truth Business provides a way forward for any organization wishing to rebuild brand authenticity in a distrustful world. It explains the interconnected problems facing businesses, with important topics including:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; The impact of fake news, disinformation and the weaponizing of lies<br />
                    &#8211; The safeguarding of privacy, alongside privacy as a tradable asset<br />
                    &#8211; Why and how brands must create communication with meaning<br />
                    &#8211; The dangers of inauthentic cultural marketing activities<br />
                    &#8211; Examples of conscious capitalism and brand activism<br />
                    &#8211; Lessons in authenticity from artisans and innovators<br />
                    &#8211; National branding and reputation capital<br />
                    &#8211; Leveraging the power of &#8216;brand trust&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    The Post-Truth Business shows how to strengthen consumer engagement by closing the &#8216;brand credibility gap&#8217;.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 70 per cent of employees in the UK aren&#8217;t performing at their full potential. At the roots of this problem are the policies and systems built to &#8216;manage&#8217; these employees, which were designed for a different era &#8211; the industrial economy.     </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Jim Collins&#8217; bestselling Good to Great, in Under New Management David Burkus, psychologist, professor of management at the College of Business at Oral Roberts University and author of The Myth of Creativity, shines a light on the companies that are experimenting with new and different models and policies for leading teams and managing people. From Amazon to Virgin, Volkswagen to Whole Foods, these companies have developed a new set of best practices that may look counter-intuitive, but have become an integral part of what makes them so high-performing, and that have established employee engagement and customer loyalty.     </p>
<p>                    The purpose of this book and its research is to challenge you and your company on whether the time has come to re-examine some of the most fundamental concepts in management today. The business of business is all about change and keeping up with the latest trends. Here&#8217;s your chance to see for yourself what kinds of management changes you should be thinking of.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I love this book! If you want a true manifesto, a guidebook with clear signposts, and a fun ride you&#8217;ll return to again and again, you have it here in this book. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did&#8217; Tim Ferriss, author of The 4-Hour Workweek      </p>
<p>                    The iconic manifesto on lessons learned while becoming an entrepreneur    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;    </p>
<p>                    You don&#8217;t need a visionary master plan, loads of funding or a brilliant team to start a business.    </p>
<p>                    When Derek Sivers started CD Baby, he wasn&#8217;t planning on building a major business. He was a successful independent musician who just wanted to sell his CDs online. He started in 1998 by helping his friends sell their CDs too. In 2000, he hired his first employee. Eight years later, he sold CD Baby for $22 million.    </p>
<p>                    Sivers didn&#8217;t need a business plan and neither do you. You don&#8217;t need to think big; in fact, it&#8217;s better if you don&#8217;t. Anything You Want will inspire you to start with what you have, care about your customers more than yourself, and run your business like you don&#8217;t need the money.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Some of the best hours you&#8217;ll ever spend will be reading Derek Sivers&#8217;s new book&#8230;Anything You Want&#8217; Forbes</p>

Next, the authors detail a clear-cut business model to help leaders take part in this coming boom; the AHEAD model outlines five strategic initiatives Automate, Halos, Enhance, Abundance, and Discovery that are central to competing in the next phase of global business by driving new levels of efficiency, customer intimacy and innovation. Business leaders today have two options: be swallowed up by the ongoing technological evolution, or ride the crest of the wave to new profits and better business. This book shows you how to avoid your own extinction event, and will help you; * Understand the untold full extent of technology&#8217;s impact on the way we work and live.<br />
                    * Find out where we&#8217;re headed, and how soon the future will arrive * Leverage the new emerging paradigm into a sustainable business advantage * Adopt a strategic model for winning in the new economy The digital world is already transforming how we work, live, and shop, how we are governed and entertained, and how we manage our money, health, security, and relationships. Don&#8217;t let your business or your career get left behind. What To Do When Machines Do Everything is your strategic roadmap to a future full of possibility and success. Or peril.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies, communities, and individuals fall for many reasons, but one of the most common and easily avoidable is the failure to reinvent. When people and organizations rest on prior successes rather than driving purposeful transformation, they discover too late that they have lost their market position altogether to competitors and external forces. The most successful companies, brands, and individuals make reinvention a regular part of their business strategies. Transformation demands an ongoing process of discovery and imagination, and The Road to Reinvention lays out a systematic approach for continually challenging and reinventing yourself and your business. Venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur Josh Linkner identifies six elements in any business that are ripe for reinvention and shares examples, methods, and step-by-step techniques for creating deliberate, productive disruption. Throughout The Road to Reinvention, Linkner also explores the history the great rise, unprecedented fall, and now rebirth of his beloved hometown, Detroit.<br />
                    First rising to greatness as the result of breathtaking innovation, Detroit had generations of booming growth before succumbing to apathy, atrophy, and finally bankruptcy. Now, the city is rising from the ashes and driving sustainable success through an intense focus on reinvention. Linkner brings an insider&#8217;s view of this incredible story of grit, determination, and creativity, sharing his perspective on Detroit&#8217;s successes and setbacks as a profound example of large-scale organizational and personal transformation. Change is inevitable. You need to decide: Will you drive that change, or be driven away by it? Will you disrupt or be disrupted? By choosing to deliberately reimagine your own status quo, you can secure a strong future for both your company and your career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Jugaad Innovation is the most comprehensive book yet to appear on the subject [of frugal innovation].&#8221; The Economist A frugal and flexible approach to innovation for the 21st century Innovation is a key directive at companies worldwide. But in these tough times, we can&#8217;t rely on the old formula that has sustained innovation efforts for decades expensive R&#038;D projects and highly-structured innovation processes. Jugaad Innovation argues the West must look to places like India, Brazil, and China for a new approach to frugal and flexible innovation. The authors show how in these emerging markets, jugaad (a Hindi word meaning an improvised solution born from ingenuity and cleverness) is leading to dramatic growth and how Western companies can adopt jugaad innovation to succeed in our hypercompetitive world.<br />
                    * Outlines the six principles of jugaad innovation: Seek opportunity in adversity, do more with less, think and act flexibly, keep it simple, include the margin, and follow your heart * Features twenty case studies on large corporations from around the world Google, Facebook, 3M, Apple, Best Buy, GE, IBM, Nokia, Procter &#038; Gamble, PepsiCo, Tata Group, and more that are actively practicing jugaad innovation * The authors blog regularly at Harvard Business Review; their work has been profiled in BusinessWeek, MIT Sloan Management Review, The Financial Times, The Economist, and more * Filled with previously untold and engaging stories of resourceful jugaad innovators and entrepreneurs in emerging markets and the United States This groundbreaking book shows leaders everywhere why the time is right for jugaad to emerge as a powerful business tool in the West and how to bring jugaad practices to their organizations.</p>

<p>                    In the vein of Susan Cain&#8217;s QUIET and Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s DAVID AND GOLIATH, HOW TO FLY A HORSE is a smart, empowering book that dispels the myths around genius and creativity.    </p>
<p>                    There is a myth about how something new comes to be; that geniuses have dramatic moments of insight where great things and thoughts are born whole. Symphonies are composed complete. Science is accomplished with eureka shrieks. Businesses are built by magic touch.    </p>
<p>                    The myth is wrong. Anyone can create.     </p>
<p>                    Acclaimed technology pioneer Kevin Ashton takes us behind the scenes of creation to reveal the true process of discovery and how &#8216;new&#8217; comes to be. From Archimedes to Apple, from Kandinsky to the Coke can, from the Wright brothers &#8211; who set out to &#8216;fly a horse&#8217; &#8211; to Woody Allen, he exposes the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures and countless ordinary and often uncredited acts that led to our most astounding breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will the workplace of the future be overrun by machines and robots? Are the new frontiers of artificial intelligence (AI) on the cusp of dethroning us in efficiency, intelligence and innovative potential? Automation and AI will augment our human world and potential.     </p>
<p>                    The winners of the future of work are those that harness the power of machines to their advantage. Human/Machine is the only guide you need to understand the fourth industrial revolution. It sets out a road map to the challenges ahead, but also unlocks the wondrous opportunities that it offers.     </p>
<p>                    Human/Machine explores how we will work symbiotically with machines, detailing how institutions, companies, individuals and education providers will evolve to integrate seamlessly with new technologies. With exclusive case studies, this book offers a glimpse into the future and details how top companies are already thriving on this very special relationship. From gamification in job training to project management teams integrated with bots and predictive technologies that fix problems in the supply chain before they happen, the authors deliver a powerful manifesto for the adoption and celebration of automation and AI. In a much more fluid, skills-based economy, we will all need to prove our worth and future-proof our skills base. This book offers a blueprint to avoid being left behind and unearth the opportunities unique to human-machine partnership ecosystems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The bible for bringing cutting-edge products to larger markets&#8211;now revised and updated with new insights into the realities of high-tech marketing    </p>
<p>                    In Crossing the Chasm, Geoffrey A. Moore shows that in the Technology Adoption Life Cycle&#8211;which begins with innovators and moves to early adopters, early majority, late majority, and laggards&#8211;there is a vast chasm between the early adopters and the early majority. While early adopters are willing to sacrifice for the advantage of being first, the early majority waits until they know that the technology actually offers improvements in productivity. The challenge for innovators and marketers is to narrow this chasm and ultimately accelerate adoption across every segment.     </p>
<p>                    This third edition brings Moore&#8217;s classic work up to date with dozens of new examples of successes and failures, new strategies for marketing in the digital world, and Moore&#8217;s most current insights and findings. He also includes two new appendices, the first connecting the ideas in Crossing the Chasm to work subsequently published in his Inside the Tornado, and the second presenting his recent groundbreaking work for technology adoption models for high-tech consumer markets.</p>

<p>                    Many companies are good at acquiring new product prototypes but bad at working out what they would do when they arrived at the front door. Many just give up, lacking the &#8216;How&#8217; to go with the &#8216;Wow&#8217;. Using a unique two-sided approach to innovation involving both the Money and the Magic and in the process turning traditional orthodoxies about brainstorming on their head, Mark Payne reveals how to explore every potential idea with the end goal in mind-bringing an innovative product to market in a way that will transform a company&#8217;s business and growth.</p>

<p>                    Aaron Dignan teaches companies how to eliminate red tape, tap into collective intelligence, and rethink long-held traditions that no longer make sense. In Brave New Work, he shows you how to revolutionize the way you, your team and your company works forever.     </p>
<p>                    *         Have fewer but better meetings<br />
                    *         Create a culture of honesty, transparency and trust<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Be Fearless is researched-based call to action for those seeking to live extraordinary lives and bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    LOS ANGELES TIMES BESTSELLER * NATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Weaving together storytelling, practical tips and inspiration, the book will teach you how to put the five fearless principles to work so that you too can spark the sorts of remarkable breakthroughs that can impact the world. Philanthropist, investor, and technology pioneer Jean Case brings to life the five Be Fearless principles common to the people and organizations that bring about transformational change.    </p>
<p>                    When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found five surprising traits they all had in common. These weren&#8217;t wealth, privilege, or even genius. What all of these exceptional men and women shared was that they had chosen to make a &#8220;big bet,&#8221; take bold risks, learn from their failures, reach beyond their bubbles, and let urgency conquer fear.    </p>
<p>                    Throughout Be Fearless, Jean vividly illustrates these principles through storytelling-from her own transformational life experiences, to Jane Goodall&#8217;s remarkable breakthroughs in understanding and protecting chimpanzees, to celebrity chef Jose Andres&#8217; decision to be a &#8220;first responder&#8221; and take his kitchen to the sites of devastating hurricanes to feed the hungry, to Madame C.J. Walker&#8217;s vision to build a hair care empire that would employ thousands across the country, and more. She shares new insights to stories you might think you know-like Airbnb&#8217;s tale of starting from scratch to transform the hospitality industry, to John F. Kennedy&#8217;s history-making moonshot-and gems from changemakers you&#8217;ve never heard of. Be Fearless features a compelling foreword from Jane Goodall saying &#8220;there is no time in history when it has been more important to Be Fearless&#8221; and a new afterword with stories of people inspired to take action after reading the book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DISTINGUISHED FAVOURITE: Independent Press Award 2020 &#8211; Business General Category<br />
                    WINNER: CES 2020 Gary&#8217;s Book Club Top Technology Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the new electricity of our times. It is revolutionizing industries the world over, and changing how we fundamentally view and understand work. Superhuman Innovation argues that AI will supercharge the workforce and the world of work, can be harnessed to deliver powerful change to how companies innovate and gain competitive advantage. It is a practical guide to how AI and Machine Learning are impacting not only how businesses, brands, and agencies innovate, but also what they innovate: products, services and content.     </p>
<p>                    In a world of product and pricing parity, the delivery of superior service experience has become the new marketing, and the new real competitive edge. With AI companies can harness the power of data, personalization and on-demand availability, at the touch of an intelligent button. Superhuman Innovation discusses how AI will serve the superstar innovators of tomorrow, by enabling them to see deeper insights and set sail for higher goals. It unearths a powerful five-pronged model which describes how AI enables innovation through the offerings of Speed (facilitating work processes), Understanding (revealing and mastering deep insights), Performance (customization of delivery to customers), Experimentation (the iterative process of reinvention and feedback) and Results (tangible, measurable and optimizable results). The book is supported by varied and innovative case studies from a variety of industries.</p>

<p>                    What is the best way for a company to innovate? Advice recommending &#8220;innovation vacations&#8221; and the luxury of failure may be wonderful for organizations with time to spend and money to waste. The Innovator&#8217;s Hypothesis addresses the innovation priorities of companies that live in the real world of limits. Michael Schrage advocates a cultural and strategic shift: small teams, collaboratively&#8211;and competitively&#8211;crafting business experiments that make top management sit up and take notice. He introduces the 5&#215;5 framework: giving diverse teams of five people up to five days to come up with portfolios of five business experiments costing no more than $5,000 each and taking no longer than five weeks to run. Successful 5x5s, Schrage shows, make people more effective innovators, and more effective innovators mean more effective innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early in the twenty-first century, a quiet revolution occurred. For the first time, the major developed economies began to invest more in intangible assets, like design, branding, and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers. For all sorts of businesses, the ability to deploy assets that one can neither see nor touch is increasingly the main source of long-term success. But this is not just a familiar story of the so-called new economy. Capitalism without Capital shows that the growing importance of intangible assets has also played a role in some of the larger economic changes of the past decade, including the growth in economic inequality and the stagnation of productivity. Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake explore the unusual economic characteristics of intangible investment and discuss how an economy rich in intangibles is fundamentally different from one based on tangibles. Capitalism without Capital concludes by outlining how managers, investors, and policymakers can exploit the characteristics of an intangible age to grow their businesses, portfolios, and economies.</p>

<p>                    An adrenaline-fuelled expose of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio Garcia Martinez, this is Liar&#8217;s Poker meets The Social Network.     </p>
<p>                    Computer engineers use &#8216;chaos monkey&#8217; software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio Garcia Martinez are society&#8217;s chaos monkeys &#8211; their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) &#8211; all in search of the perfect business miracle.      </p>
<p>                    Describing himself as &#8216;high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times&#8217;, Garcia Martinez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook&#8217;s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users&#8217; data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark &#8216;Zuck&#8217; Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, Garcia Martinez  took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg&#8217;s desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.    </p>
<p>                    In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW &#8211; and HOW NOT &#8211; to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing.  Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, Garcia Martinez  unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital &#8216;privacy&#8217;, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How many presentations on innovation have there been recently? Thousands? Millions? We are experiencing &#8216;innovation fatigue&#8217;: we feel cheated by the endless rounds of consultants who come into our organizations, deliver conceptual models that don&#8217;t stick with the realities of business and then leave again. Companies and teams are left feeling more deflated than before, and with not one idea that&#8217;s impacted the bottom line. Innovation for the Fatigued argues it is worth fighting for the concept and study of innovation in organizations.    </p>
<p>                    Business leaders are always looking over their shoulders for the next Uber moment to overtake them, and they recognize that innovation needs to be a top priority. But how does one innovate? This book is the antidote to the empty promises that pervade the innovation industry. By designing a company culture that nurtures ideas, but also defends against incrementalism and fads, we can rediscover the powerful basics of imagination, empathy, play and courage, which are all instrumental in delivering real impactful innovation. Innovation for the Fatigued will detail where companies have got innovation wrong, whilst celebrating and studying the ones that lead the way. With unique, relatable and varied examples, renowned innovation and creativity professor Alf Rehn provides a practical model for getting innovation back on track, and instilling change at speed with real concern for market demands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Change is the only constant.  Learn to be a change-maker.    </p>
<p>                    In Imagine It Forward, Beth Comstock, the former vice chair of GE, describes her twenty-five year efforts to be an instigator of change at every level of business. When she first moved from NBC to parent company GE in 1998, she was ignored as a woman in a man&#8217;s world, treated as an outsider because she didn&#8217;t have a business background, and ignored as a mere PR person. But CEO Jeff Immelt realized even then that the industrial giant, like so many businesses, had to change fast in order to stay relevant in a world where Google, Facebook, and an explosion of internet companies were transforming how goods and services were marketed, made, and sold.    </p>
<p>                    In a deeply personal journey filled with practical takeaways from two plus decades of initiating change at the top levels of one of the largest corporations in the world, Comstock lays out the challenges, opportunities, tools, and practices needed to embrace change, whatever industry you are in, and make it part of every management decision.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you know how to find out what people really want to buy? (Not what you think they want, not what they say they want, but what they really want?)    </p>
<p>                    The secret is asking the right questions&#8230; and the right questions are not what you might expect.    </p>
<p>                    Introducing Ask: the most powerful way to discover exactly what people want to buy, and how to give it to them &#8211; and in a way that makes people fall in love with you and your company.     </p>
<p>                    The proven, repeatable (yet slightly counterintuitive) Ask Method has quietly generated over $100 million in online sales across 23 different industries, and counting. In this tell-all book, Ryan Levesque reveals this exact method step-by-step, as well as the unusual story behind its discovery.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you&#8217;re an aspiring Internet entrepreneur, advanced online marketer, or established business owner, this book will both inspire you and show you how to skyrocket your online income-while creating a mass of raving fans in the process-simply by asking the right questions in a surprisingly different way.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Ryan has uncovered some enormous misunderstandings about human buying behavior and then utilized his neuroscience background to create this game-changing marketing and survey strategy. Before you finish the first third of the book, you&#8217;ll be eager to jump ahead and implement his process immediately &#8211; it&#8217;s that powerful!&#8217; &#8211; Annie Hyman Pratt, former CEO of The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and CEO of IMPAQ Entrepreneur Business Execution Systems    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Ask may be the most important book written for anyone who sells products or services directly to consumers since Breakthrough Advertising was published in 1966. Like that masterpiece, Ask gives us a new paradigm for understanding human behavior at the deepest level, which gives rise to a more intelligent and profitable way to sell almost anything. Ryan Levsque will go down in history as the marketer who used his background to change the way products and services are sold online.&#8217; &#8211; Brian Kurtz, business builder of Boardroom Inc. and serial direct marketer</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Robin Chase cofounded Zipcar, she not only started a business but established the foundation for one of the most important economic and social ideas of our time: the collaborative economy. With this important audiobook, she broadens our thinking about the ways in which the economy is being transformed and shows how the Peers Inc model is changing the very nature of capitalism.     </p>
<p>                    When the best of people power is combined with the best of corporate power to form &#8220;Peers Inc&#8221; organizations, a potent creative force is released. The &#8220;Inc&#8221; in these collaborations delivers the industrial strengths of significant scale and resources, and the &#8220;Peers&#8221; bring together the individual strengths of localization, specialization, and customization, unlocking the power of the collaborative economy. When excess capacity is harnessed by the platform and diverse peers participate, a completely new dynamic is unleashed.     </p>
<p>                    In Peers Inc, Robin Chase brings her provocative insights to work, business, the economy, and the environment, showing: How focusing on excess capacity transforms the economics of what&#8217;s possible and delivers abundance to all How the new collaboration between the Inc and the Peers enables companies to grow more quickly, learn faster, and deliver smarter products and services How leveraging the Peers Inc model can address climate change with the necessary speed and scale How the Peers Inc model can help legacy companies overcome their shortening life cycle by inviting innovation and evolution Why power parity between the Peers and the Inc is a prerequisite for long-term success How platforms can be built within the existing financial system or outside of it What government can do to enhance economic possibility and protect people working in this new decentralized world</p>

<p>                    It&#8217;s easy to imagine a frightening future in which technology takes over the jobs that we now get paid to do, working more accurately and for barely any cost. Computers can already perform surgery, drive vehicles, write articles and do intricate legal work, so what hope will there be for tomorrow&#8217;s workforce?    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on a wealth of research, Geoff Colvin uncovers the skills that will be in great demand as technology advances &#8211; and how they can be developed. In this new machine age, we shouldn&#8217;t try to beat computers at what they can do. We&#8217;ll lose that contest. Instead we must look to unlikely places, learn from the best, and cultivate the human abilities that make us unique.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A great idea isn&#8217;t a sudden light-bulb moment. It&#8217;s taking something familiar and making it feel new.     </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;ve been told a lie about the nature of creativity.    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re told stories about creative geniuses &#8211; the young Mozart who effortlessly overshadows the hardworking Salieri; Paul McCartney coming up with the tune for Yesterday in a dream one morning; JK Rowling finding inspiration for Harry Potter sitting on a train to London.  What we aren&#8217;t told is the actual story behind such hits.  In fact there is a science and method for mainstream success, whether writing a popular novel, starting a company or creating an effective marketing campaign, and in this book Allen Gannett &#8211; data wizard and successful entrepreneur &#8211; reveals the four laws of creativity that are proven to work.    </p>
<p>                    New ideas are surprising at first, and slowly become familiar as we get used to them.  Allan Gannett reveals there&#8217;s a sweet spot between what feels familiar and safe to us, and what is innovative and new: the point of optimal tension between safety and surprise, similarity and difference.  The people we think of as creative geniuses are people who understand this sweet spot instinctively; they know what people find familiar and reassuring, and they find ways to reinvent it fresh.    </p>
<p>                    Packed with stories and insights ranging from the team behind Dear Evan Hansen to the founder of Reddit, from the Chief Content Officer of Netflix to Michelin starred chefs, The Creative Curve will help you spend less time on ideas destined to fail and more time on ideas that really break out. This book is for everyone, whether you&#8217;re a business leader, a creative artist or a budding entrepreneur &#8211; and will teach you the secret to conceiving great ideas that can achieve major success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s no longer enough to create great new products; rather companies now must create whole new categories that destroy old ones. Uber created a new personal transportation category and destroyed taxis and limos. Salesforce.com created a new category of cloud-base sales automation, dethroning the old CRM industry. Airbnb, Workday, Tesla and Netflix are all winning by creating entirely new business categories that destabilise old ones.    </p>
<p>                    The category is the new strategy.    </p>
<p>                    The conclusion: If you want to build a legendary company, you need to design and build a legendary category at the same time, and dominate it over time. Your company needs to be a Category King. And if you don&#8217;t design a Category King, you&#8217;re creating a failure.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on examples from within and beyond our own practice, PLAY BIGGER shows both entrepreneurs and established enterprises how to define, develop and rule a category over time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often downplayed in the excitement of starting up a new business venture is one of the most important decisions entrepreneurs will face: should they go it alone, or bring in cofounders, hires, and investors to help build the business? More than just financial rewards are at stake. Friendships and relationships can suffer. Bad decisions at the inception of a promising venture lay the foundations for its eventual ruin. The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas is the first book to examine the early decisions by entrepreneurs that can make or break a startup and its team. Drawing on a decade of research, Noam Wasserman reveals the common pitfalls founders face and how to avoid them. He looks at whether it is a good idea to cofound with friends or relatives, how and when to split the equity within the founding team, and how to recognize when a successful founder-CEO should exit or be fired. Wasserman explains how to anticipate, avoid, or recover from disastrous mistakes that can splinter a founding team, strip founders of control, and leave founders without a financial payoff for their hard work and innovative ideas.<br />
                    He highlights the need at each step to strike a careful balance between controlling the startup and attracting the best resources to grow it, and demonstrates why the easy short-term choice is often the most perilous in the long term. The Founder&#8217;s Dilemmas draws on the inside stories of founders like Evan Williams of Twitter and Tim Westergren of Pandora, while mining quantitative data on almost ten thousand founders. People problems are the leading cause of failure in startups. This book offers solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antoine van Agtmael coined the term &#8220;emerging markets&#8221; and built a career and a multibillion-dollar investing firm centered on these surging economies that would, over time, supplant the West as engines of wealth and prosperity. The trend held for decades, but a few years ago van Agtmael and Alfred Bakker, a renowned European journalist, began seeing signs that the tide might be turning. For example, during a visit to an enormously successful chip company in Taiwan, the company&#8217;s leaders told them that their American competitors were now eating their lunch. And Taiwan was not the only place giving them this message.    </p>
<p>                    Thus began a remarkable two-year journey to reassess the conventional wisdom that the United States and Europe are yesterday&#8217;s story and to determine whether there something profound is happening that points the way to the creation of the next economy.     </p>
<p>                    In The Smartest Places on Earth, van Agtmael and Bakker present a truly hopeful and inspiring investigation into the emerging sources of a new era of competitiveness for America and Europe that are coming from unlikely places&#8211;those cities and areas once known as &#8220;rustbelts&#8221; that have, from an economic perspective, been written off. Take Akron, Ohio, whose economy for decades was dependent on industries such as tire manufacturing, a product now made cheaply elsewhere. In Akron and other such communities, a combination of forces&#8211;including visionary thinkers, government initiatives, start-ups making real products, and even big corporations&#8211;have succeeded in creating what van Agtmael and Bakker call a &#8220;brainbelt.&#8221; These brainbelts depend on a collaborative work style that is unique to the societies and culture of America and Europe, since they involve levels of trust and freedom of thinking that can&#8217;t be replicated elsewhere. They are producing products and technologies that are transforming industries such as vehicles and transportation, farming and food production, medical devices and health care.    </p>
<p>                    For several decades, American and European industry focused on cost by outsourcing production to those emerging markets that can make things cheaper. The tide has now turned toward being smart, as van Agtmael and Bakker report, and the next emerging market, may, in fact, be the West.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this book, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum contribute significantly to one of the most important issues of our time &#8211; how to move forward in the Fourth Industrial Revolution&#8217; Jack Ma, Executive Chairman, Alibaba Group Holding, People&#8217;s Republic of China    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s no secret that technologies are reshaping the world&#8217;s economies and societies. To manage the risks and spread the benefits, we have to act now, and in the interest of stakeholders everywhere&#8217; Andrew McAfee, Co-Founder, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, MIT, USA    </p>
<p>                    We are on the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. And this one will be unlike any other in human history.    </p>
<p>                    Characterized by new technologies fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will impact all disciplines, economies and industries &#8211; and it will do so at an unprecedented rate. World Economic Forum data predicts that by 2025 we will see: commercial use of nanomaterials 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than human hair; the first transplant of a 3D-printed liver; 10% of all cars on US roads being driverless; and much more besides.    </p>
<p>                    In The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Schwab outlines the key technologies driving this revolution, discusses the major impacts on governments, businesses, civil society and individuals, and offers bold ideas for what can be done to shape a better future for all.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are extraordinary. Leadership has to be equally extraordinary to manage the complexities of systemic change&#8217; Eric Schmidt, Technical Advisor, Alphabet, USA</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The subject of &#8220;design thinking&#8221; is the rage at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to the work of IDEO, a leading design firm, and its celebrated CEO, Tim Brown, who uses this book to show how the techniques and strategies of design belong at every level of business.    </p>
<p>                    The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design explains design thinking, the collaborative process by which the designer&#8217;s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people&#8217;s needs, not only with what is technically feasible, but what is viable to the bottom line. Design thinking converts need into demand. It&#8217;s a human-centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.     </p>
<p>                    Introduced a decade ago, the concept of design thinking remains popular at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to work of IDEO, the undisputed world leading strategy, innovation, and design firm headed by Tim Brown. As he makes clear in this visionary guide-now updated with addition material, including new case studies, and a new introduction-design thinking is not just applicable to so-called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It&#8217;s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente, to increase the quality of patient care by re-examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change, or Kraft, to rethink supply chain management.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design is not a book by designers for designers; it is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization, product, or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to get past the most common myths about creativity to design truly innovative strategies We tend to think of creativity in terms reminiscent of the ancient muses: divinely-inspired, unpredictable, and bestowed upon a lucky few. But when our jobs challenge us to be creative on demand, we must develop novel, useful ideas that will keep our organizations competitive. The Myths of Creativity demystifies the processes that drive innovation. Based on the latest research into how creative individuals and firms succeed, David Burkus highlights the mistaken ideas that hold us back and shows us how anyone can embrace a practical approach, grounded in reality, to finding the best new ideas, projects, processes, and programs. * Answers questions such as: What causes us to be creative in one moment and void in the next? What makes someone more or less creative than his or her peers? Where do our flashes of creative insight come from, and how can we generate more of them?<br />
                    * Debunks 10 common myths, including: the Eureka Myth; the Lone Creator Myth; the Incentive Myth; and The Brainstorming Myth * Written by David Burkus, founder of popular leadership blog LDRLB For anyone who struggles with creativity, or who makes excuses for delaying the work of innovation, The Myths of Creativity will help you overcome your obstacles to finding new ideas.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times Bestseller named one of the &#8220;Most Important Books of 2016&#8221; by Inc, and a Forbes 2016 &#8220;Must Read Business Book&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you love &#8216;Bones&#8217; and &#8216;CSI&#8217;, this book is your kind of candy&#8217; Paco Underhill, author of Why We Buy    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Martin&#8217;s best book to date. A personal, intuitive, powerful way to look at making an impact with your work&#8217; Seth Godin, author of Purple Cow    </p>
<p>                    Martin Lindstrom, one of Time Magazine&#8217;s 100 Most Influential People in The World and a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, harnesses the power of &#8220;small data&#8221; in his quest to discover the next big thing.    </p>
<p>                    In an era where many believe Big Data has rendered human perception and observation &#8216;old-school&#8217; or passe, Martin Lindstrom shows that mining and matching technological data with up-close psychological insight creates the ultimate snapshot of who we really are and what we really want. He works like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, accumulating small clues &#8211; the progressively weaker handshakes of Millenials, a notable global decrease in the use of facial powder, a change in how younger consumers approach eating ice cream cones &#8211; to help solve a stunningly diverse array of challenges. In Switzerland, a stuffed teddy bear in a teenage girl&#8217;s bedroom helped revolutionise 1,000 stores &#8211; spread across twenty countries &#8211; for one of Europe&#8217;s largest fashion retailers. In Dubai, a distinctive bracelet strung with pearls helped Jenny Craig offset its declining membership in the United States and increase loyalty by 159% in only one year. In China, the look of a car dashboard led to the design of the iRobot, or Roomba, floor cleaner &#8211; a great success story.    </p>
<p>                    SMALL DATA combines armchair travel with forensic psychology in an interlocking series of international clue-gathering detective stories. It shows Lindstrom using his proprietary CLUES Framework &#8211; where big data is merely one part of the overall puzzle &#8211; to get radically close to consumers and come up with the counter-intuitive insights that have in some cases helped transform entire industries.     </p>
<p>                    SMALL DATA presents a rare behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create global brands, and reveals surprising and counter-intuitive truths about what connects us all as humans.</p>

<p>                    20th  July 1969: Neil Armstrong becomes the first person to walk on the Moon.  We all recognize this to be one of mankind&#8217;s greatest achievements. Yet  what did it take to make John F. Kennedy&#8217;s dream a reality?    </p>
<p>                    In  this remarkable book, Professor Richard Wiseman presents a pioneering  study of the mindset that took humanity to the Moon, and shows how you  can harness and use it to achieve the extraordinary in your everyday  life.    </p>
<p>                    Combining personal interviews, mission archives and  cutting-edge psychology, Wiseman embarks on the ultimate voyage through  inner space. Along the way he identifies eight key principles that make  up the Apollo Mindset, including how pessimism is crucial to success,  and how fear and tragedy can be transformed into hope and optimism.     </p>
<p>                    You  will discover a series of practical techniques that you can use to  incorporate these winning principles into both your professional and  personal life.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The basis for a major documentary, two leading experts sound an urgent call for the radical reimagining of American education so we can equip students for the realities of the twenty-first-century economy.<br />
                         We prize academic achievement, pressuring our children to get into the &#8220;right&#8221; colleges, have the highest GPAs, and pursue advanced degrees. But while students may graduate with credentials, by and large they lack the competencies needed to be thoughtful, engaged citizens and to get good jobs in our rapidly evolving economy. Alarmingly, our methods of schooling crush the creativity and initiative young people really need to thrive in the twenty-first century.<br />
                         Now bestselling author and education expert Tony Wagner and venture capitalist Ted Dintersmith call for a complete overhaul of American schools, sharing insights and stories from the front lines. Their powerful, urgent message identifies the growing gap between credentials and competence-and offers a framework for change.<br />
                        Most Likely to Succeed presents a new vision of American education, one that puts wonder, creativity, and initiative at the very heart of the learning process and prepares students for today&#8217;s economy.</p>
