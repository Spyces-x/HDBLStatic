										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional journalist and amateur drinker Bianca Bosker didn&#8217;t know much about wine &#8211; until she discovered the world of elite sommeliers who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of flavour. Astounded by their fervour and seemingly superhuman sensory powers, she set out to uncover what drove their obsession, and whether she, too, could become a &#8216;cork dork.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    With boundless curiosity, humour and a healthy dose of scepticism, Bosker takes the reader inside underground tasting groups, exclusive New York City restaurants, California mass-market wine factories and even a neuroscientist&#8217;s fMRI machine as she attempts to answer the most nagging question of all: what&#8217;s the big deal about wine?     </p>
<p>                    Funny, counterintuitive and compulsively readable, Cork Dork not only illuminates wine production and consumption, but also shows how cultivating our taste buds can have enormous ramifications for both our brains and our lives.</p>
