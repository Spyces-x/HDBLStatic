					<description><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;We think of English as a fortress to be defended, but a better analogy is to think of English as a child.

We love and nurture it into being, and once it gains gross motor skills, it starts going exactly where we don&#8217;t want it to go: it heads right for the goddamned electrical sockets.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                     With wit and irreverence, lexicographer Kory Stamper cracks open the obsessive world of dictionary writing, from the agonizing decisions about what to define and how to do it to the knotty questions of ever-changing word usage.     </p>
<p>                     Filled with fun facts&#8211;for example, the first documented usage of &#8220;OMG&#8221; was in a letter to Winston Churchill&#8211;and Stamper&#8217;s own stories from the linguistic front lines (including how she became America&#8217;s foremost &#8220;irregardless&#8221; apologist, despite loathing the word), Word by Word is an endlessly entertaining look at the wonderful complexities and eccentricities of the English language.</p>

<p>                    Only Bill Bryson could make a book about the English language so entertaining. With his boundless enthusiasm and restless eye for the absurd, this is his astonishing tour of English. From its mongrel origins to its status as the world&#8217;s most-spoken tongue; its apparent simplicity to its deceptive complexity; its vibrant swearing to its uncertain spelling and pronunciation, Bryson covers all this as well as the many curious eccentricities that make it as maddening to learn as it is flexible to use.     </p>
<p>                    Bill Bryson&#8217;s classic Mother Tongue is a highly readable and hilarious tale of how English came to be the world&#8217;s language.</p>
