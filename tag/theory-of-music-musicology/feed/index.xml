										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Simply one of the best pieces of rock reportage ever written.&#8221; (Los Angeles Review of Books)    </p>
<p>                    As a pioneering rock journalist for Hit Parader, Vogue, Saturday Review, and other publications, Ellen Sander had a backstage pass to the hottest music scenes of the 1960s. In this feast of juicy anecdotes and keen social commentary, she draws upon her professional and personal experiences to chronicle pop culture&#8217;s highs and lows during the turbulent decade. Join her for weird and wild road trips with companions ranging from Yippies to the members of Led Zeppelin. Stops along the way include the folk-music clubs of Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury in its riotous heyday, and the euphoric festivals at Monterey and Woodstock.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;It is a memoir, a sourcebook, and a love letter,&#8221; Sander writes, &#8220;a recollection of a time, parenthesized by ambivalence and apathy, a search for the ultimate high, a generation with an irrepressible vision, its art, artists, its audience, and the substance of its statement.&#8221; This expanded edition of Trips adds &#8220;The Plaster Casters of Chicago&#8221;, Sander&#8217;s seminal piece on groupie culture, the lengthy &#8220;Concerts and Conversations&#8221;, as well as a new preface and chapter postscripts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of The Changing Mind and The Organized Mind comes The New York Times bestseller which unravels the mystery of our perennial love affair with music    </p>
<p>                    *****    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;What do the music of Bach, Depeche Mode and John Cage fundamentally have in common?&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Music is an obsession at the heart of human nature, even more fundamental to our species than language.     </p>
<p>                    From Mozart to the Beatles, neuroscientist, psychologist and internationally-bestselling author Daniel Levitin reveals the role of music in human evolution, shows how our musical preferences begin to form even before we are born and explains why music can offer such an emotional experience.    </p>
<p>                    In This Is Your Brain On Music Levitin offers nothing less than a new way to understand music, and what it can teach us about ourselves.     </p>
<p>                    *****    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Music seems to have an almost wilful, evasive quality, defying simple explanation, so that the more we find out, the more there is to know . . . Daniel Levitin&#8217;s book is an eloquent and poetic exploration of this paradox&#8217; Sting    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;You&#8217;ll never hear music in the same way again&#8217; Classic FM magazine    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Music, Levitin argues, is not a decadent modern diversion but something of fundamental importance to the history of human development&#8217; Literary Review</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Music Works is David Byrne&#8217;s bestselling, buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. Drawing on his own work over the years with Talking Heads, Brian Eno, and his myriad collaborators &#8211; along with journeys to Wagnerian opera houses, African villages, and anywhere music exists &#8211; Byrne shows how music emerges from cultural circumstance as much as individual creativity. It is his magnum opus, and an impassioned argument about music&#8217;s liberating, life-affirming power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But sound has surprising power to influence our decisions, opinions, and actions in ways we might not even notice. Discordant ambient noise can induce anxiety; ice cream truck jingles can bring you back to your childhood. In The Sonic Boom, strategic sound consultant Joel Beckerman provides a new framework for thinking about sound effects on every aspect of our lives. You don&#8217;t need to be a musician or a composer to harness the power of sound. Whether you&#8217;re a corporate giant connecting with millions of customers or a teacher connecting with one classroom of students, the key to an effective sonic strategy is the creation of &#8220;boom moments&#8221; transcendent instants when sound connects with a listener&#8217;s emotional core.</p>
