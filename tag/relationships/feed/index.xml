										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Set in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine     </p>
<p>                    #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King&#8217;s timeless novella &#8220;The Body&#8221;&#8211;originally published in his 1982 short story collection Different Seasons, and adapted into the 1986 film classic Stand by Me&#8211;is now available as a stand-alone publication.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s 1960 in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. Ray Brower, a boy from a nearby town, has disappeared, and twelve-year-old Gordie Lachance and his three friends set out on a quest to find his body along the railroad tracks. During the course of their journey, Gordie, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio come to terms with death and the harsh truths of growing up in a small factory town that doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of a future.     </p>
<p>                    A timeless exploration of the loneliness and isolation of young adulthood, Stephen King&#8217;s The Body is an iconic, unforgettable, coming-of-age story.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD</p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.</p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.</p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.</p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

<p>                    Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper may not be the prettiest girl in her high school, but she has a loyal group of friends, a biting wit, and a spot-on BS detector. She&#8217;s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush, who calls Bianca the Duff&#8211;the Designated Ugly Fat Friend&#8211;of her crew.     </p>
<p>                    But things aren&#8217;t so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him.     </p>
<p>                    Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn&#8217;t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she&#8217;s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.</p>
