										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In  Economic Facts and Fallacies , Thomas Sowell exposes some of the most popular fallacies about economic issues in a lively manner that does not require any prior knowledge of economics. These fallacies include many beliefs widely disseminated in the media and by politicians, such as fallacies about urban problems, income differences, male-female economic differences, as well as economic fallacies about academia, about race, and about Third World countries. Sowell shows that fallacies are not simply crazy ideas but in fact have a certain plausibility that gives them their staying power- and makes careful examination of their flaws both necessary and important.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who is the richest person in the world, ever? Does where you were born affect how much money you&#8217;ll earn over a lifetime? How would we know? Why- beyond the idle curiosity- do these questions even matter? In  The Haves and the Have-Nots , Branko Milanovic, one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on wealth, poverty, and the gap that separates them, explains these and other mysteries of how wealth is unevenly spread throughout our world, now and through time. Milanovic uses history, literature and stories straight out of today&#8217;s newspapers, to discuss one of the major divisions in our social lives: between the haves and the have-nots. He reveals just how rich Elizabeth Bennet&#8217;s suitor Mr. Darcy really was how much Anna Karenina gained by falling in love how wealthy ancient Romans compare to today&#8217;s super-rich where in Kenyan income distribution was Obama&#8217;s grandfather how we should think about Marxism in a modern world and how location where one is born determines his wealth. He goes beyond mere entertainment to explain why inequality matters, how it damages our economics prospects, and how it can threaten the foundations of the social order that we take for granted.  Bold, engaging, and illuminating,  The Haves and the Have-Nots  teaches us not only how to think about inequality, but why we should.</p>

<p>                    Unforeseen financial crises. Extreme wealth inequality. Relentless pressure on the environment. Can we go on like this? Is there an alternative?    </p>
<p>                    In Doughnut Economics, Oxford academic Kate Raworth lays out the seven deadly mistakes of economics and offers a radical re-envisioning of the system that has brought us to the point of ruin. Moving beyond the myths of &#8216;rational economic man&#8217; and unlimited growth, Doughnut Economics zeroes in on the sweet spot: a system that meets all our needs without exhausting the planet.    </p>
<p>                    The demands of the 21st century require a new shape of economics. This might just be it.    </p>

<p>                    In business, performance is key. In performance, how you organize can be the key to growth.    </p>
<p>                    In the past five years, the business world has seen the birth of a new breed of company-the Exponential Organization-that has revolutionized how a company can accelerate its growth by using technology. An ExO can eliminate the incremental, linear way traditional companies get bigger, leveraging assets like community, big data, algorithms, and new technology into achieving performance benchmarks ten times better than its peers.    </p>
<p>                    Three luminaries of the business world-Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike Malone-have researched this phenomenon and documented ten characteristics of Exponential Organizations. Here, in EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS, they walk the reader through how any company, from a startup to a multi-national, can become an ExO, streamline its performance, and grow to the next level.    </p>

<p>                    Oxford economist E. F. Schumacher provides an enlightening study of our economic system and its purpose, challenging the current state of excessive consumption in our society. Offering a crucial message for the modern world struggling to balance economic growth with the human costs of globalisation, Small Is Beautiful puts forward the revolutionary yet viable case for building our economies around the needs of communities, not corporations.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A roadmap to what lies ahead and the decisions we must make now to stave off the next global economic and financial crisis, from one of the world&#8217;s most influential economic thinkers and the author of When Markets Collide &#8211; Updated, with a new chapter and author&#8217;s note     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The one economic book you must read now . . . If you want to understand [our] bifurcated world and where it&#8217;s headed, there is no better interpreter than Mohamed El-Erian.&#8221;&#8211;Time     </p>
<p>                    Our current economic path is coming to an end. The signposts are all around us: sluggish growth, rising inequality, stubbornly high pockets of unemployment, and jittery financial markets, to name a few. Soon we will reach a fork in the road: One path leads to renewed growth, prosperity, and financial stability, the other to recession and market disorder.     </p>
<p>                    In The Only Game in Town,  El-Erian casts his gaze toward the future of the global economy and markets, outlining the choices we face both individually and collectively in an era of economic uncertainty and financial insecurity. Beginning with their response to the 2008 global crisis, El-Erian explains how and why our central banks became the critical policy actors&#8211;and, most important, why they cannot continue is this role alone. They saved the financial system from collapse in 2008 and a multiyear economic depression, but lack the tools to enable a return to high inclusive growth and durable financial stability. The time has come for a policy handoff, from a prolonged period of monetary policy experimentation to a strategy that better targets what ails economies and distorts the financial sector&#8211;before we stumble into another crisis.     </p>
<p>                     The future, critically, is not predestined. It is up to us to decide where we will go from here as households, investors, companies, and governments. Using a mix of insights from economics, finance, and behavioral science, this book gives us the tools we need to properly understand this turning point, prepare for it, and come out of it stronger. A comprehensive, controversial look at the realities of our global economy and markets, The Only Game in Town is required reading for investors, policymakers, and anyone interested in the future.</p>

It is designed for any company or leader looking to break out of the ruts of traditional marketing and become more collaborative, less wasteful, and achieve more consistent, replicable, and data-driven results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Case Interview Secrets, you&#8217;ll discover step-by-step instructions on how to dominate what many consider to be the most complex, most difficult, and most intimidating corporate job interview in the world&#8211;the infamous case interview. Victor Cheng, a former McKinsey management consultant, reveals his proven, insider&#8217;s method for acing the case interview. Having personally secured job offers from McKinsey, Bain &#038; Company, Monitor, L.E.K, Oliver Wyman, and A.T. Kearney, he has also been a McKinsey case interviewer&#8211;providing you with a hands-on, real-world perspective on what it really takes to land job offers. Cheng&#8217;s protégées work in all the major strategy management consulting firms, including McKinsey, The Boston Consulting Group, Bain &#038; Company, Monitor Company, A.T. Kearny, Oliver Wyman, L.E.K, Roland Berger, Accenture, and Deloitte, as well as in the strategic planning departments of numerous Fortune 500 companies. Whether you&#8217;re an undergraduate, MBA, PhD, or experienced-hire applicant candidate, you&#8217;ll discover: * What case interviewers really say about you behind closed doors but wouldn&#8217;t dare tell you&#8211;until now * The subtle yet specific performance differences that separate those who get management consulting offers from those who don&#8217;t * The 10 biggest mistakes candidates make in case interviews (and how to avoid them) * The 3 specific things interviewers expect in the first 5 minutes of a case that often decide the outcome on the spot * An insider&#8217;s take on what interviewers really look for and why&#8211;and how to give them what they want Praise for Victor Cheng and Case Interview Secrets &#8220;With Victor&#8217;s help, I went from not knowing anything about consulting to securing offers from McKinsey and BCG.&#8221; &#8211;Mihnea Munteanu, University of Michigan &#8220;I received six offers&#8211;from McKinsey, BCG, Booz, Deloitte, A.T. Kearney, and Marakon. Everything Victor said was right!&#8221; &#8211;Michael Yang, Northwestern University &#8220;Despite having a liberal arts degree from a state school, I landed a dream job with L.E.K. Consulting. Thanks, Victor.&#8221; &#8211;Jackson Boyar, Indiana University &#8220;Victor has put me in a very difficult position&#8211;now I have to decide between offers from two of the top three consultancies!&#8221; &#8211;Christopher Perez, The Wharton School &#8220;In my first attempt to break into consulting, I failed every one of my interviews with McKinsey, Bain, BCG, Oliver Wyman, Monitor, Booz and probably a few others. On my second attempt two years later, I followed everything Victor Cheng suggested and took advantage of every resource he provided &#8230; and received an offer from McKinsey!&#8221; &#8211;Daniel Suo, Business Analyst (Offer Recipient), McKinsey, Stamford &#8220;Without Victor&#8217;s help, I never would have gotten an offer from BCG. What he teaches really makes the difference between getting an offer and not.&#8221; &#8211;Puttipath Tasnavites, Boston Consulting Group, Thailand &#8220;After following Victor&#8217;s guidance, I had a complete breakthrough in my case interview performance and got an offer from Monitor.&#8221; &#8211;Marine Serres, Monitor &#038; Company &#8220;As a PhD candidate in engineering, I had an academic background that left me completely unprepared for the case interview process. That&#8217;s when I found Victor Cheng and ended up getting my dream job. Thank you, Victor!&#8221; &#8211;Zach Jacobson, McKinsey, New York About the Author As a former McKinsey consultant, résumé screener, and case interviewer, Victor Cheng mentors thousands of aspiring consultants via his articles and video tutorials at www.caseinterview.com. As a candidate, he passed 60 cases and received job offers from McKinsey, Bain, Monitor, LEK, AT Kearney, and Oliver Wyman. At McKinsey, he was rated in the top 10 percent of consultants worldwide in his cohort. Today he advises Inc. 500 CEOs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The world is a better place than it used to be. People are healthier, wealthier, and live longer. Yet the escapes from destitution by so many has left gaping inequalities between people and nations. In The Great Escape, Angus Deaton&#8211;one of the foremost experts on economic development and on poverty&#8211;tells the remarkable story of how, beginning 250 years ago, some parts of the world experienced sustained progress, opening up gaps and setting the stage for today&#8217;s disproportionately unequal world. Deaton takes an in-depth look at the historical and ongoing patterns behind the health and wealth of nations, and addresses what needs to be done to help those left behind. Deaton describes vast innovations and wrenching setbacks: the successes of antibiotics, pest control, vaccinations, and clean water on the one hand, and disastrous famines and the HIV/AIDS epidemic on the other. He examines the United States, a nation that has prospered but is today experiencing slower growth and increasing inequality. He also considers how economic growth in India and China has improved the lives of more than a billion people. Deaton argues that international aid has been ineffective and even harmful.<br />
                    He suggests alternative efforts&#8211;including reforming incentives to drug companies and lifting trade restrictions&#8211;that will allow the developing world to bring about its own Great Escape. Demonstrating how changes in health and living standards have transformed our lives, The Great Escape is a powerful guide to addressing the well-being of all nations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>OVER ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD<br />
                    #1 Wall Street Journal Bestseller<br />
                    &#8216;Follow these precepts and you will revolutionize your life.&#8217;  Steven Pressfield, author of The War of Art<br />
                    &#8216;A book for the bedside of every future &#8211; and current &#8211; leader in the world.&#8217; &#8211; Robert Greene, author of The 48 Laws of Power    </p>
<p>                    The Obstacle is the Way has become a cult classic, beloved by men and women around the world who apply its wisdom to become more successful at whatever they do.     </p>
<p>                                    The book&#8217;s many fans include a former governor and movie star (Arnold Schwarzenegger), a hip hop icon (LL Cool J), an Irish tennis pro (James McGee), the World Number 1 golfer (Rory McIlroy) and the coaches and players of winning teams like English Rugby National Team, the New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Cubs.    </p>
<p>                     The book draws its inspiration from stoicism, the ancient Greek philosophy of enduring pain or adversity with perseverance and resilience. Stoics focus on the things they can control, let go of everything else, and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, tougher. As Marcus Aurelius put it nearly 2000 years ago: &#8220;The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     Ryan Holiday shows us how some of the most successful people in history-from John D. Rockefeller to Amelia Earhart to Ulysses S. Grant to Steve Jobs-have applied stoicism to overcome difficult or even impossible situations. Their embrace of these principles ultimately mattered more than their natural intelligence, talents, or luck.    </p>
<p>                     If you&#8217;re feeling frustrated, demoralized, or stuck in a rut, this book can help you turn your problems into your biggest advantages. And along the way it will inspire you with dozens of true stories of the greats from every age and era.</p>
