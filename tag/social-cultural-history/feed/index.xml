										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the religious historian whose The Gnostic Gospels won both the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award comes a dramatic interpretation of Satan and his role on the Christian tradition. With magisterial learning and the elan of a born storyteller, Pagels turns Satan&#8217;s story into an audacious exploration of Christianity&#8217;s shadow side, in which the gospel of love gives way to irrational hatreds that continue to haunt Christians and non-Christians alike.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The groundbreaking international best-seller that turns everything you think about money, debt, and society on its head&#8211;from the &#8220;brilliant, deeply original political thinker&#8221; David Graeber (Rebecca Solnit, author of Men Explain Things to Me) </p>
<p>                    Before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods&#8211;that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors&#8211;which lives on in full force to this day. </p>
<p>                     So says anthropologist David Graeber in a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Renaissance Italy to Imperial China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like &#8220;guilt,&#8221; &#8220;sin,&#8221; and &#8220;redemption&#8221;) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. </p>
<p>                     We are still fighting these battles today.</p>

<p>                    What makes us brilliant? What makes us deadly? What makes us Sapiens?</p>
<p>                    Yuval Noah Harari challenges everything we know about being human.</p>
<p>                    Earth is 4.5 billion years old. In just a fraction of that time, one species among countless others has conquered it: us.</p>
<p>                    In this bold and provocative book, Yuval Noah Harari explores who we are, how we got here and where we&#8217;re going. </p>
<p>                    ________________</p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR SAPIENS:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Jaw-dropping from the first word to the last&#8230; It may be the best book I&#8217;ve ever read&#8217; Chris Evans</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This fascinating history of how, where and why humans swim&#8230;is perfect reading for those missing a splash-about during the lockdown.&#8217; Guardian    </p>
<p>                    From the first recorded dip into what&#8217;s now the driest spot on earth to the recreational swimmers in your local pool, humans have been getting wet for 10,000 years. And for most of modern history, swimming has caused a ripple that touches us all.    </p>
<p>                    Splash! dives into Egypt, winds through ancient Greece and Rome, flows mostly underground through the Dark and Middle Ages (at least in Europe), and then re-emerges in the wake of the Renaissance before taking its final lap at the modern Olympic Games. Along the way, it kicks away the idea that swimming is just about speed or great feats of aquatic endurance, revealing how its history spans religion, fashion, architecture, public health, colonialism, segregation, sexism, sexiness, guts, glory and much, much more.    </p>
<p>                    As refreshing as jumping into a pool on a hot summer&#8217;s day, Splash! sweeps across the whole of humankind&#8217;s swimming history with an irrepressible enthusiasm that will make you crave your next dip.    </p>

<p>                    `What is it&#8217; asks Tom Wolfe, `that makes a man willing to sit on top of an enormous Roman Candle&#8230;and wait for someone to light the fuse?&#8217; Arrogance? Stupidity? Bravery? Courage? Or, simply, that quality we call &#8216;the right stuff&#8217;?    </p>
<p>                    A monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space program, and a dizzying dive into the sweat, fear, beauty and danger of being on the white-hot edge of history in the making.    </p>
<p>                    `Tom Wolfe at his very best&#8230; Learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic&#8230;The Right Stuff is superb&#8217; &#8211; New York Times Book Review    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s a trip &#8211; engrossing, eye-opening, mind altering&#8217; New Statesman</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating. Pollan is the perfect guide &#8230; curious, careful, open minded&#8217; The Guardian</p>
<p>                    From the international bestselling author of How to Change Your Mind comes a ground-breaking exploration of our relationship with natural drugs</p>
<p>                    Of all the many things humans rely on plants for, surely the most curious is our use of them to change consciousness: to stimulate, calm, or completely alter the qualities of our mental experience. In This Is Your Mind On Plants, Michael Pollan explores three very different drugs &#8211; opium, caffeine and mescaline &#8211; and throws the fundamental strangeness of our thinking about them into sharp relief. Exploring and participating in the cultures that have grown up around these drugs, while consuming (or in the case of caffeine, trying not to consume) them, Pollan reckons with the powerful human attraction to psychoactive plants, and the equally powerful taboos. </p>
<p>                    In a unique blend of history, science, memoir and reportage, Pollan shines a fresh light on a subject that is all too often treated reductively. In doing so, he proves that there is much more to say about these plants than simply debating their regulation, for when we take them into our bodies and let them change our minds, we are engaging with nature in one of the most profound ways we can. This ground-breaking and singular book holds up a mirror to our fundamental human needs and aspirations, the operations of our minds and our entanglement with the natural world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AN EMPHATICALLY FEMINIST HISTORY OF DATING    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A new approach to romance&#8230; The heroines of Regency novels could teach today&#8217;s young women a trick or two&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    What if Mr Darcy had simply been able to swipe right?    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This book was a real education for me. It&#8217;s like a Lonely Planet guidebook to dating.&#8217;<br />
                    Gilo    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Lessons to learn for committed singletons and happily married alike, and everyone in between.&#8217;<br />
                    Anon    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved it.&#8217;<br />
                    Adele Taylor    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I found it hard to put down.&#8217;<br />
                    richie666    </p>
<p>                    Dating has never been easy. The road to true love has always been rutted with heartbreak, but do we have it any easier today?     </p>
<p>                    How did Victorians &#8216;come out&#8217;? How did love blossom in war-torn Europe? And why did 80s video-dating never take off?    </p>
<p>                    Bursting with little-known facts and tantalizing tales of lovelorn men and besotted women, Nichi Hodgson&#8217;s intriguing history of amorous relationships, from enamoured Georgians to frenziedly swiping millennials (and everyone in between) may leave you grateful that you live &#8211; and love &#8211; today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1979 two events occurred that would shape the next twenty-five years. In America and Britain, an era of weary consensus was displaced by the arrival of a political marriage of fiery idealists: Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher transformed politics with a combination of breezy charm and assertive &#8220;Victorian values.&#8221; In Iran, the fundamentalist cleric Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini set out to restore a regime that had last existed almost 1,300 years ago. Between them they succeeded in bringing the twentieth century to a premature close. By 1989, Francis Fukuyama was declaring that we had now reached the End of History. What colonized the space recently vacated by notions of history, progress and reason? Cults, quackery, gurus, irrational panics, moral confusion and an epidemic of idiocy, the proof of which was to be found in every state, every work-place, and every library. In  Idiot Proof , columnist Francis Wheen brilliantly evokes the key personalities of the post-political era,including Princess Diana and Deepak Chopra, Osama bin Laden and Nancy Reagan&#8217;s astrologer,while lamenting the extraordinary rise in superstition, relativism and emotional hysteria over the past quarter of a century. In turn comic, indignant, outraged and just plain baffled by the idiocy of it all,  Idiot Proof  is a masterful depiction of the daftness of our times and a plea that we might just think a little more and believe a little less.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this illuminating and thoughtful book, Will and Ariel Durant have succeeded in distilling for the reader the accumulated store of knowledge and experience from their five decades of work on the eleven monumental volumes of The Story of Civilization. The result is a survey of human history, full of dazzling insights into the nature of human experience, the evolution of civilization, and the culture of man. With the completion of their life&#8217;s work, they look back and ask what history has to say about the nature, the conduct and the prospects of man, seeking in the great lives, the great ideas, the great events of the past for the meaning of man&#8217;s long journey through war, conquest and creation &#8211; and for the great themes that can help us to understand our own era.</p>

<p>                    In this &#8220;intellectual odyssey, traveler&#8217;s diary, and comic novel all rolled into one&#8221; (Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness), acclaimed travel writer Weiner sets out to examine the connection between our surroundings and our most innovative ideas. A &#8220;superb travel guide: funny, knowledgeable, and self-deprecating&#8221; (The Washington Post), he explores the history of places like Vienna of 1900, Renaissance Florence, ancient Athens, Song Dynasty Hangzhou, and Silicon Valley to show how certain urban settings are conducive to ingenuity. With his trademark insightful humor, this &#8220;big-hearted humanist&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal) walks the same paths as the geniuses who flourished in these settings to see if the spirit of what inspired figures like Socrates, Michelangelo, and Leonardo remains. In these places, Weiner asks, &#8220;What was in the air, and can we bottle it?&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Fun and thought provoking&#8221; (Miami Herald), The Geography of Genius reevaluates the importance of culture in nurturing creativity and &#8220;offers a practical map for how we can all become a bit more inventive&#8221; (Adam Grant, author of Originals).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What does history really consists of? Centuries of people quietly going about their daily business &#8211; sleeping, eating, having sex, endeavouring to get comfortable.<br />
                    And where did all these normal activities take place?<br />
                    At home.    </p>
<p>                    This was the thought that inspired Bill Bryson to start a journey around the rooms of his own house, an 1851 Norfolk rectory, to consider how the ordinary things in life came to be. And what he discovered are surprising connections to anything from the Crystal Palace to the Eiffel Tower, from scurvy to body-snatching,from bedbugs to the Industrial Revolution, and just about everything else that has ever happened, resulting in one of the most entertaining and illuminating books ever written about the history of the way we live.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who would ever think that a book on cod would make a compulsive read? And yet this is precisely what Kurlansky has done&#8217; Express on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    The Cod. Wars have been fought over it, revolutions have been triggered by it, national diets have been based on it, economies and livelihoods have depended on it. To the millions it has sustained, it has been a treasure more precious that gold. This book spans 1,000 years and four continents. From the Vikings to Clarence Birdseye, Mark Kurlansky introduces the explorers, merchants, writers, chefs and fisherman, whose lives have been interwoven with this prolific fish. He chronicles the cod wars of the 16th and 20th centuries. He blends in recipes and lore from the Middle Ages to the present. In a story that brings world history and human passions into captivating focus, he shows how the most profitable fish in history is today faced with extinction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE TOP 10 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER<br />
                    A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF THE YEAR<br />
                    ONE OF BARACK OBAMA&#8217;S TOP BOOKS OF THE YEAR    </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for The Orwell Prize 2020    </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for the FT Business Book of the Year Award 2019    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Easily the most  important book to be published this  century. I find it hard to take any  young activist seriously who hasn&#8217;t  at least familarised themselves  with Zuboff&#8217;s central ideas.&#8217; &#8211; Zadie Smith, The Guardian    </p>
<p>                    The challenges to humanity posed by the digital future, the first detailed examination of the unprecedented form of power called &#8220;surveillance capitalism,&#8221; and the quest by powerful corporations to predict and control us.    </p>
<p>                    The heady optimism of the Internet&#8217;s early days is gone. Technologies that were meant to liberate us have deepened inequality and stoked divisions. Tech companies gather our information online and sell it to the highest bidder, whether government or retailer. Profits now depend not only on predicting our behaviour but modifying it too. How will this fusion of capitalism and the digital shape our values and define our future?    </p>
<p>                    Shoshana Zuboff shows that we are at a crossroads. We still have the power to decide what kind of world we want to live in, and what we decide now will shape the rest of the century. Our choices: allow technology to enrich the few and impoverish the many, or harness it and distribute its benefits.    </p>
<p>                     The Age of Surveillance Capitalism is a deeply-reasoned examination of the threat of unprecedented power free from democratic oversight. As it explores this new capitalism&#8217;s impact on society, politics, business, and technology, it exposes the struggles that will decide both the next chapter of capitalism and the meaning of information civilization. Most critically, it shows how we can protect ourselves and our communities and ensure we are the masters of the digital rather than its slaves.</p>

<p>                    In this comprehensive and balanced biography we see Luther as a rebel, but not as a lone hero; as a soldier in a mighty struggle for the universal reform of Christianity and its role in the world. The foundation of Protestantism changed the religious landscape of Europe, and subsequently the world, but the author chooses to show not simply as a reformer, but as an individual.    </p>
<p>                    In his study of the Wittenberg monk, Heinz Schilling &#8211; one of Germany&#8217;s leading social and political historians &#8211; gives the reader a rounded view of a difficult, contradictory character, who changed the world by virtue of his immense will.</p>

<p>                                NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE<br />
                    Oscar Nominated For Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay    </p>
<p>                                Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA&#8217;s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America&#8217;s space program.    </p>
<p>                              Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as &#8216;Human Computers&#8217;, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these &#8216;colored computers&#8217; used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets, and astronauts, into space.    </p>
<p>                              Moving from World War II through NASA&#8217;s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War, and the women&#8217;s rights movement, Hidden Figures interweaves a rich history of mankind&#8217;s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As entertaining as it is incisive, Stoned is a raucous journey through the history of human desire for what is rare, and therefore precious.  What makes a stone a jewel? What makes a jewel priceless? And why do we covet beautiful things? In this brilliant account of how eight jewels shaped the course of history, jeweler and scientist Aja Raden tells an original and often startling story about our unshakeable addiction to beauty and the darker side of human desire.  What moves the world is what moves each of us: desire. Jewelry-which has long served as a stand-in for wealth and power, glamor and success-has birthed cultural movements, launched political dynasties, and started wars. Masterfully weaving together pop science and history, Stoned breaks history into three categories-Want, Take, and Have-and explains what the diamond on your finger has to do with the GI Bill, why green-tinted jewelry has been exalted by so many cultures, why the glass beads that bought Manhattan for the Dutch were initially considered a fair trade, and how the French Revolution started over a coveted necklace.<br />
                    Studded with lively personalities and fascinating details, Stoned tells the remarkable story of our abiding desire for the rare and extraordinary.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one dominant myth about the world, one huge mistake we all make &#8230; it is that we all go around assuming the world is much more of a planned place than it is.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                              From the industrial revolution and the rise of China, to urbanisation and the birth of bitcoin, Matt Ridley demolishes conventional assumptions that the great events and trends of our day are dictated by those on high. On the contrary, our most important achievements develop from the ground up. In this wide-ranging and erudite book, Matt Ridley brilliantly makes the case for evolution as the force that has shaped much of our culture, our minds, and that even now is shaping our future.    </p>
<p>                              As compelling as it is controversial, as authoritative as it is ambitious, Ridley&#8217;s deeply thought-provoking book will change the way we think about the world and how it works.</p>

She danced herself to her death six days later, and soon thirty-four more villagers joined her. Then more. In a month more than 400 people had died from the mysterious dancing plague. In late-nineteenth-century England an eccentric gentleman founded the No Nose Club in his gracious townhome&#8211;a social club for those who had lost their noses, and other body parts, to the plague of syphilis for which there was then no cure. And in turn-of-the-century New York, an Irish cook caused two lethal outbreaks of typhoid fever, a case that transformed her into the notorious Typhoid Mary and led to historic medical breakthroughs. Throughout time, humans have been terrified and fascinated by the plagues they&#8217;ve suffered from. Get Well Soon delivers the gruesome, morbid details of some of the worst plagues in human history, as well as stories of the heroic figures who fought to ease their suffering. With her signature mix of in-depth research and upbeat storytelling, and not a little dark humour, Jennifer Wright explores history&#8217;s most gripping and deadly outbreaks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The promise of America is that, with ambition and hard work, anyone can rise to the top. But now the promise has been broken, and weve become an aristocracy where rich parents raise rich kids and poor parents raise poor kids.     </p>
<p>                    Weve been told that the changes are structural, that theres nothing we can do about this. But that doesnt explain why other First World countries are beating us hands down on the issue of mobility.     </p>
<p>                    What&#8217;s different about America is our politics. An ostensibly progressive New Class of comfortably rich professionals, media leaders, and academics has shaped the contours of American politics and given us a country of fixed economic classes. It is supported by the poorest of Americans, who have little chance to rise, an alliance of both ends against the middle that recalls the Red Tories of parliamentary countries. Because they support an aristocracy, the members of the New Class are Tories, and because of their feigned concern for the poor, they are Red Tories.    </p>
<p>                    The Way Back explains the revolution in American politics, where political insurgents have challenged the complacent establishment of both parties, and shows how we can restore the promise of economic mobility and equality by pursuing socialist ends through capitalist means.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FINALIST FOR THE 2019 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD     </p>
<p>                    LONGLISTED FOR THE 2020 ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE     </p>
<p>                    A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Named a best book of 2019 by The New York Times, TIME, The Washington Post,  NPR, Hudson Booksellers, The New York Public Library, The Dallas Morning News, and Library Journal.     </p>
<p>                    Chapter after chapter, it&#8217;s like one shattered myth after another. &#8211; NPR     </p>
<p>                    An informed, moving and kaleidoscopic portrait&#8230; Treuer&#8217;s powerful book suggests the need for soul-searching about the meanings of American history and the stories we tell ourselves about this nation&#8217;s past.. &#8211; New York Times Book Review, front page     </p>
<p>                    A sweeping history&#8211;and counter-narrative&#8211;of Native American life from the Wounded Knee massacre to the present.     </p>
<p>                    The received idea of Native American history&#8211;as promulgated by books like Dee Brown&#8217;s mega-bestselling 1970 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&#8211;has been that American Indian history essentially ended with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. Not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U. S. Cavalry, the sense was, but Native civilization did as well.     </p>
<p>                    Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer has uncovered a different narrative. Because they did not disappear&#8211;and not despite but rather because of their intense struggles to preserve their language, their traditions, their families, and their very existence&#8211;the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented resourcefulness and reinvention.     </p>
<p>                    In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes&#8217; distinctive cultures from first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put the lie to the myth that Indians don&#8217;t know or care about property. The forced assimilation of their children at government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential, intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite 21st-century fears of an &#8216;epidemic&#8217; of loneliness, its history has been sorely neglected. A Biography of Loneliness offers a radically new interpretation of loneliness as an emotional language and experience. Using letters and diaries, philosophical tracts, political discussions, and medical literature from the eighteenth century to the present, historian of the emotions Fay Bound Alberti argues that loneliness is not an ahistorical, universal<br />
                    phenomenon. It is, in fact, a modern emotion: before 1800, its language did not exist. And where loneliness is identified, it is not always bad, but a complex emotional state that differs according to class, gender, ethnicity and experience.    </p>
<p>                    Looking at informative case studies such as Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria, and Virginia Woolf, A Biography of Loneliness charts the emergence of loneliness as a modern and embodied emotional state.</p>

<p>                    How did we get from Scrooge&#8217;s office to &#8220;Office Space&#8221;? From bookkeepers in dark countinghouses to freelancers in bright cafes? What would the world be like without the vertical file cabinet? What would the world be like without the office at all? In Cubed, Nikil Saval chronicles the evolution of the office in a fascinating, often funny, and sometimes disturbing anatomy of the white-collar world and how it came to be the way it is. Drawing on the history of architecture and business, as well as a host of pop culture artifacts&#8211;from Mad Men to Dilbert (and, yes, The Office)&#8211;and ranging in time from the earliest clerical houses to the surprisingly utopian origins of the cubicle to the funhouse campuses of Silicon Valley, Cubed is an all-encompassing investigation into the way we work, why we do it the way we do (and often don&#8217;t like it), and how we might do better.</p>

<p>                              We are not born knowing what to eat; we each have to figure it out for ourselves. From childhood onwards, we learn how big a portion is and how sweet is too sweet. The way we learn to eat holds the key to why food has gone so disastrously wrong for so many people. But how does this happen? And can we ever change our food habits for the better?    </p>
<p>                              An exploration of the extraordinary and surprising origins of our taste and eating habits, in First Bite award-winning food writer Bee Wilson explains how we can change our palates to lead healthier, happier lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times Notable Book of 2016<br />
                    Winner of the Zócalo Public Square Book Prize     </p>
<p>                    On March 29, 1516, the city council of Venice issued a decree forcing Jews to live in il geto&#8211;a closed quarter named for the copper foundry that once occupied the area. The term stuck.     </p>
<p>                    In this sweeping and original account, Mitchell Duneier traces the idea of the ghetto from its beginnings in the sixteenth century and its revival by the Nazis to the present. As Duneier shows, we cannot comprehend the entanglements of race, poverty, and place in America today without recalling the ghettos of Europe, as well as earlier efforts to understand the problems of the American city.     </p>
<p>                    Ghetto is the story of the scholars and activists who tried to achieve that understanding. As Duneier shows, their efforts to wrestle with race and poverty cannot be divorced from their individual biographies, which often included direct encounters with prejudice and discrimination in the academy and elsewhere. Using new and forgotten sources, Duneier introduces us to Horace Cayton and St. Clair Drake, graduate students whose conception of the South Side of Chicago established a new paradigm for thinking about Northern racism and poverty in the 1940s. We learn how the psychologist Kenneth Clark subsequently linked Harlem&#8217;s slum conditions with the persistence of black powerlessness, and we follow the controversy over Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#8217;s report on the black family. We see how the sociologist William Julius Wilson redefined the debate about urban America as middle-class African Americans increasingly escaped the ghetto and the country retreated from racially specific remedies. And we trace the education reformer Geoffrey Canada&#8217;s efforts to transform the lives of inner-city children with ambitious interventions, even as other reformers sought to help families escape their neighborhoods altogether.     </p>
<p>                    Duneier offers a clear-eyed assessment of the thinkers and doers who have shaped American ideas about urban poverty&#8211;and the ghetto. The result is a valuable new estimation of an age-old concept.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1940s and 50s, when the newly minted Jet Propulsion Laboratory needed quick-thinking mathematicians to calculate velocities and plot trajectories, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women&#8211;known as &#8220;human computers&#8221;&#8211;who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews, Nathalia Holt offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we&#8217;ve been, and the far reaches of space to which we&#8217;re heading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book is a house of wonders&#8217; The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Steven Johnson is the Darwin of technology&#8217; Walter Issacson, author of Steve Jobs    </p>
<p>                    What connects Paleolithic bone flutes to the invention of computer software? Or the Murex sea snail to the death of the great American city? How does the bag of crisps you hold in your hand help tell the story of humanity itself?     </p>
<p>                    In his brilliant new work on the history of innovation, international bestseller Steven Johnson argues that the pursuit of novelty and wonder has always been a powerful driver of world-shaping technological change. He finds that  that throughout history, the cutting edge of innovation lies wherever people are working the hardest to keep themselves and others amused.     </p>
<p>                    Johnson&#8217;s storytelling is just as delightful as the inventions he describes, full of surprising stops along the journey from simple concepts to complex modern systems. He introduces us to the colourful innovators of leisure: the explorers, proprietors, showmen, and artists who changed the trajectory of history with their luxurious wares, exotic meals, taverns, gambling tables, and magic shows.    </p>
<p>                    Johnson compellingly argues that observers of technological and social trends should be looking for clues in novel amusements. You&#8217;ll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society throughout history, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today&#8217;s fossil fuel-driven civilization.    </p>
<p>                    I wait for new Smil books the way some people wait for the next &#8216;Star Wars&#8217; movie. In his latest book, Energy and Civilization: A History, he goes deep and broad to explain how innovations in humans&#8217; ability to turn energy into heat, light, and motion have been a driving force behind our cultural and economic progress over the past 10,000 years.<br />
                    &#8211;Bill Gates, Gates Notes, Best Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Energy is the only universal currency; it is necessary for getting anything done. The conversion of energy on Earth ranges from terra-forming forces of plate tectonics to cumulative erosive effects of raindrops. Life on Earth depends on the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy into plant biomass. Humans have come to rely on many more energy flows&#8211;ranging from fossil fuels to photovoltaic generation of electricity&#8211;for their civilized existence. In this monumental history, Vaclav Smil provides a comprehensive account of how energy has shaped society, from pre-agricultural foraging societies through today&#8217;s fossil fuel-driven civilization.     </p>
<p>                    Humans are the only species that can systematically harness energies outside their bodies, using the power of their intellect and an enormous variety of artifacts&#8211;from the simplest tools to internal combustion engines and nuclear reactors. The epochal transition to fossil fuels affected everything: agriculture, industry, transportation, weapons, communication, economics, urbanization, quality of life, politics, and the environment. Smil describes humanity&#8217;s energy eras in panoramic and interdisciplinary fashion, offering readers a magisterial overview. This book is an extensively updated and expanded version of Smil&#8217;s Energy in World History (1994). Smil has incorporated an enormous amount of new material, reflecting the dramatic developments in energy studies over the last two decades and his own research over that time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WINNER OF THE 800-CEO-READ BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR 2015    </p>
<p>                    In the vein of Susan Cain&#8217;s QUIET and Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s DAVID AND GOLIATH, HOW TO FLY A HORSE is a smart, empowering book that dispels the myths around genius and creativity.    </p>
<p>                    There is a myth about how something new comes to be; that geniuses have dramatic moments of insight where great things and thoughts are born whole. Symphonies are composed complete. Science is accomplished with eureka shrieks. Businesses are built by magic touch.    </p>
<p>                    The myth is wrong. Anyone can create.     </p>
<p>                    Acclaimed technology pioneer Kevin Ashton takes us behind the scenes of creation to reveal the true process of discovery and how &#8216;new&#8217; comes to be. From Archimedes to Apple, from Kandinsky to the Coke can, from the Wright brothers &#8211; who set out to &#8216;fly a horse&#8217; &#8211; to Woody Allen, he exposes the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures and countless ordinary and often uncredited acts that led to our most astounding breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of reproduction, and its variants, never change much, but our ideas about the meaning of sex are in constant flux. Switch a decade, cross a border, or traverse class lines and the harmless pleasures of one group become the gravest crimes in another.     </p>
<p>                    Combining meticulous research and lively storytelling, The Boundaries of Desire traces the fast-moving bloodsport of sex law over the past century, and challenges our most cherished notions about family, power, gender, and identity.     </p>
<p>                    Starting when courts censored birth control information as pornography and let men rape their wives, and continuing through the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; and into the present day (when rape, gay rights, sex trafficking, and sex on the internet saturate the news), Berkowitz shows how the law has remained out of synch with the convulsive changes in sexual morality.     </p>
<p>                    By focusing on the stories of real people, Berkowitz adds a compelling human element to what might otherwise be faceless legal battles. The law is made by people, after all, and nothing sparks intolerance &#8211; on the left and right &#8212; more than sex. Ultimately, Berkowitz shows the emptiness of sanctimonious condemnation, and argues that sexual questions are too subtle and volatile for simple, catch-all solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A classic and impassioned account of the first revolution in the Third World.     </p>
<p>                    This powerful, intensely dramatic book is the definitive account of the Haitian Revolution of 1794-1803, a revolution that began in the wake of the Bastille but became the model for the Third World liberation movements from Africa to Cuba. It is the story of the French colony of San Domingo, a place where the brutality of master toward slave was commonplace and ingeniously refined. And it is the story of a barely literate slave named Toussaint L&#8217;Ouverture, who led the black people of San Domingo in a successful struggle against successive invasions by overwhelming French, Spanish, and English forces and in the process helped form the first independent nation in the Caribbean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Figuring explores the complexities of love and the human search for truth and meaning through the interconnected lives of several historical figures across four centuries &#8211; beginning with the astronomer Johannes Kepler, who discovered the laws of planetary motion, and ending with the marine biologist and author Rachel Carson, who catalysed the environmental movement.     </p>
<p>                     Stretching between these figures is a cast of artists, writers, and scientists &#8211; mostly women, mostly queer &#8211; whose public contribution has risen out of their unclassifiable and often heartbreaking private relationships to change the way we understand, experience and appreciate the universe. Among them are the astronomer Maria Mitchell, who paved the way for women in science; the sculptor Harriet Hosmer, who did the same in art; the journalist and literary critic Margaret Fuller, who sparked the feminist movement; and the poet Emily Dickinson.     </p>
<p>                     Emanating from these lives are larger questions about the measure of a good life and what it means to leave a lasting mark of betterment on an imperfect world: Are achievement and acclaim enough for happiness? Is genius? Is love? Weaving through the narrative is a set of peripheral figures &#8211; Ralph Waldo Emerson, Charles Darwin, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Walt Whitman &#8211; and a tapestry of themes spanning music, feminism, the history of science, the rise and decline of religion, and how the intersection of astronomy, poetry and Transcendentalist philosophy fomented the environmental movement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Future is History Masha Gessen follows the lives of four Russians, born as the Soviet Union crumbled, at what promised to be the dawn of democracy. Each came of age with unprecedented expectations, some as the children or grandchildren of the very architects of the new Russia, each with newfound aspirations of their own &#8211; as entrepreneurs, activists, thinkers and writers, sexual and social beings. Gessen charts their paths not only against the machinations of the regime that would seek to crush them all (censorship, intimidation, violence) but also against the war it waged on understanding itself, ensuring the unobstructed emergence of the old Soviet order in the form of today&#8217;s terrifying and seemingly unstoppable mafia state. The Future is History is a powerful and urgent cautionary tale by contemporary Russia&#8217;s most fearless inquisitor.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homer called it a divine substance. Plato described it as especially dear to the gods. As Mark Kurlansky so brilliantly relates here, salt has shaped civilisation from the beginning, and its story is a glittering, often surprising part of the history of mankind. Wars have been fought over salt and, while salt taxes secured empires across Europe and Asia, they have also inspired revolution &#8211; Gandhi&#8217;s salt march in 1930 began the overthrow of British rule in India.     </p>
<p>                    From the rural Sichuan province where the last home-made soya sauce is produced to the Cheshire brine springs that supplied salt around the globe, Mark Kurlansky has produced a kaleidoscope of world history, a multi-layered masterpiece that blends political, commercial, scientific, religious and culinary records into a rich and memorable tale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear.    </p>
<p>                    ONE OF OPRAH&#8217;S &#8220;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8221; &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR &#8211; The Christian Science Monitor &#8211; Southern Living     </p>
<p>                     Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the &#8220;better angels of our nature&#8221; have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&#8217;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear&#8211;a struggle that continues even now.     </p>
<p>                    While the American story has not always&#8211;or even often&#8211;been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, &#8220;The good news is that we have come through such darkness before&#8221;&#8211;as, time and again, Lincoln&#8217;s better angels have found a way to prevail.    </p>
<p>                    Praise for The Soul of America     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.&#8221;&#8211;Walter Isaacson     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Gripping and inspiring, The Soul of America is Jon Meacham&#8217;s declaration of his faith in America.&#8221;&#8211;Newsday    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Meacham gives readers a long-term perspective on American history and a reason to believe the soul of America is ultimately one of kindness and caring, not rancor and paranoia.&#8221;&#8211;USA Today</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emma Watson&#8217;s Our Shared Shelf book club choice<br />
                    New York Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Fascinating.&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                     &#8216;Thrilling.&#8217;       Mail on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    All they wanted was the chance to shine.    </p>
<p>                     Be careful what you wish for&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The first thing we asked was, &#8220;Does this stuff hurt you?&#8221; And they said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The company said that it wasn&#8217;t dangerous, that we didn&#8217;t need to be afraid.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     As the First World War spread across the world, young American women flocked to work in factories, painting clocks, watches and military dials with a special luminous substance made from radium. It was a fun job, lucrative and glamorous &#8211; the girls shone brightly in the dark, covered head to toe in dust from the paint.    </p>
<p>                     However, as the years passed, the women began to suffer from mysterious and crippling illnesses. It turned out that the very thing that had made them feel alive &#8211; their work &#8211; was slowly killing them: the radium paint was poisonous.    </p>
<p>                     Their employers denied all responsibility, but these courageous women &#8211; in the face of unimaginable suffering &#8211; refused to accept their fate quietly, and instead became determined to fight for justice.<br />
                     Drawing on previously unpublished diaries, letters and interviews, The Radium Girls is an intimate narrative of an unforgettable true story. It is the powerful tale of a group of ordinary women from the Roaring Twenties, who themselves learned how to roar.    </p>
<p>                    Further praise for The Radium Girls    </p>

                    *WINNER OF THE PUSHKIN HOUSE BOOK PRIZE 2019*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As moving as it is painstakingly researched. . . a cracking read&#8217; Viv Groskop, Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A riveting account of human error and state duplicity. . . rightly being hailed as a classic&#8217; Hannah Betts, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    On 26 April 1986 at 1.23am a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant in Soviet Ukraine exploded. While the authorities scrambled to  understand what was occurring, workers, engineers, firefighters and  those living in the area were abandoned to their fate. The blast put the  world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, contaminating over half of  Europe with radioactive fallout.    </p>
<p>                    In Chernobyl, award-winning  historian Serhii Plokhy draws on recently opened archives to recreate  these events in all their drama. A moment by moment account of the heroes, perpetrators and victims of a tragedy, Chernobyl is the first full account of a gripping, unforgettable Cold War story.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling history of the 1986 disaster and its aftermath . . .  plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl  control room on that fateful night when human frailty and design flaws  combined to such devastating effect&#8217; Daniel Beer, Guardian    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We need this message more than ever&#8217; Malala Yousafzai    </p>
<p>                    The right to:<br />
                    Spend your own money. Go to school. Earn an income. Access contraceptives. Work outside the home. Walk outside the home. Choose whom to marry. Get a loan. Start a business. Own property. Divorce a husband. See a doctor. Drive a car.<br />
                    All of these rights are denied to women in some parts of the world.    </p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times bestselling debut from Melinda Gates, a timely and necessary call to action for women&#8217;s empowerment.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;How can we summon a moment of lift for human beings &#8211; and especially for women? Because when you lift up women, you lift up humanity.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    In this moving and compelling book, Melinda shares the stories of the inspiring people she&#8217;s met during her work and travels around the world and the lessons she&#8217;s learned from them. As she writes in the introduction, &#8220;That is why I had to write this book &#8211; to share the stories of people who have given focus and urgency to my life. I want all of us to see ways we can lift women up where we live.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    Melinda&#8217;s unforgettable narrative is backed by startling data as she presents the issues that most need our attention &#8211; from child marriage to lack of access to contraceptives to gender inequity in the workplace. And, for the first time, she writes about her personal life and the road to equality in her own marriage. Throughout, she shows how there has never been more opportunity to change the world &#8211; and ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    When we lift others up, they lift us up, too.</p>

<p>                    ***BEST BOOKS OF 2018 SELECTION BY***<br />
                     * WASHINGTON POST  * People * NPR * ESQUIRE * ELLE * WIRED * REFINERY 29 *    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;In a year when issues of gender and sexuality dominated the national conversation, no one shaped that exchange more than Rebecca Traister. Her wise and provocative columns helped make sense of a cultural transformation.&#8221;-National Magazine Award Citation, 2018    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The most brilliant voice on feminism in this country.&#8221;-Anne Lamott, author of Bird by Bird    </p>
<p>                    From Rebecca Traister, the New York Times bestselling author of All the Single Ladies comes a vital, incisive exploration into the transformative power of female anger and its ability to transcend into a political movement.     </p>
<p>                    In the year 2018, it seems as if women&#8217;s anger has suddenly erupted into the public conversation. But long before Pantsuit Nation, before the Women&#8217;s March, and before the #MeToo movement, women&#8217;s anger was not only politically catalytic-but politically problematic. The story of female fury and its cultural significance demonstrates the long history of bitter resentment that has enshrouded women&#8217;s slow rise to political power in America, as well as the ways that anger is received when it comes from women as opposed to when it comes from men.    </p>
<p>                     With eloquence and fervor, Rebecca tracks the history of female anger as political fuel-from suffragettes marching on the White House to office workers vacating their buildings after Clarence Thomas was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Here Traister explores women&#8217;s anger at both men and other women; anger between ideological allies and foes; the varied ways anger is perceived based on its owner; as well as the history of caricaturing and delegitimizing female anger; and the way women&#8217;s collective fury has become transformative political fuel-as is most certainly occurring today. She deconstructs society&#8217;s (and the media&#8217;s) condemnation of female emotion (notably, rage) and the impact of their resulting repercussions.    </p>
<p>                     Highlighting a double standard perpetuated against women by all sexes, and its disastrous, stultifying effect, Traister&#8217;s latest is timely and crucial. It offers a glimpse into the galvanizing force of women&#8217;s collective anger, which, when harnessed, can change history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This rich and magisterial work traces Palestine&#8217;s millennia-old heritage, uncovering cultures and societies of astounding depth and complexity that stretch back to the very beginnings of recorded history.    </p>
<p>                    Starting with the earliest references in Egyptian and Assyrian texts, Nur Masalha explores how Palestine and its Palestinian identity have evolved over thousands of years, from the Bronze Age to the present day. Drawing on a rich body of sources and the latest archaeological evidence, Masalha shows how Palestine&#8217;s multicultural past has been distorted and mythologised by Biblical lore and the Israel-Palestinian conflict.    </p>
<p>                    In the process, Masalha reveals that the concept of Palestine, contrary to accepted belief, is not a modern invention or one constructed in opposition to Israel, but rooted firmly in ancient past. Palestine represents the authoritative account of the country&#8217;s history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now the subject of a film by Richard Linklater, Eric Schlosser&#8217;s explosive bestseller Fast Food Nation: What the All-American Meal is Doing to the World tells the story of our love affair with fast food.    </p>
<p>                      Britain eats more fast food than any other country in Europe. It looks good, tastes good, and it&#8217;s cheap. But the real cost never appears on the menu.    </p>
<p>                      Eric Schlosser visits the lab that re-creates the smell of strawberries; examines the safety records of abattoirs; reveals why the fries really taste so good and what lurks between the sesame buns &#8211; and shows how fast food is transforming not only our diets but our world.    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Fast Food Nation has lifted the polystyrene lid on the global fast food industry &#8230; and sparked a storm&#8217;<br />
                      Observer    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Has wiped that smirk off the Happy Meal &#8230; Thanks to this man, you&#8217;ll never eat a burger again&#8217;<br />

<p>                      &#8216;Startling &#8230; Junk food, we learn, is just that &#8230; left this reader vowing never to set foot in one of those outlets again&#8217;<br />
                      Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;This book tells you more than you really want to know when you&#8217;re chomping on that hamburger &#8230; Have a nice day? Listen &#8211; you should live so long&#8217;<br />
                      The Times    </p>
<p>                      Eric Schlosser is a correspondent for the Atlantic Monthly. His first book, Fast Food Nation, was a major international bestseller. His work has appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, Rolling Stone and the Guardian. He has received a number of journalistic honours, including a National Magazine Award for an Atlantic Review article on the drug trade, which was later adapted into the book Reefer Madness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his rich and nuanced portrait of the remarkable, elusive Rothschild  family, Oxford scholar and bestselling author Niall Ferguson uncovers  the secrets behind the family&#8217;s phenomenal economic success. He reveals  for the first time the details of the family&#8217;s vast political network,  which gave it access to and influence over many of the greatest  statesmen of the age. And he tells a family saga, tracing the importance  of unity and the profound role of Judaism in the lives of a dynasty  that rose from the confines of the Frankfurt ghetto and later used its  influence to assist oppressed Jews throughout Europe. A definitive work  of impeccable scholarship with a thoroughly engaging narrative, &#8216;The  House of Rothschild&#8217; is a biography of the rarest kind, in which  mysterious and fascinating historical figures finally spring to life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>** A RADIO 4 BOOK OF THE WEEK **    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating . . . The history of the world through the eye of a needle . . . I recommend this book to anyone&#8217; THE SPECTATOR<br />
                    &#8216;A charming, absorbing and history that takes us on a journey from the silk roads to sportswear, from ruffs to spacesuits . . . I devoured this quietly feminist book&#8217; SUNDAY TIMES<br />
                    &#8216;Joyful and beautiful&#8217; NATURE<br />
                    &#8216;Will make you rethink your relationship with fabric&#8217; ELLE DECORATION    </p>
<p>                    All textiles begin with a twist. From colourful 30,000-year old threads found on the floor of a Georgian cave to what the linen wrappings of Tutankhamun&#8217;s mummy actually meant; from the Silk Roads to the woollen sails that helped the Vikings reach America 700 years before Columbus; from the lace ruffs that infuriated the puritans to the Indian calicoes and chintzes that powered the Industrial Revolution, our continuing reinvention of cloth tells fascinating stories of human ingenuity.     </p>
<p>                    When we talk of lives hanging by a thread, being interwoven, or part of the social fabric, we are part of a tradition that stretches back many thousands of years. Fabric has allowed us to achieve extraordinary things and survive in unlikely places, and this book shows you how &#8212; and why.    </p>
<p>                    With a cast that includes Chinese empresses, Richard the Lionheart and Bing Crosby, Kassia St Clair takes us on the run with escaped slaves, climbing the slopes of Everest and moonwalking with astronauts. Running like a bright line through history, The Golden Thread offers an unforgettable adventure through our past, present and future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestseller and &#8220;a passionate, urgent&#8221; (The New Yorker) examination of the growing inequality gap from the bestselling author of Bowling Alone: why fewer Americans today have the opportunity for upward mobility.<br />
                         Central to the very idea of America is the principle that we are a nation of opportunity. But over the last quarter century we have seen a disturbing &#8220;opportunity gap&#8221; emerge. We Americans have always believed that those who have talent and try hard will succeed, but this central tenet of the American Dream seems no longer true or at the least, much less true than it was.<br />
                         In Our Kids, Robert Putnam offers a personal and authoritative look at this new American crisis, beginning with the example of his high school class of 1959 in Port Clinton, Ohio. The vast majority of those students went on to lives better than those of their parents. But their children and grandchildren have faced diminishing prospects. Putnam tells the tale of lessening opportunity through poignant life stories of rich, middle class, and poor kids from cities and suburbs across the country, brilliantly blended with the latest social-science research.<br />
                         &#8220;A truly masterful volume&#8221; (Financial Times), Our Kids provides a disturbing account of the American dream that is &#8220;thoughtful and persuasive&#8221; (The Economist). Our Kids offers a rare combination of individual testimony and rigorous evidence: &#8220;No one can finish this book and feel complacent about equal opportunity&#8221;</p>

Sometimes it is hauntingly specific: flames searing patterns on the ceiling, a hydrogen bomb, a terrorist. More often, anxiety overwhelms us from some source within: there is an irrational panic about venturing outside, a dread of failure, a premonition of doom.<br />
                    In this astonishing book we encounter the fears and anxieties of hundreds of British and American men, women and children. From fear of the crowd to agoraphobia, from battle experiences to fear of nuclear attack, from cancer to AIDS, this is an utterly original insight into the mindset of the twentieth century from one of most brilliant historians and thinkers of our time.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;An extraordinarily good book.&#8221; -Edward O. Wilson    </p>
<p>                    The lively and definitive story of the beauty, sexuality, lore, economics, and ecology of the world &#8216;s flowers, written by a devoted scientist and illustrated with his stunning photographs.    </p>
<p>                    Flowers-and the fruits they often become-feed, clothe, and inspire us. Indeed, they have done so for all of human history. Yet although we use flowers to celebrate important occasions, to express love, and to please our senses, we know little about them, their functions in nature, or even how we depend on them.    </p>
<p>                    In a volume that will delight gardeners, naturalists, cooks, artists, or anyone interested in history or culture, pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann serves as an expert guide through the fascinating world of flowers. He explains how other species relate to flowers in ways crucial to the natural world. Next he takes us on an engaging exploration of the roles flowers play in the production of food, spices, medicines, and perfumes. Flowering plants, Buchmann then shows, have long served as inspirational themes in art and literature. Flowers have in fact so thoroughly seduced us that we now buy some ten million a day, driving breeders to create infinite varieties and unusual blooms. In this cultural and natural investigation of floral history, Stephen Buchmann&#8217;s masterful narrative illuminates just why there is, indeed, a reason for flowers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Danes are the happiest people in the world, and pay the highest taxes.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Neutral&#8217; Sweden is one of the biggest arms manufacturers in the world.    </p>
<p>                    Finns have the largest per capita gun ownership after the US and Yemen.    </p>
<p>                    54 per cent of Icelanders believe in elves.    </p>
<p>                    Norway is the richest country on earth.    </p>
<p>                    5 per cent of Danish men have had sex with an animal.    </p>
<p>                    Michael Booth has lived among the Scandinavians, on and off, for over ten years, perplexed by their many strange paradoxes and character traits and equally bemused by the unquestioning enthusiasm for all things Nordic and hygge that has engulfed the rest of the world.     </p>
<p>                    He leaves his adopted home of Denmark and embarks on a journey through all five of the Nordic countries to discover who these curious tribes are, the secrets of their success and, most intriguing of all, what they think of each other. Along the way a more nuanced, often darker picture emerges of a region plagued by taboos, characterised by suffocating parochialism and populated by extremists of various shades.    </p>

<p>                    &#8220;There Kevin Young goes again, giving us books we greatly need, cleverly disguised as books we merely want. Unexpectedly essential.&#8221;&#8211;Marlon James     </p>
<p>                    Award-winning poet and critic Kevin Young tours us through a rogue&#8217;s gallery of hoaxers, plagiarists, forgers, and fakers&#8211;from the humbug of P. T. Barnum and Edgar Allan Poe to the unrepentant bunk of JT LeRoy and Donald J. Trump. Bunk traces the history of the hoax as a peculiarly American phenomenon, examining what motivates hucksters and makes the rest of us so gullible. Disturbingly, Young finds that fakery is woven from stereotype and suspicion, race being the most insidious American hoax of all. He chronicles how Barnum came to fame by displaying figures like Joice Heth, a black woman whom he pretended was the 161-year-old nursemaid to George Washington, and What Is It?, an African American man Barnum professed was a newly discovered missing link in evolution.    </p>
<p>                    Bunk then turns to the hoaxing of history and the ways that forgers, plagiarists, and journalistic fakers invent backstories and falsehoods to sell us lies about themselves and about the world in our own time, from pretend Native Americans Grey Owl and Nasdijj to the deadly imposture of Clark Rockefeller, from the made-up memoirs of James Frey to the identity theft of Rachel Dolezal. In this brilliant and timely work, Young asks what it means to live in a post-factual world of &#8220;truthiness&#8221; where everything is up for interpretation and everyone is subject to a pervasive cynicism that damages our ideas of reality, fact, and art.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For readers of Hillbilly Elegy and Strangers in Their Own Land     </p>
<p>                    *A New York Post Must-Read Book*<br />
                    *A Newsweek Best New Book*<br />
                    *One of The Week&#8217;s 20 Books to Read in 2017*<br />

                    *Best Non-Fiction/2017 Books by the Banks*     </p>
<p>                    The Wall Street Journal: A devastating portrait&#8230;For anyone wondering why swing-state America voted against the establishment in 2016, Mr. Alexander supplies plenty of answers.      </p>
<p>                    Laura Miller, Slate: This book hunts bigger game. Reads like an odd&#8211;and oddly satisfying&#8211;fusion of George Packer&#8217;s The Unwinding and one of Michael Lewis&#8217; real-life financial thrillers.     </p>
<p>                    The New Yorker: Does a remarkable job.     </p>
<p>                    Beth Macy, author of Factory Man: This book should be required reading for people trying to understand Trumpism, inequality, and the sad state of a needlessly wrecked rural America. I wish I had written it.      </p>
<p>                    In 1947, Forbes magazine declared Lancaster, Ohio the epitome of the all-American town. Today it is damaged, discouraged, and fighting for its future. In Glass House, journalist Brian Alexander uses the story of one town to show how seeds sown 35 years ago have sprouted to give us Trumpism, inequality, and an eroding national cohesion.     </p>
<p>                    The Anchor Hocking Glass Company, once the world&#8217;s largest maker of glass tableware, was the base on which Lancaster&#8217;s society was built. As Glass House unfolds, bankruptcy looms. With access to the company and its leaders, and Lancaster&#8217;s citizens, Alexander shows how financial engineering took hold in the 1980s, accelerated in the 21st Century, and wrecked the company. We follow CEO Sam Solomon, an African-American leading the nearly all-white town&#8217;s biggest private employer, as he tries to rescue the company from the New York private equity firm that hired him. Meanwhile, Alexander goes behind the scenes, entwined with the lives of residents as they wrestle with heroin, politics, high-interest lenders, low wage jobs, technology, and the new demands of American life: people like Brian Gossett, the fourth generation to work at Anchor Hocking; Joe Piccolo, first-time director of the annual music festival who discovers the town relies on him, and it, for salvation; Jason Roach, who police believed may have been Lancaster&#8217;s biggest drug dealer; and Eric Brown, a local football hero-turned-cop who comes to realize that he can never arrest Lancaster&#8217;s real problems.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A celebration of American history through the music that helped to shape a nation, by Pulitzer Prize winner Jon Meacham and music superstar Tim McGraw &#8220;Jon Meacham and Tim McGraw form an irresistible duo&#8211;connecting us to music as an unsung force in our nation&#8217;s history.&#8221;&#8211;Doris Kearns Goodwin  Through all the years of strife and triumph, America has been shaped not just by our elected leaders and our formal politics but also by our music&#8211;by the lyrics, performers, and instrumentals that have helped to carry us through the dark days and to celebrate the bright ones. From &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; to &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.,&#8221; Jon Meacham and Tim McGraw take readers on a moving and insightful journey through eras in American history and the songs and performers that inspired us. Meacham chronicles our history, exploring the stories behind the songs, and Tim McGraw reflects on them as an artist and performer. Their perspectives combine to create a unique view of the role music has played in uniting and shaping a nation.  Beginning with the battle hymns of the revolution, and taking us through songs from the defining events of the Civil War, the fight for women&#8217;s suffrage, the two world wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and into the twenty-first century, Meacham and McGraw explore the songs that defined generations, and the cultural and political climates that produced them. Readers will discover the power of music in the lives of figures such as Harriet Tubman, Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and will learn more about some of our most beloved musicians and performers, including Marian Anderson, Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Duke Ellington, Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, and more. Songs of America explores both famous songs and lesser-known ones, expanding our understanding of the scope of American music and lending deeper meaning to the historical context of such songs as &#8220;My Country, &#8216;Tis of Thee,&#8221; &#8220;God Bless America,&#8221; &#8220;Over There,&#8221; &#8220;We Shall Overcome,&#8221; and &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind.&#8221; As Quincy Jones says, Meacham and McGraw have &#8220;convened a concert in Songs of America,&#8221; one that reminds us of who we are, where we&#8217;ve been, and what we, at our best, can be.</p>

<p>                    In The Tyranny of E-mail, John Freeman takes an entertaining look at the unrelenting nature of correspondence through the ages. Put down your smart phone and consider the consequences. As the toll of e-mail mounts, reducing our time for leisure and contemplation and separating us in an unending and lonely battle with the overfull inbox, John Freeman&#8211;one of America&#8217;s preeminent literary critics&#8211;enters a plea for communication that is more selective and nuanced and, above all, more sociable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Almost everyone swears, or worries about not swearing, from the two year-old who has just discovered the power of potty mouth to the grandma who wonders why every other word she hears is obscene. Whether they express anger or exhilaration, are meant to insult or to commend, swear words perform a crucial role in language. But swearing is also a uniquely well-suited lens through which to look at history, offering a fascinating record of what people care about on the<br />
                    deepest levels of a culture-what&#8217;s divine, what&#8217;s terrifying, and what&#8217;s taboo.     </p>
<p>                    Holy Sh*t tells the story of two kinds of swearing-obscenities and oaths-from ancient Rome and the Bible to today. With humor and insight, Melissa Mohr takes readers on a journey to discover how &#8220;swearing&#8221; has come to include both testifying with your hand on the Bible and calling someone a *#$&#038;!* when they cut you off on the highway. She explores obscenities in ancient Rome-which were remarkably similar to our own-and unearths the history of religious oaths in the Middle Ages,<br />
                    when swearing (or not swearing) an oath was often a matter of life and death. Holy Sh*t also explains the advancement of civility and corresponding censorship of language in the 18th century, considers the rise of racial slurs after World War II, examines the physiological effects of swearing (increased heart<br />
                    rate and greater pain tolerance), and answers a question that preoccupies the FCC, the US Senate, and anyone who has recently overheard little kids at a playground: are we swearing more now than people did in the past?     </p>
<p>                    A gem of lexicography and cultural history, Holy Sh*t is a serious exploration of obscenity-and it also just might expand your repertoire of words to choose from the next time you shut your finger in the car door.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Happiness has meant different things in different times: according to Aristotle, only the gods could be truly happy, but if you lived ethically, you might come close; for medieval Christians, the best way to be happy was to suffer pain and for Romantic philosophers like Rousseau, society made happiness impossible. But what does it mean to be happy today? In this devastatingly witty new book, Carl Cederstrom traces our present-day fantasy of happiness from its roots in the 60&#8217;s counter-culture. He argues that happiness is now defined by a desire to be &#8216;authentic&#8217;, to experience physical pleasure, and to cultivate one&#8217;s &#8216;brand&#8217; as an employee. Along the way we encounter the renegade Austrian psychoanalysts, Big Pharma, Californian bohemians, self-help gurus and Silicon Valley CEOs who have all contributed to our current fantasy. Whilst these ideals may have depicted the good life in the 70s, a time of affluence and abundance, they are no longer sustainable in our current age of austerity. It is high time, Cederstrom argues, that we construct new fantasies of happiness.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;This estimable book rides into the summer doldrums like rural electrification. . . . It deals in the truths that matter.&#8221;-Dwight Garner, The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;This eye-opening investigation into our country&#8217;s entrenched social hierarchy is acutely relevant.&#8221;-O, The Oprah Magazine    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;White Trash will change the way we think about our past and present.&#8221;<br />
                     -T. J. Stiles, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Custer&#8217;s Trials     </p>
<p>                     In her groundbreaking  bestselling history of the class system in America, Nancy Isenberg, co-author of The Problem of Democracy, takes on our comforting myths about equality, uncovering the crucial legacy of the ever-present, always embarrassing-if occasionally entertaining-poor white trash.    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;When you turn an election into a three-ring circus, there&#8217;s always a chance that the dancing bear will win,&#8221; says Isenberg of the political climate surrounding Sarah Palin. And we recognize how right she is today. Yet the voters that put Trump in the White House have been a permanent part of our American fabric, argues Isenberg.    </p>
<p>                     The wretched and landless poor have existed from the time of the earliest British colonial settlement to today&#8217;s hillbillies. They were alternately known as &#8220;waste people,&#8221; &#8220;offals,&#8221; &#8220;rubbish,&#8221; &#8220;lazy lubbers,&#8221; and &#8220;crackers.&#8221; By the 1850s, the downtrodden included so-called &#8220;clay eaters&#8221; and &#8220;sandhillers,&#8221; known for prematurely aged children distinguished by their yellowish skin, ragged clothing, and listless minds.    </p>
<p>                     Surveying political rhetoric and policy, popular literature and scientific theories over four hundred years, Isenberg upends assumptions about America&#8217;s supposedly class-free society&#8211;where liberty and hard work were meant to ensure real social mobility. Poor whites were central to the rise of the Republican Party in the early nineteenth century, and the Civil War itself was fought over class issues nearly as much as it was fought over slavery. Reconstruction pitted poor white trash against newly freed slaves, which factored in the rise of eugenics&#8211;a widely popular movement embraced by Theodore Roosevelt that targeted poor whites for sterilization. These poor were at the heart of New Deal reforms and LBJ&#8217;s Great Society; they haunt us in reality TV shows like Here Comes Honey Boo Boo and Duck Dynasty. Marginalized as a class, white trash have always been at or near the center of major political debates over the character of the American identity.    </p>
<p>                     We acknowledge racial injustice as an ugly stain on our nation&#8217;s history. With Isenberg&#8217;s landmark book, we will have to face the truth about the enduring, malevolent nature of class as well.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new, updated, revised edition of JERUSALEM: THE BIOGRAPHY, the wider history of the Middle East through the lens of the Holy City, covering from pre-history to 2020, from King David to Donald Trump.     </p>
<p>                    The story of Jerusalem is the story of the world.    </p>
<p>                    Jerusalem is the universal city, the capital of two peoples, the shrine of three faiths; it is the site of Judgement Day and the battlefield of today&#8217;s clash of civilisations. How did this small, remote town become the Holy City, the &#8216;centre of the world&#8217; and now the key to peace in the Middle East? Drawing on new archives and a lifetime&#8217;s study, Montefiore reveals this ever-changing city through the wars, love affairs and revelations of the kings, empresses, prophets, poets, saints, conquerors and whores who created, destroyed, chronicled and believed in Jerusalem.    </p>
<p>                    A classic of modern literature, this is not only the epic story of 3,000 years of faith, slaughter, fanaticism and co-existence, but also a freshly-updated history of the entire Middle East, from King David to the twenty-first century, from the birth of Judaism, Christianity and Islam to the Israel-Palestine conflict and the wars of today. This is how Jerusalem became Jerusalem &#8211; the only city that exists twice &#8211; in heaven and on earth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A symphonic oral history about the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the emergence of a new Russia, from Svetlana Alexievich, winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature    </p>
<p>                    NAMED ONE OF THE TEN BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE WASHINGTON POST AND PUBLISHERS WEEKLY &#8211; LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE WINNER    </p>
<p>                     NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY<br />
                    The New York Times &#8211; The Washington Post &#8211; The Boston Globe &#8211; The Wall Street Journal &#8211; NPR &#8211; Financial Times &#8211; Kirkus Reviews    </p>
<p>                     When the Swedish Academy awarded Svetlana Alexievich the Nobel Prize, it cited her for inventing &#8220;a new kind of literary genre,&#8221; describing her work as &#8220;a history of emotions&#8211;a history of the soul.&#8221; Alexievich&#8217;s distinctive documentary style, combining extended individual monologues with a collage of voices, records the stories of ordinary women and men who are rarely given the opportunity to speak, whose experiences are often lost in the official histories of the nation.     </p>
<p>                     In Secondhand Time,  Alexievich chronicles the demise of communism. Everyday Russian citizens recount the past thirty years, showing us what life was like during the fall of the Soviet Union and what it&#8217;s like to live in the new Russia left in its wake. Through interviews spanning 1991 to 2012, Alexievich takes us behind the propaganda and contrived media accounts, giving us a panoramic portrait of contemporary Russia and Russians who still carry memories of oppression, terror, famine, massacres&#8211;but also of pride in their country, hope for the future, and a belief that everyone was working and fighting together to bring about a utopia. Here is an account of life in the aftermath of an idea so powerful it once dominated a third of the world.     </p>
<p>                     A magnificent tapestry of the sorrows and triumphs of the human spirit woven by a master, Secondhand Time tells the stories that together make up the true history of a nation. &#8220;Through the voices of those who confided in her,&#8221; The Nation writes, &#8220;Alexievich tells us about human nature, about our dreams, our choices, about good and evil&#8211;in a word, about ourselves.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Svetlana Alexievich and Secondhand Time     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The nonfiction volume that has done the most to deepen the emotional understanding of Russia during and after the collapse of the Soviet Union of late is Svetlana Alexievich&#8217;s oral history Secondhand Time.&#8221;&#8211;David Remnick, The New Yorker</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION * BEST BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION BY THE BOSTON GLOBE * ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY * NPR * CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY *    </p>
<p>                     The New York Times bestselling investigation into the sexual, economic, and emotional lives of women is &#8220;an informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just the single ladies-who want to gain a greater understanding of this pivotal moment in the history of the United States&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review).    </p>
<p>                    In 2009, award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman. It was the year the proportion of American women who were married dropped below fifty percent; and the median age of first marriages, which had remained between twenty and twenty-two years old for nearly a century (1890-1980), had risen dramatically to twenty-seven.    </p>
<p>                    But over the course of her vast research and more than a hundred interviews with academics and social scientists and prominent single women, Traister discovered a startling truth: the phenomenon of the single woman in America is not a new one. And historically, when women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, the results were massive social change-temperance, abolition, secondary education, and more. Today, only twenty percent of Americans are married by age twenty-nine, compared to nearly sixty percent in 1960.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just single ladies&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review), All the Single Ladies is a remarkable portrait of contemporary American life and how we got here, through the lens of the unmarried American woman. Covering class, race, sexual orientation, and filled with vivid anecdotes from fascinating contemporary and historical figures, &#8220;we&#8217;re better off reading Rebecca Traister on women, politics, and America than pretty much anyone else&#8221; (The Boston Globe).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Does anyone date anymore?&#8221; Today, the authorities tell us that courtship is in crisis. But when Moira Weigel dives into the history of sex and romance in modern America, she discovers that authorities have always said this. Ever since young men and women started to go out together, older generations have scolded them: That&#8217;s not the way to find true love. The first women who made dates with strangers were often arrested for prostitution; long before &#8220;hookup culture,&#8221; there were &#8220;petting parties&#8221;; before parents worried about cell phone apps, they fretted about joyrides and &#8220;parking.&#8221; Dating is always dying. But this does not mean that love is dead. It simply changes with the economy. Dating is, and always has been, tied to work.     </p>
<p>                    Lines like &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick you up at six&#8221; made sense at a time when people had jobs that started and ended at fixed hours. But in an age of contract work and flextime, many of us have become sexual freelancers, more likely to text a partner &#8220;u still up?&#8221; Weaving together over one hundred years of history with scenes from the contemporary landscape, Labor of Love offers a fresh feminist perspective on how we came to date the ways we do. This isn&#8217;t a guide to &#8220;getting the guy.&#8221; There are no ridiculous &#8220;rules&#8221; to follow. Instead, Weigel helps us understand how looking for love shapes who we are&#8211;and hopefully leads us closer to the happy ending that dating promises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society.     </p>
<p>                     Some Americans insist that we&#8217;re living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America &#8212; it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.     </p>
<p>                     In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis.     </p>
<p>                     As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation&#8217;s racial inequities.     </p>
<p>                     In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, human beings tend to think of happiness as a natural right. But they haven&#8217;t always felt this way. For the ancient Greeks, happiness meant virtue. For the Romans, it implied prosperity and divine favor. For Christians, happiness was synonymous with God. Throughout history, happiness has been equated regularly with the highest human calling, the most perfect human state. Yet it&#8217;s only within the past two hundred years that human beings have begun to think of happiness as not just an earthly possibility but also as an earthly entitlement, even an obligation. In this sweeping new book, historian Darrin M. McMahon argues that our modern belief in happiness is the product of a dramatic revolution in human expectations carried out since the eighteenth century.<br />
                    In the tradition of works by Peter Gay and Simon Schama, Happiness draws on a multitude of sources, including art and architecture, poetry and scripture, music and theology, and literature and myth, to offer a sweeping intellectual history of man&#8217;s most elusive yet coveted goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE CLASSIC NATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    A wonderful, splendid book&#8211;a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future. -Howard Fast    </p>
<p>                    Historian Howard Zinn&#8217;s A People&#8217;s History of the United States chronicles American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official narrative taught in schools&#8211;with its emphasis on great men in high places&#8211;to focus on the street, the home, and the workplace.    </p>
<p>                    Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, it is the only volume to tell America&#8217;s story from the point of view of&#8211;and in the words of&#8211;America&#8217;s women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As Zinn shows, many of our country&#8217;s greatest battles&#8211;the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women&#8217;s rights, racial equality&#8211;were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.     </p>
<p>                    Covering Christopher Columbus&#8217;s arrival through President Clinton&#8217;s first term, A People&#8217;s History of the United States features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history. This edition also includes an introduction by Anthony Arnove, who wrote, directed, and produced The People Speak with Zinn and who coauthored, with Zinn, Voices of a People&#8217;s History of the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are mass violence and catastrophes the only forces that can seriously decrease economic inequality? To judge by thousands of years of history, the answer is yes. Tracing the global history of inequality from the Stone Age to today, Walter Scheidel shows that it never dies peacefully. The Great Leveler is the first book to chart the crucial role of violent shocks in reducing inequality over the full sweep of human history around the world. The &#8220;Four Horsemen&#8221; of leveling-mass-mobilization warfare, transformative revolutions, state collapse, and catastrophic plagues-have repeatedly destroyed the fortunes of the rich. Today, the violence that reduced inequality in the past seems to have diminished, and that is a good thing. But it casts serious doubt on the prospects for a more equal future. An essential contribution to the debate about inequality, The Great Leveler provides important new insights about why inequality is so persistent-and why it is unlikely to decline anytime soon.</p>
