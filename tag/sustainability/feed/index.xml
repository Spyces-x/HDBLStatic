										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Geoffrey West&#8217;s research centres on a quest to find unifying principles and patterns connecting everything, from cells and ecosystems to cities, social networks and businesses.    </p>
<p>                    Why do organisms and ecosystems scale with size in a remarkably universal and systematic fashion?    </p>
<p>                    Is there a maximum size of cities? Of animals and plants? What about companies?    </p>
<p>                    Can scale show us how to create a more sustainable future?    </p>
<p>                    By applying the rigour of physics to questions of biology, visionary physicist Geoffrey West found that despite the riotous diversity in the sizes of mammals, they are all, to a large degree, scaled versions of each other. This speaks to everything from how long we can expect to live to how many hours of sleep we need. He then made the even bolder move of exploring his work&#8217;s applicability to cities and to the business world. These investigations have led to powerful insights about the elemental natural laws that bind us together in profound ways, and how all complex systems are dancing to the same simple tune, however diverse and unrelated they may seem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the years following her role as the lead author of the international bestseller, Limits to Growth&#8211;the first book to show the consequences of unchecked growth on a finite planet&#8211; Donella Meadows remained a pioneer of environmental and social analysis until her untimely death in 2001. Meadows&#8217; newly released manuscript, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight for problem solving on scales ranging from the personal to the global. Edited by the Sustainability Institute&#8217;s Diana Wright, this essential primer brings systems thinking out of the realm of computers and equations and into the tangible world, showing readers how to develop the systems-thinking skills that thought leaders across the globe consider critical for 21st-century life. Some of the biggest problems facing the world&#8211;war, hunger, poverty, and environmental degradation&#8211;are essentially system failures. They cannot be solved by fixing one piece in isolation from the others, because even seemingly minor details have enormous power to undermine the best efforts of too-narrow thinking. While readers will learn the conceptual tools and methods of systems thinking, the heart of the book is grander than methodology. Donella Meadows was known as much for nurturing positive outcomes as she was for delving into the science behind global dilemmas. She reminds readers to pay attention to what is important, not just what is quantifiable, to stay humble, and to stay a learner. In a world growing ever more complicated, crowded, and interdependent, Thinking in Systems helps readers avoid confusion and helplessness, the first step toward finding proactive and effective solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don&#8217;t have an energy crisis. We have a consumption crisis. And this book, which takes aim at cherished assumptions regarding energy, offers refreshingly straight talk about what&#8217;s wrong with the way we think and talk about the problem. Though we generally believe we can solve environmental problems with more energy-more solar cells, wind turbines, and biofuels-alternative technologies come with their own side effects and limitations. How, for instance, do solar cells cause harm? Why can&#8217;t engineers solve wind power&#8217;s biggest obstacle? Why won&#8217;t contraception solve the problem of overpopulation lying at the heart of our concerns about energy, and what will?<br />
                    This practical, environmentally informed, and lucid book persuasively argues for a change of perspective. If consumption is the problem, as Ozzie Zehner suggests, then we need to shift our focus from suspect alternative energies to improving social and political fundamentals: walkable communities, improved consumption, enlightened governance, and, most notably, women&#8217;s rights. The dozens of first steps he offers are surprisingly straightforward. For instance, he introduces a simple sticker that promises a greater impact than all of the nation&#8217;s solar cells. He uncovers why carbon taxes won&#8217;t solve our energy challenges (and presents two taxes that could). Finally, he explores how future environmentalists will focus on similarly fresh alternatives that are affordable, clean, and can actually improve our well-being.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investing with Impact: Why Finance Is a Force for Good outlines the roadmap to reinvigorating a skeptical public and demoralized financial services industry by making the case that, contrary to popular misconception, finance is not the cause of the world&#8217;s problems; in fact, it can provide the solution. Author Jeremy Balkin presents the case that the finance industry can improve the state of the world by positively influencing the allocation of capital.  Investing With Impact explains the methodology of Balkin&#8217;s 6 E Paradigm, opening the toolbox to this revolutionary framework for the first time. In so doing, Balkin expands the impact investment universe, enabling mainstream capital to flow where opportunities generate positive investment returns and have demonstrable social impact.  Described by the Huffington Post as the &#8220;Anti-Wolf of Wall Street,&#8221; Balkin is challenging the status quo on Wall Street by leading the intellectual debate embracing the $1 trillion frontier impact investment market opportunity. The book demonstrates conclusively that, if we can change the culture in finance, we can change the world for the better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine a world in which the excess energy from one business would be used to heat another. Where buildings need less and less energy around the world, and where &#8220;regenerative&#8221; commercial buildings &#8211; ones that create more energy than they use &#8211; are being designed. A world in which environmentally sound products and processes would be more cost-effective than wasteful ones. A world in which corporations such as Costco, Nike, BP, and countless others are forming partnerships with environmental and social justice organizations to ensure better stewardship of the earth and better livelihoods in the developing world. Now, stop imagining &#8211; that world is already emerging.     </p>
<p>                    A revolution is underway in today&#8217;s organizations. As Peter Senge and his co-authors reveal in The Necessary Revolution, companies around the world are boldly leading the change from dead-end &#8220;business as usual&#8221; tactics to transformative strategies that are essential for creating a flourishing, sustainable world. There is a long way to go, but the era of denial has ended. Today&#8217;s most innovative leaders are recognizing that for the sake of our companies and our world, we must implement revolutionary&#8211;not just incremental&#8211;changes in the way we live and work.     </p>
<p>                    Brimming with inspiring stories from individuals and organizations tackling social and environmental problems around the globe, THE NECESSARY REVOLUTION reveals how ordinary people at every level are transforming their businesses and communities. By working collaboratively across boundaries, they are exploring and putting into place unprecedented solutions that move beyond just being &#8220;less bad&#8221; to creating pathways that will enable us to flourish in an increasingly interdependent world. Among the stories in these pages are the evolution of Sweden&#8217;s &#8220;Green Zone,&#8221; Alcoa&#8217;s water use reduction goals, GE&#8217;s ecoimagination initiative, and Seventh Generation&#8217;s decision to shift some of their advertising to youth-led social change programs.     </p>
<p>                    At its heart, THE NECESSARY REVOLUTION contains a wealth of strategies that individuals and organizations can use &#8212; specific tools and ways of thinking &#8212; to help us build the confidence and competence to respond effectively to the greatest challenge of our time. It is an essential guidebook for all of us who recognize the need to act and work together&#8211;now&#8211;to create a sustainable world, both for ourselves and for the generations to follow.</p>
