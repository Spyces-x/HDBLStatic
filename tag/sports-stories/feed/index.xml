										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back From the Dead     </p>
<p>                     Jason Chaser&#8217;s survival of the horrific &#8212; and suspicious &#8212; crash in the Italian Run was nothing short of a miracle, but it&#8217;s going to take more miracles to salvage his budding racing career. Only the top four students at the International Race School will qualify to compete in the New York Masters, the most prestigious race on the pro circuit, and the accident has cost Jason more than precious points in the standings.     </p>
<p>                     It&#8217;s also undermined his confidence, and Jason&#8217;s rivals are more than willing to take advantage of his weakness to knock him out of the running. Jason will have to outthink as well as outrace the competition to get to New York &#8212; and the toughest race of his life.    </p>
