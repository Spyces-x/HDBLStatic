										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Six-time world surfing champion, actor, and US heart-throb Kelly Slater tells of the struggles and triumphs he&#8217;s experienced throughout his life and how they have helped him to become one of the world&#8217;s most loved sports figures. From beach blanket bingo to Baywatch, surfing has fascinated people for years, and Kelly Slater is the sport&#8217;s newest star. He&#8217;s one of the world&#8217;s most popular surfers; his radical moves have revolutionised the sport. Born in Cocoa Beach, Florida, in 1972, he found surfing to be a great way to escape problems at home. When he was 11, his parents divorced. Slater and his brother, Sean, were raised by their suddenly single mother, who struggled to support two young sons. After Slater&#8217;s surfing career took off, he made the transition into acting and modelling. He spent a season starring on the popular television show Baywatch, where he won the hearts of women young and old, including Pamela Anderson, whom he dated for about a year. He has also been featured in Versace ads. In Pipe Dreams, he shares the stories that have influenced his life and have inspired him to overcome both personal and professional hurdles and achieve his dreams.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year, this is the bestselling story about a rowing team&#8217;s quest for Olympic gold in Nazi Germany.     </p>
<p>                    Cast aside by his family at an early age, abandoned and left to fend for himself in the woods of Washington State, young Joe Rantz turns to rowing as a way of escaping his past.    </p>
<p>                     What follows is an extraordinary journey, as Joe and eight other working-class boys exchange the sweat and dust of life in 1930s America for the promise of glory at the heart of Hitler&#8217;s Berlin. Stroke by stroke, a remarkable young man strives to regain his shattered self-regard, to dare again to trust in others &#8211; and to find his way back home.    </p>
<p>                     Told against the backdrop of the Great Depression, Daniel James Brown&#8217;s The Boys in the Boat is narrative non-fiction of the first order; a personal story full of lyricism and unexpected beauty that rises above the grand sweep of history, and captures instead the purest essence of what it means to be alive.    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;I really can&#8217;t rave enough about this book . . . I read the last fifty pages with white knuckles, and the last twenty-five with tears in my eyes&#8217; &#8211; David Laskin, author of The Children&#8217;s Blizzard and The Long Way Home.</p>
