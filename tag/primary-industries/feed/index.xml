<p>                    Based on ten years of surveying farming communities around the world, top New York chef Dan Barber&#8217;s The Third Plate offers a radical new way of thinking about food that will heal the land and taste incredible.    </p>
<p>                     The &#8216;first plate&#8217; was a classic meal centred on a large cut of meat with few vegetables. On the &#8216;second plate&#8217;, championed by the farm-to-table movement, meat is free-range and vegetables are locally sourced. It&#8217;s better-tasting, and better for the planet, but the second plate&#8217;s architecture is identical to that of the first. It, too, disrupts ecological balances, causing soil depletion and nutrient loss &#8211; it just isn&#8217;t a sustainable way to farm or eat.    </p>
<p>                     The &#8216;third plate&#8217; offers a solution: an integrated system of vegetable, cereal and livestock production that is fully supported &#8211; in fact, dictated &#8211; by what we choose to cook for dinner. The Third Plate is where good farming and good food intersect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sonia Faruqi, an Ivy League graduate and investment banker, had no idea that the night she arrived at the doorstep of a dairy farm would mark the beginning of a journey that would ultimately wind all the way around the world. Instead of turning away from the animal cruelty she came to witness, Sonia made the most courageous decision of her life: a commitment to change things.    </p>
<p>                     Driven by impulsive will and searing passion, Sonia left behind everything she knew and loved to search the planet for solutions to benefit animals, human health, and the environment. Over the course of living with farmers, hitchhiking with strangers, and risking her life, she developed surprising insights and solutions-both about the food industry and herself.    </p>
<p>                     Lively and heartfelt, Sonia takes readers on an unforgettable adventure from top-secret egg warehouses in Canada to dairy feedlots in the United States, from farm offices in Mexico to lush pastures in Belize, from flocks of village chickens in Indonesia to factory farms in Malaysia.    </p>
<p>                     Revelatory in scope, Project Animal Farm illuminates a hidden world that plays a part in all of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Pulls aside the curtain of puffery to show . . . the business of liquor to be every bit as fascinating as the fictions in which the distillers love to swaddle themselves.&#8221; &#8211;Wayne Curtis, The Wall Street Journal     </p>
<p>                     Walk into a well-stocked liquor store and you&#8217;ll see countless whiskey brands, each boasting an inspiring story of independence and heritage. And yet, more than 95% of the nation&#8217;s whiskey comes from a small handful of giant companies with links to organized crime, political controversy, and a colorful history that is far different than what appears on modern labels. In Bourbon Empire, Reid Mitenbuler shows how bourbon, America&#8217;s most iconic style of whiskey, and the industry surrounding it, really came to be&#8211;a saga of shrewd capitalism as well as dedicated craftsmanship.     </p>
<p>                     Mitenbuler traces the big names&#8211;Jim Beam, Maker&#8217;s Mark, Evan Williams, and more&#8211;back to their origins, exploring bourbon&#8217;s founding myths and great successes against the backdrop of America&#8217;s economic history. Illusion is separated from reality in a tale reaching back to the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, when the ideologies of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton battled to define the soul of American business. That debate continues today, punctuated along the way by Prohibition-era bootleggers, the liquor-fueled origins of NASCAR, intense consolidation driven by savvy lobbying, and a Madison Avenue plot to release five thousand parrots&#8211;trained to screech the name of a popular brand&#8211;into the nation&#8217;s bars.     </p>
<p>                     Today, the whiskey business takes a new turn as a nascent craft distilling movement offers the potential to revolutionize the industry once again. But, as Mitenbuler shows, many take advantage of this excitement while employing questionable business practices, either by masquerading whiskey made elsewhere as their own or by shortcutting the proven production standards that made many historic brands great to begin with.     </p>
<p>                     A tale of innovation, success, downfall, and resurrection, Bourbon Empire is an exploration of the spirit in all its unique forms, creating an indelible portrait of both American whiskey and the people who make it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Could everything we know about fossil fuels be wrong?     </p>
<p>                    For decades, environmentalists have told us that using fossil fuels is a self-destructive addiction that will destroy our planet. Yet at the same time, by every measure of human well-being, from life expectancy to clean water to climate safety, life has been getting better and better.     </p>
<p>                    How can this be?     </p>
<p>                    The explanation, energy expert Alex Epstein argues in The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels, is that we usually hear only one side of the story. We&#8217;re taught to think only of the negatives of fossil fuels, their risks and side effects, but not their positives&#8211;their unique ability to provide cheap, reliable energy for a world of seven billion people. And the moral significance of cheap, reliable energy, Epstein argues, is woefully underrated. Energy is our ability to improve every single aspect of life, whether economic or environmental.     </p>
<p>                    If we look at the big picture of fossil fuels compared with the alternatives, the overall impact of using fossil fuels is to make the world a far better place. We are morally obligated to use more fossil fuels for the sake of our economy and our environment.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on original insights and cutting-edge research, Epstein argues that most of what we hear about fossil fuels is a myth. For instance . . .     </p>
<p>                    Myth Fossil fuels are dirty.<br />
                    Truth The environmental benefits of using fossil fuels far outweigh the risks. Fossil fuels don&#8217;t take a naturally clean environment and make it dirty; they take a naturally dirty environment and make it clean. They don&#8217;t take a naturally safe climate and make it dangerous; they take a naturally dangerous climate and make it ever safer.     </p>
<p>                    Myth Fossil fuels are unsustainable, so we should strive to use &#8220;renewable&#8221; solar and wind.<br />
                    Truth The sun and wind are intermittent, unreliable fuels that always need backup from a reliable source of energy&#8211;usually fossil fuels. There are huge amounts of fossil fuels left, and we have plenty of time to find something cheaper.     </p>
<p>                    Myth Fossil fuels are hurting the developing world.<br />
                    Truth Fossil fuels are the key to improving the quality of life for billions of people in the developing world. If we withhold them, access to clean water plummets, critical medical machines like incubators become impossible to operate, and life expectancy drops significantly. Calls to &#8220;get off fossil fuels&#8221; are calls to degrade the lives of innocent people who merely want the same opportunities we enjoy in the West.     </p>
<p>                    Taking everything into account, including the facts about climate change, Epstein argues that &#8220;fossil fuels are easy to misunderstand and demonize, but they are absolutely good to use. And they absolutely need to be championed. . . . Mankind&#8217;s use of fossil fuels is supremely virtuous&#8211;because human life is the standard of value and because using fossil fuels transforms our environment to make it wonderful for human life.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An investigative journalist takes you inside the corporate meat industry&#8211;a shocking, in-depth report every American should read.     </p>
<p>                    How much do you know about the meat on your dinner plate? Journalist Christopher Leonard spent more than a decade covering the country&#8217;s biggest meat companies, including four years as the national agribusiness reporter for the Associated Press. Now he delivers the first comprehensive look inside the industrial meat system, exposing how a handful of companies executed an audacious corporate takeover of the nation&#8217;s meat supply.     </p>
<p>                    Leonard&#8217;s revealing account shines a light on the inner workings of Tyson Foods, a pioneer of the industrial system that dominates the market. You&#8217;ll learn how the food industry got to where it is today, and how companies like Tyson have escaped the scrutiny they deserve. You&#8217;ll discover how these companies are able to raise meat prices for consumers while pushing down the price they pay to farmers. And you&#8217;ll even see how big business and politics have derailed efforts to change the system, from a years-long legal fight in Iowa to the Obama administration&#8217;s recent failed attempt to pass reforms.     </p>
<p>                    Important, timely, and explosive, The Meat Racket is an unvarnished portrait of the food industry that now dominates America&#8217;s heartland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norman Borlaug was the only person during the twentieth century who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for work in agriculture and food. There is no Nobel Food Prize, so the Nobel Committee chose Dr. Borlaug as the 1970 recipient of the Peace Prize based on his dramatic scientific breakthroughs and wheat production technology that relieved hunger in much of the world. During the previous decade, many people on the planet Earth, most notably in China and the Asian Subcontinent, were facing starvation, even famine. Borlaug&#8217;s revolutionary achievements relieved widespread human suffering and brought peace.    </p>
<p>                    Dr. Borlaug was hailed as the person who saved the lives of more people&#8211;hundreds of millions&#8211;from starvation than any person in history. He earned the distinction as one of the 100 most influential individuals of the 20th century. His is an inspiring story; he went from an unpretentious Iowa farm boy to scientist-cum-humanist of world acclaim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marijuana legalization is the hottest story in the US today. 22 states have authorized sales in some form; Denver has more legal marijuana dispensaries than Starbucks franchises.

<p>                    Christian Hageseth is the face of the revolution-an entrepreneur and father of three who worked in the white-collar professional world for 20 years before opening his first dispensary. The Founder and Chairman of Green Man Cannabis, the fastest-growing legalized marijuana company in the country, he&#8217;s the perfect tour guide through the wild frontier, where police hardly know what laws to enforce, or parents what to tell their kids. He paints a colorful picture not only of how he got into the business, but of the big interests that are eager to do the same-namely Philip Morris, Monsanto and a who&#8217;s who of Big Pharma. He predicts a future where the marijuana market splits in two: the high-end, artisanal market, supplied by individual growers and small farms, and the mass market, covered by the cigarette giants and anyone bold enough to compete with them. Much like beer and coffee, your brand of weed will be just one more reflection of your lifestyle. It&#8217;s an entrepreneur&#8217;s dream, and Hageseth invites us along in Big Weed as he pitches skeptical investors, negotiates a shaggy cast of colleagues, and builds the biggest business he can.</p>
