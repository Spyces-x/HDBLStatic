<p>                    Oxford economist E. F. Schumacher provides an enlightening study of our economic system and its purpose, challenging the current state of excessive consumption in our society. Offering a crucial message for the modern world struggling to balance economic growth with the human costs of globalisation, Small Is Beautiful puts forward the revolutionary yet viable case for building our economies around the needs of communities, not corporations.     </p>

<p>                      In this groundbreaking book, trend forecaster James Wallman finds that a rising number of people are turning away from all-you-can-get consumption, from the exec who&#8217;s sold almost everything he owns, to the well-off family who moved to a remote mountain cabin.    </p>
<p>                      In Stuffocation, Wallman&#8217;s solution is to focus less on possessions and more on experiences. It is a manifesto for a vital change in how you live &#8211; and it&#8217;s the one book you won&#8217;t be able to live without.</p>

<p>                              By the time you&#8217;re twenty-one, you&#8217;ll have seen or heard a million advertisements. But you won&#8217;t be happier for it.    </p>
<p>                              This is a book about that much-maligned, much-misunderstood generation coming up behind the slackers, who are being intelligent and active about the world in which they find themselves. It is a world in which all that is &#8216;alternative&#8217; is sold, where any innovation or subversion is immediately adopted by un-radical, faceless corporations. But, gradually, tentatively, a new generation is beginning to fight consumerism with its own best weapons; and it is the first skirmishes in this war that this abrasively intelligent book documents brilliantly.</p>
