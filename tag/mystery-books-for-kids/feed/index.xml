										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Best book ever!&#8217; &#8211; 5-star reader review</p>
<p>Theodore Boone, young lawyer, has had a lot to deal with in his thirteen years, everything from kidnapping to murder. But he&#8217;s come through it all and, with the law on his side, justice has always prevailed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the law doesn&#8217;t seem so just. His friend Hardie Quinn is about to have his family home bulldozed to make way for a bypass. Hardie is not the only one affected: other homes, businesses and schools lie in the path of the road. Theo has to tell his friend the bad news: for once, the law isn&#8217;t on his side, and there&#8217;s very little anyone can do to end the destruction.</p>
<p>Theo joins the campaign to stop the road. But when he stumbles on a terrible secret about the corrupt men behind the plan  &#8211; a secret it is illegal for him to know &#8211;  Theo must figure out how to keep the developers from breaking the law . . . without breaking it himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Reptile Room the siblings endure a car accident, a terrible smell, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a brass reading lamp, and the re-appearance of a person they&#8217;d hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is nothing to be found in the pages of A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair.</p>
<p>                              You still have time to choose another international best-seller to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on &#8230;</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>***Perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz&#8217;s Alex Rider series***</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Not since Nancy Drew has a nosy, crime-obsessed kid been so hard to resist&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                     Woody Lambert is in trouble. He comes from a broken family, suffers bad grades at school and his older brother, Tony, is on probation for a drug offence. When Woody inadvertently gets caught up with Tony and one of his friends, Garth, cruising around Strattenburg in a beaten-up Mustang drinking beer, one thing leads to another and Garth holds up a convenience store with a fake gun. </p>
<p>                     Though he had no involvement in the crime other than being in Garth&#8217;s car, Woody is arrested as an accomplice. He&#8217;s going to need serious legal advice to avoid juvenile prison.</p>
<p>                     Enter Theodore Boone: after all, Theo has already decided that he will become the best courtroom lawyer in the state. It&#8217;s just that, at the age of thirteen, Theo is years from being a qualified lawyer &#8211; and Woody needs help right now . . . </p>
<p>                     ***********************</p>
<p>                     Further praise for the Theodore Boone series</p>
<p>                     &#8216;If you aspire to turn your children into lawyers who will keep you in your old age, John Grisham&#8217;s Theodore Boone, his first novel for young people, might be for you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                     &#8216;For any young readers tired of wizards, vampires and Greek gods, there&#8217;s now a new kid on the young fiction block, and this one really does have serious powers: Theodore Boone, half-boy, half-lawyer&#8230; fans will be pleased to know there will be more of Theo&#8217;s adventures to come&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Nobody does legal fiction better&#8217; &#8211; Daily Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Gripping . . . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. I think everyone will be enthralled by Theodore Boone&#8217; &#8211; Scholastic News</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Bad Beginning, the siblings encounter a greedy and repulsive villain, itchy clothing, a disastrous fire, a plot to steal their fortune and cold porridge for breakfast.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8217;s landlady, Mrs. Tupper, is the closest thing Enola has to family these days, besides her occasional run-ins with her brother Sherlock. Even though Mrs. Tupper is nearly deaf and can barely cook, she&#8217;s an endearing presence as Enola longs for her absent mother. So imagine her horror when Enola comes home to find Mrs. Tupper kidnapped! Who would take her, and why? And what does Florence Nightingale have to do with it? From the master of mystery Nancy Springer, here&#8217;s another absorbing adventure for our award-winning, unstoppable heroine, Enola Holmes. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Don&#8217;t miss the second series of His Dark Materials on BBC One this November.**</p>
<p>                    From the author of the phenomenal His Dark Materials comes the next chapter in the story of Lyra Silvertongue . . .</p>
<p>                     Lyra is now studying at St Sophia&#8217;s College, Oxford, with her daemon Pantalaimon. </p>
<p>                     But, for the first time there are serious divisions between the two.<br />
                    Lyra is questioning everything she once held dear. Pan misses the impulsiveness of their youth. </p>
<p>                     When an act of terrible violence breaks the peace of the Oxford night, Lyra and Pan&#8217;s relationship reaches a crisis and they are drawn, far from home, into the dangerous factions of a world they had no idea existed.</p>
<p>                     The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself and to grow up and make sense of the world around you. </p>
<p>                    This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.</p>
<p>                    *Exclusive to the paperback edition, Chris Wormell&#8217;s new original illustrations bring Lyra&#8217;s world vividly to life.*<br />
                     _____</p>
<p>                     Reviews for The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two:</p>
<p>                     &#8220;[Pullman] has created a fantasy world, made yet more satisfying in rigour and stylistic elegance. This is a book for getting older with&#8221; Guardian, Book of the Week</p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Secret Commonwealth is ablaze with light and life. The writing is exquisite; every sentence sings &#8230; To read Pullman is to experience the world refreshed, aglow, in Technicolour&#8221; i</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman&#8217;s story is still thought-provoking &#8230; This book elegantly weaves in live issues, from Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis to facts in the post-truth era. And Pullman&#8217;s prose is rewarding as ever&#8221; The Times</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A long, taxing, complex journey, laced with beauty, terror and philosophy&#8221; Metro</p>
<p>                     &#8220;As ever, Pullman&#8217;s story is complex and vast but home to some of the finest storytelling in the 21st century. Revel in whole new worlds and enjoy one of literature&#8217;s most wonderful heroines before she comes to HBO and the BBC&#8221; Stylist</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman is confronting readers with the horrors of our own world reflected back at us. In The Secret Commonwealthhe creates a fearful symmetry&#8221; The Herald</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Patterson returns to the genre that made him famous with a #1 New York Times bestselling teen detective novel about the mysterious Angel family . . . and the dark secrets they&#8217;re keeping from one another.<br />
                    On the night Malcolm and Maud Angel are murdered, Tandy Angel knows just three things: 1) She was the last person to see her parents alive. 2) The police have no suspects besides Tandy and her three siblings. 3) She can&#8217;t trust anyone-maybe not even herself.<br />
                    As Tandy sets out to clear the family name, she begins to recall flashes of experiences long buried in her vulnerable psyche. These memories shed light on her family&#8217;s dark secrets, and digging deeper into her powerful parents&#8217; affairs proves to be a disturbing and dangerous game. Who knows what any of the Angels are truly capable of?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

But Enola can&#8217;t help but investigate, especially when she learns that a bizarre bouquet&#8211;with flowers all symbolizing death&#8211;has been delivered to the Watson residence. Enola knows she must act quickly, but can she find Dr. Watson in time?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brought to you by Penguin.     </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for Audiobook of the Year at the British Book Awards 2020.    </p>
<p>                    Winner of Best Solo Narration at the New York Festival Radio Awards 2020    </p>
<p>                    It is twenty years since the events of La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One unfolded and saw the baby Lyra Belacqua begin her life-changing journey.     </p>
<p>                    It is almost ten years since readers left Lyra and the love of her young life, Will Parry, on a park bench in Oxford&#8217;s Botanic Gardens at the end of the ground-breaking, bestselling His Dark Materials sequence.     </p>
<p>                    Now, in The Secret Commonwealth, we meet Lyra Silvertongue. And she is no longer a child . . .    </p>
<p>                    The second volume of Philip Pullman&#8217;s The Book of Dust sees Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed. Pulled along on his own journey too is Malcolm; once a boy with a boat and a mission to save a baby from the flood, now a man with a strong sense of duty and a desire to do what is right.    </p>
<p>                    Theirs is a world at once familiar and extraordinary, and they must travel far beyond the edges of Oxford, across Europe and into Asia, in search for what is lost &#8211; a city haunted by daemons, a secret at the heart of a desert, and the mystery of the elusive Dust.    </p>
<p>                    The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself, to grow up and make sense of the world around you. This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Michael Sheen throws himself wholeheartedly into narrating this sequel to La Belle Sauvage and listeners will be rapt. For the ever-expanding international cast of characters, Sheen conjures a multitude of accents and delivers rapid-fire conversations between them. He&#8217;s in step with the text at every turn; when situations become fraught or dangerous, Sheen ramps up the tension exquisitely. Thanks to Pullman&#8217;s intricate storytelling and Sheen&#8217;s propulsive narration, listeners will be on the edge of their seats right up to the cliff-hanger ending&#8221; AudioFile</p>
