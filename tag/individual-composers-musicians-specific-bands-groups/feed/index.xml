										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Dyson&#8217;s incisive analysis of JAY-Z&#8217;s brilliance not only offers a brief history of hip-hop&#8217;s critical place in American culture, but also hints at how we can best move forward.&#8221; &#8211;Questlove    </p>
<p>                    JAY-Z: Made in America is the fruit of Michael Eric Dyson&#8217;s decade of teaching the work of one of the greatest poets this nation has produced, as gifted a wordsmith as Walt Whitman, Robert Frost and Rita Dove. But as a rapper, he&#8217;s sometimes not given the credit he deserves for just how great an artist he&#8217;s been for so long.<br />
                    This book wrestles with the biggest themes of JAY-Z&#8217;s career, including hustling, and it recognizes the way that he&#8217;s always weaved politics into his music, making important statements about race, criminal justice, black wealth and social injustice. As he enters his fifties, and to mark his thirty years as a recording artist, this is the perfect time to take a look at JAY-Z&#8217;s career and his role in making this nation what it is today. In many ways, this is JAY-Z&#8217;s America as much as it&#8217;s Pelosi&#8217;s America, or Trump&#8217;s America, or Martin Luther King&#8217;s America. JAY-Z has given this country a language to think with and words to live by.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The rock memoir of the decade&#8217; Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The rock star&#8217;s gloriously entertaining and candid memoir is a gift to the reader&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    In his first and only official autobiography, music icon Elton John reveals the truth about his extraordinary life, which is also the subject of the smash-hit film Rocketman. The result is Me &#8211; the joyously funny, honest and moving story of the most enduringly successful singer/songwriter of all time.<br />
                    ______________    </p>
<p>                    Christened Reginald Dwight, he was a shy boy with Buddy Holly glasses who grew up in the London suburb of Pinner and dreamed of becoming a pop star.  By the age of twenty-three, he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again.    </p>
<p>                    His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with songwriting partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with the Queen; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation. All the while, Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade.    </p>
<p>                    In Me Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father.   In a voice that is warm, humble and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes.  This is a story that will stay with you, by a living legend.<br />
                    ______________    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Self-deprecating, funny . . . You cannot help but enjoy his company throughout, temper tantrums and all&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Racy, pacy and crammed with scurrilous anecdotes &#8211; what more could you ask from the rocket man&#8217; Guardian (Book of the Week)    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Chatty, gossipy, amusing and at times brutally candid&#8217; Telegraph</p>
