										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The monumental bestseller Quiet has been recast in a new edition that empowers introverted kids and teens      </p>
<p>                     Susan Cain sparked a worldwide conversation when she published Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#8217;t Stop Talking. With her inspiring book, she permanently changed the way we see introverts and the way introverts see themselves.     </p>
<p>                     The original book focused on the workplace, and Susan realized that a version for and about kids was also badly needed. This book is all about kids&#8217; world&#8211;school, extracurriculars, family life, and friendship. You&#8217;ll read about actual kids who have tackled the challenges of not being extroverted and who have made a mark in their own quiet way. You&#8217;ll hear Susan Cain&#8217;s own story, and you&#8217;ll be able to make use of the tips at the end of each chapter. There&#8217;s even a guide at the end of the book for parents and teachers.     </p>
<p>                     This insightful, accessible, and empowering book, illustrated with amusing comic-style art, will be eye-opening to extroverts and introverts alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Readers of Innumeracy will be rewarded with scores of astonishing facts, a fistful of powerful ideas, and, most important, a clearer, more quantitative way of looking at their world.     </p>
<p>                    Why do even well-educated people understand so little about mathematics? And what are the costs of our innumeracy? John Allen Paulos, in his celebrated bestseller first published in 1988, argues that our inability to deal rationally with very large numbers and the probabilities associated with them results in misinformed governmental policies, confused personal decisions, and an increased susceptibility to pseudoscience of all kinds. Innumeracy lets us know what we&#8217;re missing, and how we can do something about it.     </p>
<p>                    Sprinkling his discussion of numbers and probabilities with quirky stories and anecdotes, Paulos ranges freely over many aspects of modern life, from contested elections to sports stats, from stock scams and newspaper psychics to diet and medical claims, sex discrimination, insurance, lotteries, and drug testing.</p>
