                    *A BBC Between the Covers book club pick*<br />
                    *Shortlisted for the 2018 Baillie Gifford Prize*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;THE BEST TRUE SPY STORY I HAVE EVER READ&#8217; JOHN LE CARRE        </p>
<p>                    An exciting Cold War story about a KGB double agent, by one of Britain&#8217;s greatest historians and the ultimate gift for anyone who loves a good spy thriller!    </p>
<p>                    On a warm July evening in 1985, a middle-aged man stood on the pavement of a busy avenue in the heart of Moscow, holding a plastic carrier bag. In his grey suit and tie, he looked like any other Soviet citizen. The bag alone was mildly conspicuous, printed with the red logo of Safeway, the British supermarket.    </p>
<p>                    The man was a spy. A senior KGB officer, for more than a decade he had supplied his British spymasters with a stream of priceless secrets from deep within the Soviet intelligence machine. No spy had done more to damage the KGB. The Safeway bag was a signal: to activate his escape plan to be smuggled out of Soviet Russia. So began one of the boldest and most extraordinary episodes in the history of spying. Ben Macintyre reveals a tale of espionage, betrayal and raw courage that changed the course of the Cold War forever&#8230;    </p>

                    WITH AN AFTERWORD BY JOHN LE CARRE    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Riveting, astounding &#8230; An unputdownable postwar thriller&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Irresistibly readable&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Worthy of John le Carre at his best&#8217; John Banville, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hugely engrossing &#8230; Both authoritative and enthralling&#8217; William Boyd<br />
                    ________________    </p>
<p>                    Kim Philby was the most notorious British defector and Soviet mole in history. Agent, double agent, charmer and traitor, he betrayed every secret of Allied operations to the Russians in the early years of the Cold War. In the aftermath of the Second World War, Philby, Nicholas Elliott and James Jesus Angleton were rising stars in the intelligence world and shared every secret. Elliott and Angleton thought they knew Philby better than anyone &#8211; and then discovered they had not known him at all.    </p>
<p>                    This is a story of loyalty, trust and treachery, class and conscience, of male friendships forged, and then systematically betrayed. With access to newly released MI5 files and previously unseen papers, A Spy Among Friends unlocks what is perhaps the last great secret of the Cold War.</p>
