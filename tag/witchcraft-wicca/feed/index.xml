										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s summer in Adders Fork. The sun is out, the sky is blue and things are going swimmingly for Rosie Strange, thank you very much. The Essex Witch Museum has been relaunched with a new Ursula Cadence wing and picnic grounds.     </p>
<p>                    Then developers roll into the sleepy village to widen the road. When the centuries-old Blackly Be boulder, said to mark the grave of a notorious witch but now in the car park of the Seven Stars, is moved, all hell breaks out. Within hours a slew of peculiar phenomena descends and, when a severed head is discovered atop the boulder, the locals can take no more and storm the Museum to demand someone take action.    </p>
<p>                    Can Rosie and Sam unravel the mystery? And what of the ancient treasure that could drastically change someone&#8217;s fortunes and offer a motive for murder?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The La Fleur restaurant has a slew of unusual phenomena. Bonnet-clad apparitions pass through walls, blood leaks from ceilings and rats besiege the dining room. Experts from the Great Essex Witch Museum are called in to quell these strange sights. But before Rosie Strange and Sam Stone can do their thing events turn darker. For La Fleur&#8217;s chef has been strung up and slaughtered like a pig. More oddly, the only witness, the owner&#8217;s daughter Mary, swears blind a ghost did it.       </p>
<p>                    Rosie and Sam must find out what&#8217;s happening before Mary takes the fall. But intuitions and tip-offs lead them stumbling into the dark waters of the past, exposing secrets of a wider conspiracy, as well as secrets all Rosie&#8217;s own. With strange chills Rosie and Sam learn that seeing isn&#8217;t always believing, while thoughts of truth may be just as illusory.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A treasure trove of practical magic for both novices and more experienced practitioners&#8230;beautifully crafted spells that invoke the alchemy of possibility.&#8211;PanGaia     </p>
<p>                    A leaf from an oak tree&#8230;a wildflower&#8230;water from a sparkling stream&#8230;dirt from a cool dark cave&#8211;these are the age-old tools of natural magic. Born of the earth, possessing inherent power, they await only our touch and intention to bring their magical qualities to life.     </p>
<p>                    The four elements are powerful magical tools. Using their energies, we can transform ourselves, our lives, and our world. This much-loved, classic guide offers more than seventy-five spells, rites, and simple rituals you can perform using the marvelous powers of the natural world.     </p>
<p>                    Scott Cunningham was a greatly respected teacher and one of the most influential members of the modern Craft movement. A practitioner of elemental magic for twenty years, he wrote more than fifty books, including the seminal Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.</p>
