<p>                    FATHOMLESS RICHES is the Reverend Richard Coles&#8217;s warm, witty and wise memoir in which he divulges with searing honesty and intimacy his pilgrimage from a rock-and-roll life of sex and drugs in the Communards to one devoted to God and Christianity. The result is one of the most unusual and readable life stories of recent times, and has the power to shock as well as to console.    </p>

<p>                    The Seven Storey Mountain tells of the growing restlessness of a brilliant and passionate young man, who at the age of twenty-six, takes vows in one of the most demanding Catholic orders&#8211;the Trappist monks. At the Abbey of Gethsemani, &#8220;the four walls of my new freedom,&#8221; Thomas Merton struggles to withdraw from the world, but only after he has fully immersed himself in it. At the abbey, he wrote this extraordinary testament, a unique spiritual autobiography that has been recognized as one of the most influential religious works of our time. Translated into more than twenty languages, it has touched millions of lives.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No other German has shaped the history of early-modern Europe more than Martin Luther.    </p>
<p>                    In this comprehensive and balanced biography we see Luther as a rebel, but not as a lone hero; as a soldier in a mighty struggle for the universal reform of Christianity and its role in the world. The foundation of Protestantism changed the religious landscape of Europe, and subsequently the world, but the author chooses to show not simply as a reformer, but as an individual.    </p>
<p>                    In his study of the Wittenberg monk, Heinz Schilling &#8211; one of Germany&#8217;s leading social and political historians &#8211; gives the reader a rounded view of a difficult, contradictory character, who changed the world by virtue of his immense will.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Name of God is Mercy, Pope Francis&#8217; exploration on the universal theme of mercy, is a spiritual inspiration to both followers of Christianity and non-Christians around the world.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own experience as a priest and shepherd, Pope Francis discusses mercy, a subject of central importance in his religious teaching and testimony, and in addition sums up other ideas &#8211; reconciliation, the closeness of God &#8211; that comprise the heart of his papacy. Written in conversation with Vatican expert and La Stampa journalist Andrea Tornielli, The Name of God is Mercy is directed at everyone, inside or outside of the Catholic Church, seeking meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, or the healing of physical or spiritual wounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer, and an accomplice of worldly secular powers. Her mission has always been of this kind. The irony is that she has never been able to induce anybody to believe her. It is past time that she was duly honored and taken at her word.     </p>
<p>                     Among his many books, perhaps none have sparked more outrage than The Missionary Position, Christopher Hitchens&#8217;s meticulous study of the life and deeds of Mother Teresa.     </p>
<p>                     A Nobel Peace Prize recipient beatified by the Catholic Church in 2003, Mother Teresa of Calcutta was celebrated by heads of state and adored by millions for her work on behalf of the poor. In his measured critique, Hitchens asks only that Mother Teresa&#8217;s reputation be judged by her actions-not the other way around.     </p>
<p>                     With characteristic élan and rhetorical dexterity, Hitchens eviscerates the fawning cult of Teresa, recasting the Albanian missionary as a spurious, despotic, and megalomaniacal operative of the wealthy who long opposed measures to end poverty, and fraternized, for financial gain, with tyrants and white-collar criminals throughout the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                    One of PW&#8217;s Best Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                    One of Amazon&#8217;s Best Books of the Month     </p>
<p>                    Why is religion still around in the twenty-first century? Why do so many still believe? And how do various traditions still shape the way people experience everything from sexuality to politics, whether they are religious or not? In Why Religion? Elaine Pagels looks to her own life to help address these questions.    </p>
<p>                    These questions took on a new urgency for Pagels when dealing with unimaginable loss&#8211;the death of her young son, followed a year later by the shocking loss of her husband. Here she interweaves a personal story with the work that she loves, illuminating how, for better and worse, religious traditions have shaped how we understand ourselves; how we relate to one another; and, most importantly, how to get through the most difficult challenges we face.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing upon the perspectives of neurologists, anthropologists, and historians, as well as her own research, Pagels opens unexpected ways of understanding persistent religious aspects of our culture.     </p>
<p>                    A provocative and deeply moving account from one of the most compelling religious thinkers at work today, Why Religion? explores the spiritual dimension of human experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The extraordinary life of the man who founded Islam, and the world he inhabited&#8211;and remade.     </p>
<p>                    Lesley Hazleton&#8217;s new book, Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto, is out now from Riverhead Books.     </p>
<p>                     Muhammad&#8217;s was a life of almost unparalleled historical importance; yet for all the iconic power of his name, the intensely dramatic story of the prophet of Islam is not well known. In The First Muslim, Lesley Hazleton brings him vibrantly to life. Drawing on early eyewitness sources and on history, politics, religion, and psychology, she renders him as a man in full, in all his complexity and vitality.     </p>
<p>                     Hazleton&#8217;s account follows the arc of Muhammad&#8217;s rise from powerlessness to power, from anonymity to renown, from insignificance to lasting significance. How did a child shunted to the margins end up revolutionizing his world? How did a merchant come to challenge the established order with a new vision of social justice? How did the pariah hounded out of Mecca turn exile into a new and victorious beginning? How did the outsider become the ultimate insider?     </p>
<p>                     Impeccably researched and thrillingly readable, Hazleton&#8217;s narrative creates vivid insight into a man navigating between idealism and pragmatism, faith and politics, nonviolence and violence, rejection and acclaim. The First Muslim illuminates not only an immensely significant figure but his lastingly relevant legacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The basis for a major documentary, two leading experts sound an urgent call for the radical reimagining of American education so we can equip students for the realities of the twenty-first-century economy.<br />
                         We prize academic achievement, pressuring our children to get into the &#8220;right&#8221; colleges, have the highest GPAs, and pursue advanced degrees. But while students may graduate with credentials, by and large they lack the competencies needed to be thoughtful, engaged citizens and to get good jobs in our rapidly evolving economy. Alarmingly, our methods of schooling crush the creativity and initiative young people really need to thrive in the twenty-first century.<br />
                         Now bestselling author and education expert Tony Wagner and venture capitalist Ted Dintersmith call for a complete overhaul of American schools, sharing insights and stories from the front lines. Their powerful, urgent message identifies the growing gap between credentials and competence-and offers a framework for change.<br />
                        Most Likely to Succeed presents a new vision of American education, one that puts wonder, creativity, and initiative at the very heart of the learning process and prepares students for today&#8217;s economy.</p>
