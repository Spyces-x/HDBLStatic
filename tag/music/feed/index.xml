										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>KISS has released thirty-seven records and sold 80 million albums worldwide. Gene Simmons has also acted in films and on television, has written and produced albums for other recording artists, has managed the recording career of, among others, Liza Minelli, and was founder and president of his own recording label, Simmons Records/RCA. He also launched his film and TV producing career with Detroit Rock City for New Line Cinema. Gene Simmons lives in Beverley Hills, California, and was recently the rock star teacher on Channel 4&#8217;s Rock School.    </p>
<p>                    Here for the first time Gene Simmons, the notorious mainman of the explosive rock and roll group KISS, tells his story. Delivered in Gene&#8217;s own honest, outrageous and uncensored voice, he tells of his early beginnings in Israel, of his arrival in New York at the age of eight, his first taste of 1950s pop culture and his developing thirst for fame, fun and girls. Undoubtedly one of the most infamous rock and roll legends alive, Gene tells the never before revealed story of KISS&#8217;s reign as the biggest and most popular band in the world. Finally, the real story of the man behind the make-up.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of The Changing Mind and The Organized Mind comes The New York Times bestseller which unravels the mystery of our perennial love affair with music    </p>
<p>                    *****    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;What do the music of Bach, Depeche Mode and John Cage fundamentally have in common?&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Music is an obsession at the heart of human nature, even more fundamental to our species than language.     </p>
<p>                    From Mozart to the Beatles, neuroscientist, psychologist and internationally-bestselling author Daniel Levitin reveals the role of music in human evolution, shows how our musical preferences begin to form even before we are born and explains why music can offer such an emotional experience.    </p>
<p>                    In This Is Your Brain On Music Levitin offers nothing less than a new way to understand music, and what it can teach us about ourselves.     </p>
<p>                    *****    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Music seems to have an almost wilful, evasive quality, defying simple explanation, so that the more we find out, the more there is to know . . . Daniel Levitin&#8217;s book is an eloquent and poetic exploration of this paradox&#8217; Sting    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;You&#8217;ll never hear music in the same way again&#8217; Classic FM magazine    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Music, Levitin argues, is not a decadent modern diversion but something of fundamental importance to the history of human development&#8217; Literary Review</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Music Works is David Byrne&#8217;s bestselling, buoyant celebration of a subject he has spent a lifetime thinking about. Drawing on his own work over the years with Talking Heads, Brian Eno, and his myriad collaborators &#8211; along with journeys to Wagnerian opera houses, African villages, and anywhere music exists &#8211; Byrne shows how music emerges from cultural circumstance as much as individual creativity. It is his magnum opus, and an impassioned argument about music&#8217;s liberating, life-affirming power.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this sweeping and dramatic narrative, Alex Ross, music critic for The New Yorker, weaves together the histories of the twentieth century and its music, from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties; from Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Stalin&#8217;s Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies up to the present. Taking readers into the labyrinth of modern style, Ross draws revelatory connections between the century&#8217;s most influential composers and the wider culture. The Rest is Noise is an astonishing history of the twentieth century as told through its music.</p>
