										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this fascinating foray into the millennia-long relationship between science and military power, acclaimed astrophysicist and &#8220;the world&#8217;s best science communicator&#8221; (Times Literary Supplement) Neil deGrasse Tyson and writer-researcher Avis Lang examine how the methods and tools of astrophysics have been enlisted in the service of war. &#8220;The overlap is strong, and the knowledge flows in both directions&#8221;, say the authors, because astrophysicists and military planners care about many of the same things: multi-spectral detection, ranging, tracking, imaging, high ground, nuclear fusion and access to space. Tyson and Lang call it a &#8220;curiously complicit&#8221; alliance. &#8220;The universe is both the ultimate frontier and the highest of high grounds&#8221;, they write. &#8220;Shared by both space scientists and space warriors, it&#8217;s a laboratory for one and a battlefield for the other. The explorer wants to understand it; the soldier wants to dominate it. But without the right technology-which is more or less the same technology for both parties-nobody can get to it, operate in it, scrutinise it, dominate it or use it to their advantage and someone else&#8217;s disadvantage.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                     Spanning early celestial navigation to satellite-enabled warfare, Accessory to War is a richly researched and provocative examination of the intersection of science, technology, industry and power that will introduce Tyson&#8217;s millions of fans to yet another dimension of how the universe has shaped our lives and our world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill Bryson describes himself as a reluctant traveller: but even when he stays safely in his own study at home, he can&#8217;t contain his curiosity about the world around him. A Short History of Nearly Everything is his quest to find out everything that has happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization &#8211; how we got from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. </p>
<p>                    Bill Bryson&#8217;s challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry and particle physics, and see if there isn&#8217;t some way to render them comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be interested in science. It&#8217;s not so much about what we know, as about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the centre of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure these things out?</p>
<p>                    On his travels through time and space, he encounters a splendid collection of astonishingly eccentric, competitive, obsessive and foolish scientists, like the painfully shy Henry Cavendish who worked out many conundrums like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most of us have never seen it before.</p>

<p>                    Where are we? Who are we? Do our beliefs, hopes and dreams hold any significance out there in the void? Can human purpose and meaning ever fit into a scientific worldview?    </p>
<p>                    Award-winning author Sean Carroll brings his extraordinary intellect to bear on the realms of knowledge, the laws of nature and the most profound questions about life, death and our place in it all.    </p>
<p>                    From Darwin and Einstein to the origins of life, consciousness and the universe itself, Carroll combines cosmos-sprawling science and profound thought in a quest to explain our world. Destined to sit alongside the works of our greatest thinkers, The Big Picture demonstrates that while our lives may be forever dwarfed by the immensity of the universe, they can be redeemed by our capacity to comprehend it and give it meaning.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The perfect antidote to the fluff and nonsense around right now. Learn how the world is and how you might just fit in&#8217; Simon Mayo    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;By God, it&#8217;s beguiling&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    These seven short lessons guide us, with simplicity and clarity, through the scientific revolution that shook physics in the twentieth century and still continues to shake us today. In this mind-bending overview of modern physics, Carlo Rovelli explains Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity, quantum mechanics, black holes, the complex architecture of the universe, elementary particles, gravity, and the nature of the mind. Not since Richard Feynman&#8217;s celebrated Six Easy Pieces has physics been so vividly, intelligently and entertainingly revealed.    </p>
<p>                    Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre</p>
