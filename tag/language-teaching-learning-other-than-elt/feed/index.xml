										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NATIONAL BESTSELLER &#8211; For anyone who wants to learn a foreign language, this is the method that will finally make the words stick.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A brilliant and thoroughly modern guide to learning new languages.&#8221;&#8211;Gary Marcus, cognitive psychologist and author of the New York Times bestseller Guitar Zero     </p>
<p>                    At thirty years old, Gabriel Wyner speaks six languages fluently. He didn&#8217;t learn them in school&#8211;who does? Rather, he learned them in the past few years, working on his own and practicing on the subway, using simple techniques and free online resources&#8211;and here he wants to show others what he&#8217;s discovered.     </p>
<p>                    Starting with pronunciation, you&#8217;ll learn how to rewire your ears and turn foreign sounds into familiar sounds. You&#8217;ll retrain your tongue to produce those sounds accurately, using tricks from opera singers and actors. Next, you&#8217;ll begin to tackle words, and connect sounds and spellings to imagery rather than translations, which will enable you to think in a foreign language. And with the help of sophisticated spaced-repetition techniques, you&#8217;ll be able to memorize hundreds of words a month in minutes every day.     </p>
<p>                    This is brain hacking at its most exciting, taking what we know about neuroscience and linguistics and using it to create the most efficient and enjoyable way to learn a foreign language in the spare minutes of your day.</p>
