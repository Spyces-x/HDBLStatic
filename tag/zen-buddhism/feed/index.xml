Here he shows us how&#8211;in an age of unprecedented anxiety&#8211;we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life.    </p>
<p>                    Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not&#8211;and cannot&#8211;know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of &#8216;writing beautifully the unwritable.'&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                    FEATURED ON THE DELICIOUSLY ELLA PODCAST    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re all on a search for happiness, but we&#8217;re looking in the wrong places.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone looks externally to find contentment, we think material possessions will unlock our happiness. A Monk&#8217;s Guide to Happiness explains how and why we need to look within, and connect to our true essence, in order to find peace. Everyone has the potential to be happy, after all, we&#8217;re all &#8216;hardwired&#8217; for happiness.    </p>
<p>                    But how do we get there? By meditating. Not just in the morning, but throughout the day by introducing micro moments so we never drop the mindfulness ball, even when we&#8217;re busy. Meditation is more than just a stress-reduction tool or a relaxation therapy, it is the key to finding long-lasting happiness.    </p>
<p>                    Gelong Thubten, a Buddhist monk who has worked with everyone from Silicon Valley entrepreneurs to Ruby Wax and Benedict Cumberbatch, explores the theme of happiness in his debut book and explains how to bring meditation into our busy 21st century lives with simple exercises.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thubten is a very generous and kind monk who writes with the lived honesty and humour of someone who has experienced the wisdom he shares. His writing is full of inspiration but also the pragmatism needed to form a sustainable practice. His book clearly illustrates why we all need meditation and mindfulness in our lives.&#8217; &#8211; Benedict Cumberbatch</p>
