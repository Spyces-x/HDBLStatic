										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Professional journalist and amateur drinker Bianca Bosker didn&#8217;t know much about wine &#8211; until she discovered the world of elite sommeliers who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of flavour. Astounded by their fervour and seemingly superhuman sensory powers, she set out to uncover what drove their obsession, and whether she, too, could become a &#8216;cork dork.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    With boundless curiosity, humour and a healthy dose of scepticism, Bosker takes the reader inside underground tasting groups, exclusive New York City restaurants, California mass-market wine factories and even a neuroscientist&#8217;s fMRI machine as she attempts to answer the most nagging question of all: what&#8217;s the big deal about wine?     </p>
<p>                    Funny, counterintuitive and compulsively readable, Cork Dork not only illuminates wine production and consumption, but also shows how cultivating our taste buds can have enormous ramifications for both our brains and our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Garlic has been used throughout history as a nourishing food and a magical medicine, healing everything from toothaches to dysentery. For much of this past century many dismissed its medicinal qualities as folk remedies more efficiently replaced by modern drugs &#8212; but today garlic is undergoing a renaissance. Not only are more people cooking with garlic, they are also growing it in their backyards. And scientists are studying garlic&#8217;s antibiotic, antifungal, and antiparasitic qualities, as well as its potential for cancer treatment. In Pursuit of Garlic tells Liz Primeau&#8217;s story of her love affair with the divinely odorous bulb and leads us on a tour of garlic&#8217;s role in history, art, medicine, and science. Primeau shares her favorite garlic-centered recipes, visits garlic fairs, discusses the many varieties of garlic &#8212; from Russian Red to German Brown to Kettle River Giant &#8212; and gives invaluable tips for growing your own.</p>
