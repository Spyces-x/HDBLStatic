<p>                    When poor farm boy Eragon finds a polished stone in the forest, he thinks it&#8217;s a lucky discovery. Perhaps, he will be able to buy his family food for the winter.     </p>
<p>                    But, when a baby dragon hatches out of the stone, Eragon realises he&#8217;s stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.     </p>
<p>                    His simple life is shattered, and he&#8217;s thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic and power. To navigate this dark terrain, and survive his cruel king&#8217;s evil ways, he must take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders.     </p>
<p>                    Will he succeed? The fate of the Empire rests in his hands. . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the colossal battle against the Empire&#8217;s warriors, Eragon and Saphira narrowly escaped with their lives. But more awaits the Rider and his dragon, as Eragon finds himself bound by promises he may not be able to keep, including his oath to cousin Roran to help rescue his beloved Katrina. When unrest claims the rebels and danger strikes, Eragon must make choices that take him across the Empire and beyond, choices that may lead to unimagined sacrifice.    </p>
<p>                    Conflict, action, adventure and one devastating death await readers as Eragon battles on behalf of the Varden while Galbatorix ruthlessly attempts to crush and twist him to his own purposes. Can he become a leader who can unite the rebel forces and defeat the King?    </p>

<p>                    Fresh from their battle for the rebel state against King Galbatorix, Eragon has no time to rest. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It began with Eragon . . . It ends with Inheritance.    </p>
<p>                    Not so very long ago, Eragon &#8211; Shadeslayer, Dragon Rider &#8211; was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now, the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.    </p>
<p>                    Long months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.     </p>
<p>                    The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaesia? And if so, at what cost?    </p>
<p>                    Featuring spectacular artwork by cult artist John Jude Palencar, this stunning book brings the bestselling Inheritance cycle to a breathtaking conclusion.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unpredictable events of a particular Tuesday unroll before the reader with the precision and clarity of a silent movie.   A Caldecott Medal book.  AUTHOR: David Wiesner is one of the best-loved and most highly acclaimed picture book creators in the world. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages and have won numerous awards in the United States and abroad. Three of the picture books he both wrote and illustrated became instant classics when they won the prestigious Caldecott Medal: Tuesday in 1992, The Three Pigs in 2002, and Flotsam in 2007, making him only the second person in the award&#8217;s long history to have won three times. He has also received two Caldecott Honors, for Free Fall and Sector 7.  REVIEWS: &#8220;Kids will love its lighthearted, meticulously imagined, fun-without-a-moral fantasy. Tuesday is bound to take off.&#8221; School Library Journal, Starred    </p>

<p>                    Join us on this incredible time-travel adventure!     </p>
<p>                     Liberty, my wisecracking horse, our old friends Cam, Tommy, Freedom, and I are off to meet some super-brave soldiers in the year 1775. Yep, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll be visiting with the underdog heroes who fought for American independence, against all odds&#8211;and won! But not before eight very real years of danger and uncertainty. Be a part of Rush Revere&#8217;s crew as we rush, rush, rush into a time when British rule had become a royal pain, and rebellion was in the air. We&#8217;ll be on hand to see two lanterns hung in the Old North Church, prevent a British spy from capturing Paul Revere, and grapple with danger at the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.     </p>
<p>                     The extra special part of this trip is that right here in the twenty-first century, Cam&#8217;s dad is a soldier fighting in Afghanistan, and Cam has been pretty angry that he is away. Visiting with exceptional American heroes like Dr. Joseph Warren and George Washington, racing along after Paul Revere on his midnight ride, and seeing the Declaration of Independence signed make Cam see his own dad in a new and special way.     </p>
<p>                     But don&#8217;t worry. Along with the danger, excitement, and patriotism, there will still be time to stop for a delicious spinach, oats, and alfalfa smoothie. No, wait&#8211;that one&#8217;s for Liberty. The kids and I voted for strawberries.     </p>
<p>                     Now let&#8217;s open the magic portal to the past!</p>
