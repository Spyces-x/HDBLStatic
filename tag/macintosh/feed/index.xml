										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Segall put the &#8216;i&#8217; in iPad. Now he explains why simplicity is the secret of Apple&#8217;s success in Insanely Simple.    </p>
<p>                    To Steve Jobs, Simplicity wasn&#8217;t just a design principle. It was a religion and a weapon. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. It&#8217;s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011, and guides the way Apple is organized, how it designs products, and how it connects with customers. It&#8217;s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.    </p>
<p>                    As creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple&#8217;s resurrection, helping to create such critical campaigns as &#8216;Think Different&#8217; and naming the iMac. Insanely Simple is his insider&#8217;s view of Jobs&#8217; world. It reveals the ten elements of Simplicity that have driven Apple&#8217;s success &#8211; which you can use to propel your own organisation. Reading Insanely Simple, you&#8217;ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You&#8217;ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A blueprint for running a company the Steve Jobs way &#8230; should be required reading for anyone interested in management and marketing&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Punchy &#8230; Segall gets inside Apple&#8217;s branding and marketing to explain its directness and power&#8217;  Financial Times     </p>
<p>                    Ken Segall worked closely with Steve Jobs as ad agency creative director for NeXT and Apple. He was a member of the team that created Apple&#8217;s legendary &#8216;Think Different&#8217; campaign, and he&#8217;s responsible for that little &#8220;i&#8221; that&#8217;s a part of Apple&#8217;s most popular products. Segall has also served as creative director for IBM, Intel, Dell, and BMW. He blogs about technology and marketing at kensegall.com/blog, and has fun with it all at scoopertino.com.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES AND #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER &#8211; with a new foreword by Silicon Valley legend Marc Andreessen.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;For my money, a better book about Jobs than Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography&#8217; New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating reinterpretation of the Steve Jobs story&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    We all think we know who Steve Jobs was, what made him tick, and what made him succeed.     </p>
<p>                    Yet the single most important question about him has never been answered.     </p>
<p>                    The young, impulsive, egotistical genius was ousted in the mid-80s from the company he founded, exiled from his own kingdom and cast into the wilderness. Yet he returned a decade later to transform the ailing Apple into the most successful company the world had ever seen.     </p>
<p>                    How did this reckless upstart transform himself into a visionary business leader?     </p>
<p>                    The first comprehensive study of Jobs&#8217; career following his dismissal from Apple, written with unparalleled access and insight, BECOMING STEVE JOBS offers a startling new portrait of the most important business figure in modern history. The most intimate biography yet of Jobs, written by the journalist who knew him better than any other, BECOMING STEVE JOBS draws on recently discovered interviews that have never before seen the light of day, and answers for the first time the most pressing questions about what made this legendary business leader such a success.</p>
