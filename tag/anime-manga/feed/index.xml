										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Comic legend Alan Moore&#8217;s highly-influential classic of British comics, presented to a new generation coloured and remastered for the very first time. &#8220;Where did she go? Out. What did she do? Everything&#8230;&#8221; Bored and frustrated with her life in 50th-century leisure-ghetto housing estate `The Hoop&#8217;, 18-year-old everywoman Halo Jones yearns for the infinite sights and sounds of the universe. Pledging to escape on a fantastic voyage, she sets in motion events unimaginable; a spell on a luxury space-liner, a brush with an interstellar war &#8211; Halo Jones faces hardship and adventure in the name of freedom in the limitless cosmos. A galaxy-spanning story, comics&#8217; first bona fide feminist space opera, and the first true epic to grace the bibliography of arguably the greatest comic book writer the world has ever known.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The classic masterpiece by #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King&#8211;illustrated by the legendary artist Bernie Wrightson!     </p>
<p>                    Terror began in January&#8211;by the light of the full moon&#8230;     </p>
<p>                    The first scream came from the snowbound railwayman who felt the werewolf&#8217;s fangs ripping at his throat. The next month there was a scream of ecstatic agony from the woman attacked in her cozy bedroom. Now scenes of unbelievable horror unfold each time the full moon shines on the isolated Maine town of Tarker&#8217;s Mills. No one knows who will be attacked next. But one thing is sure. When the full moon rises, a paralyzing fear sweeps through Tarker&#8217;s Mills. For snarls that sound like human words can be heard whining through the wind. And all around are the footprints of a monster whose hunger cannot be sated&#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 Kindle Bestseller on Amazon.com     </p>
<p>                    Winner of Kindle Book Review&#8217;s Best Indie Book of 2012 Award     </p>
<p>                    Wool as you&#8217;ve never read it before: The New York Times bestselling novel now told in graphic novel format featuring full-color illustrations by Hugo Award-nominated artist Jimmy Broxton, and as adapted by fan-favorite writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. This contemporary dystopian classic&#8211;hailed by Justin Cronin, New York Times bestselling author of The Passage, as &#8220;an epic feat of imagination&#8221;&#8211;will captivate readers both familiar and new.     </p>
<p>                    This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.    </p>

<p>A dance at Greg&#8217;s middle school has everyone scrambling to find a partner, and Greg is determined not to be left by the wayside. So he concocts a desperate plan to find someone anyone! to go with on the big night.</p>
<p>But Greg&#8217;s schemes go hilariously awry, and his only option is to attend the dance with his best friend, Rowley Jefferson, and a female classmate as a &#8220;group of friends.&#8221; But the night is long, and anything can happen along the way. Who will arrive at the dance triumphantly, and who will end up being the third wheel?</p>
