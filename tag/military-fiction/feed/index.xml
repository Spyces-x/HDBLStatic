										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times bestseller</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of the strongest and most affecting works in Allende&#8217;s long career&#8217; New York Times Book Review</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A defiantly warm and funny novel, by somebody who has earned the right to argue that love and optimism can survive whatever history might throw at us&#8217; Daily Telegraph</p>
<p>                    September 3, 1939, the day of the Spanish exiles&#8217; splendid arrival in Chile, the Second World War broke out in Europe.</p>
<p>                    Victor Dalmau is a young doctor when he is caught up in the Spanish Civil War, a tragedy that leaves his life &#8211; and the fate of his country &#8211; forever changed. Together with his sister-in-law, the pianist Roser, he is forced out of his beloved Barcelona and into exile. </p>
<p>                    When opportunity to seek refuge arises, they board a ship chartered by the poet Pablo Neruda to Chile, the promised &#8216;long petal of sea and wine and snow&#8217;. There, they find themselves enmeshed in a rich web of characters who come together in love and tragedy over the course of four generations, destined to witness the battle between freedom and repression as it plays out across the world.</p>
<p>                    A masterful work of historical fiction that soars from the Spanish Civil War to the rise and fall of Pinochet, A Long Petal of the Sea is Isabel Allende at the height of her powers.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;An epic that starts in 1939 and spans decades and continents . . . A masterful work of historical fiction about hope, exile and belonging, and one that sheds light on the way we live now&#8217; Independent.co.uk</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Full of ambition and humanity&#8217; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Allende knows that all stories are love stories, and the greatest love stories are told by time&#8217; Colum McCann</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Allende&#8217;s style is impressively Olympian and the payoff is remarkable&#8217; Guardian</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Epic in scope, yet intimate in execution&#8217; i</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the second part of John le Carre&#8217;s Karla Trilogy, the battle of wits between spymaster George Smiley and his Russian adversary takes on an even more dangerous dimension.</p>
<p>                     As the fall of Saigon looms, master spy George Smiley must outmaneuver his Soviet counterpart on a battlefield that neither can afford to lose.</p>
<p>                     The mole has been eliminated, but the damage wrought has brought the British Secret Service to its knees. Given the charge of the gravely compromised Circus, George Smiley embarks on a campaign to uncover what Moscow Centre most wants to hide. When the trail goes cold at a Hong Kong gold seam, Smiley dispatches Gerald Westerby to shake the money tree. A part-time operative with cover as a philandering journalist, Westerby insinuates himself into a war-torn world where allegiances-and lives-are bought and sold.</p>
<p>                    Brilliantly plotted and morally complex, The Honourable Schoolboy is the second installment of John le Carre&#8217;s renowned Karla triology and a riveting portrayal of postcolonial espionage.</p>
<p>                     With an introduction by the author.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chosen as a Book of the Year in The Times Literary Supplement, the Evening Standard, the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A brilliant novel of deception, love and trust to join his supreme cannon&#8217; Evening Standard</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Vintage le Carre. Immensely clever, breathtaking. Really, not since The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has le Carre exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect&#8217; John Banville, Guardian</p>
<p>                    Peter Guillam, former disciple of George Smiley in the British Secret Service, has long retired to Brittany when a letter arrives, summoning him to London. The reason? Cold War ghosts have come back to haunt him. Intelligence operations that were once the toast of the Service are to be dissected by a generation with no memory of the Berlin Wall.  Somebody must pay for innocent blood spilt in the name of the greater good . . .</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Utterly engrossing and perfectly pitched. There is only one le Carre. Eloquent, subtle, sublimely paced&#8217;  Daily Mail</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Splendid, fast-paced, riveting&#8217; Andrew Marr, Sunday Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Remarkable. It gives the reader, at long last, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that have been missing for 54 years. Like wine, le Carre&#8217;s writing has got richer with age&#8217;  The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perhaps the most significant novelist of the second half of the 20th century in Britain. He&#8217;s in the first rank&#8217;  Ian McEwan</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of those writers who will be read a century from now&#8217;  Robert Harris</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An instant #1 New York Times Bestseller and a USA Today and Indie Bestseller! </p>
<p>                    The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s #1 New York Times bestselling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game. </p>
<p>                    After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar&#8217;s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move. </p>
<p>                    Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin&#8217;s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength. </p>
<p>                    At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition&#8217;s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A young girl called Tozi stands at the bottom of a pyramid, waiting to be led to the top where her heart will be cut out&#8230;</p>
<p>                    Pepillo, a Spanish orphan who serves a sadistic Dominican friar, is aboard the Spanish fleet as it sails towards Mexico&#8230;</p>
<p>                    This is the epic story of the clash of two empires, two armies and two gods of war. Five hundred desperate adventurers are about to pit themselves against the most brutal armies of the ancient Americas, armies hundreds of thousands strong. </p>
<p>                    This is a war of gods and men. Dark powers that work behind the scenes of history show their hand as the prophecy of the return of Quetzalcoatl is fulfilled with the arrival of Cortes. The Aztec ruler Moctezuma fights to maintain the demands of the war god Huitzilopochtli for human sacrifice. The Spanish Inquisition is planning an even greater blood-letting. </p>
<p>                    Caught up in the headlong collision between two gods of war are Tozi, Pepillo and the beautiful Malinal whose hatred of Moctezuma runs so deep she will sell out her own land and people to destroy him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An instant #1 New York Times Bestseller and a USA Today and Indie Bestseller! </p>
<p>                    The Stormlight Archive saga continues in Rhythm of War, the eagerly awaited sequel to Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s #1 New York Times bestselling Oathbringer, from an epic fantasy writer at the top of his game. </p>
<p>                    After forming a coalition of human resistance against the enemy invasion, Dalinar Kholin and his Knights Radiant have spent a year fighting a protracted, brutal war. Neither side has gained an advantage, and the threat of a betrayal by Dalinar&#8217;s crafty ally Taravangian looms over every strategic move. </p>
<p>                    Now, as new technological discoveries by Navani Kholin&#8217;s scholars begin to change the face of the war, the enemy prepares a bold and dangerous operation. The arms race that follows will challenge the very core of the Radiant ideals, and potentially reveal the secrets of the ancient tower that was once the heart of their strength. </p>
<p>                    At the same time that Kaladin Stormblessed must come to grips with his changing role within the Knights Radiant, his Windrunners face their own problem: As more and more deadly enemy Fused awaken to wage war, no more honorspren are willing to bond with humans to increase the number of Radiants. Adolin and Shallan must lead the coalition&#8217;s envoy to the honorspren stronghold of Lasting Integrity and either convince the spren to join the cause against the evil god Odium, or personally face the storm of failure. </p>

<p>                    In 1906, the western states of America suffer a string of bank robberies by a single man who then cold-bloodedly murders any and all witnesses, and vanishes without a trace. Fed up by the depredations of &#8220;The Butcher Bandit,&#8221; the U.S. government brings in the best man it can find: a tall, lean, no-nonsense detective named Isaac Bell, who has caught thieves and killers from coast to coast.    </p>
<p>                     But Bell has never had a challenge like this one. From Arizona to Colorado to the streets of San Francisco during its calamitous earthquake and fire, he pursues a fiend who seems to draw pleasure from the challenge and a woman who may to hold the key to the man&#8217;s identity. As Bell begins to suspect a new term used among top psychologists, sociopath, may describe his target, the Butcher Bandit turns the chase around on him. The hunter becomes the hunted. And soon, it will take all of Bell&#8217;s skills not merely to prevail . . . but to survive.    </p>
<p>                     Filled with intricate plotting, Cussler&#8217;s signature dazzling set pieces, and not one but two extraordinary villains, The Chase is the master working at the height of his powers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you&#8217;re a Delta Force soldier, you see a lot. Often too much. But nothing can ever prepare you to see your entire team die before your eyes&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    The loss of his Delta brothers-and his arm-has Dane &#8220;Fish&#8221; Munroe still struggling months later. He&#8217;s moved to Idaho, where an isolated lifestyle is making things worse, not better. Not that there&#8217;s anyone left to care.    </p>
<p>                    Actually, Bryn Hartwell cares. In fact, she tries to surreptitiously make life just a little easier for the mysterious man who comes into the grocery where she works late at night, only to get a tongue lashing for her trouble. Still, he&#8217;s obviously hurting; someone has to worry about him, spurring Bryn to nurse Dane when he hits a particularly low point.    </p>
<p>                    Intrigued by the quirky, kind, socially awkward woman, Dane allows himself to get close to someone for the first time in ages. A potentially epic mistake-because when her interest in the prepper lifestyle puts Bryn in the hands of a homegrown terrorist, losing her could put Dane&#8217;s mental recovery permanently out of reach.    </p>
<p>                    But once a Delta, always a Delta. And there&#8217;s a team in Texas who are ready to have Dane&#8217;s back at a moment&#8217;s notice.    </p>
<p>                    **Rescuing Bryn is the 6th book in the Delta Force Heroes Series. Each book is a stand-alone, with no cliffhanger endings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The one and only Conn Iggulden takes on the story of the mighty Kublai Khan. An epic tale of a great and heroic mind; his action-packed rule; and how in conquering one-fifth of the world&#8217;s inhabited land, he changed the course of history forever. A scholar who conquered an empire larger than those of Alexander or Caesar. A warrior who would rule a fifth of the world with strength and wisdom. A man who betrayed a brother to protect a nation. From a young scholar to one of history&#8217;s most powerful warriors, Conqueror tells the story of Kublai Khan &#8211; an extraordinary man who should be remembered alongside Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte as one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever known. It should have been a golden age, with an empire to dwarf the lands won by the mighty Genghis Khan. Instead, the vast Mongol nation is slowly losing ground, swallowed whole by their most ancient enemy. A new generation has arisen, yet the long shadow of the Great Khan still hangs over them all &#8230;Kublai dreams of an empire stretching from sea to sea. But to see it built, this scholar must first learn the art of war.<br />
                    He must take his nation&#8217;s warriors to the ends of the known world. And when he is weary, when he is wounded, he must face his own brothers in bloody civil war.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The brilliantly original new novel from Michael Chabon, author of THE ADVENTURES OF KAVALIER &#038; CLAY and WONDER BOYS.    </p>
<p>                              What if, as Franklin Roosevelt once proposed, Alaska &#8211; and not Israel &#8211; had become the homeland for the Jews after the Second World War? In Michael Chabon&#8217;s Yiddish-speaking &#8216;Alyeska&#8217;, Orthodox gangs in side-curls and knee breeches roam the streets of Sitka, where Detective Meyer Landsman discovers the corpse of a heroin-addled chess prodigy in the flophouse Meyer calls home. Marionette strings stretch back to the hands of charismatic Rebbe Gold, leader of a sect that seems to have drawn its mission statement from the Cosa Nostra. Meyer is determined to unsnarl the meaning behind the murder. Even if that means surrendering his badge and his dignity to the chief of Sitka&#8217;s homicide unit &#8211; his fearsome ex-wife Bina.    </p>
<p>                              A novel of colossal ambition and heart, THE YIDDISH POLICEMEN&#8217;S UNION interweaves a homage to the stylish menace of 1940s film noir with a bittersweet fable of identity, home and faith.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of THE PERFECT STORM and WAR comes a book about why men miss war, why Londoners missed the Blitz, and what we can all learn from American Indian captives who refused to go home.    </p>
<p>                              Tribe is a look at post-traumatic stress disorder and the challenges veterans face returning to society. Using his background in anthropology, Sebastian Junger argues that the problem lies not with vets or with the trauma they&#8217;ve suffered, but with the society to which they are trying to return.    </p>
<p>                              One of the most puzzling things about veterans who experience PTSD is that the majority never even saw combat-and yet they feel deeply alienated and out of place back home. The reason may lie in our natural inclination, as a species, to live in groups of thirty to fifty people who are entirely reliant on one another for safety, comfort and a sense of meaning: in short, the life of a soldier.    </p>
<p>                              It is one of the ironies of the modern age that as affluence rises in a society, so do rates of suicide, depression and of course PTSD. In a wealthy society people don&#8217;t need to cooperate with one another, so they often lead much lonelier lives that lead to psychological distress. There is a way for modern society to reverse this trend, however, and studying how veterans react to coming home may provide a clue to how to do it. But it won&#8217;t be easy.</p>
