										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestseller about two guys who went out for coffee and dreamed up Seinfeld-&#8220;A wildly entertaining must-read not only for Seinfeld fans but for anyone who wants a better understanding of how television series are made&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).    </p>
<p>                    Comedians Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld never thought anyone would watch their sitcom about a New York comedian sitting around talking to his friends. But against all odds, viewers did watch-first a few and then many, until nine years later nearly forty million Americans were tuning in weekly. Fussy Jerry, neurotic George, eccentric Kramer, and imperious Elaine-people embraced them with love.    </p>
<p>                    Seinfeldia, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong&#8217;s intimate history is full of gossipy details, show trivia, and insights into how famous episodes came to be. Armstrong celebrates the creators and fans of this American television phenomenon, bringing readers into the writers&#8217; room and into a world of devotees for whom it never stopped being relevant. Seinfeld created a strange new reality, one where years after the show had ended the Soup Nazi still spends his days saying &#8220;No soup for you!&#8221;, Joe Davola gets questioned every day about his sanity, and Kenny Kramer makes his living giving tours of New York sites from the show.    </p>
<p>                    Seinfeldia is an outrageous cultural history. Dwight Garner of The New York Times Book Review wrote: &#8220;Armstrong has an eye for detail&#8230;.Perhaps the highest praise I can give Seinfeldia is that it made me want to buy a loaf of marbled rye and start watching again, from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
