<p>                    &#8216;I love @RevRichardColes SO MUCH&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    FATHOMLESS RICHES is the Reverend Richard Coles&#8217;s warm, witty and wise memoir in which he divulges with searing honesty and intimacy his pilgrimage from a rock-and-roll life of sex and drugs in the Communards to one devoted to God and Christianity. The result is one of the most unusual and readable life stories of recent times, and has the power to shock as well as to console.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The award-winning New York Times bestseller that inspired BTS&#8217;s K-pop song &#8216;Magic Shop&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    The day that 12-year-old James Doty walked in to his local magic shop is the day that changed his life.     </p>
<p>                    Once the neglected son of an alcoholic father and a mother with chronic depression, he has gone on to become a leading neurosurgeon, based at Stanford University. He credits Ruth for this incredible turnaround: the remarkable woman he met at the Cactus Rabbit Magic Shop, who devoted the summer to transforming his mind and opening his heart.    </p>
<p>                    In this uplifting memoir, Jim explains the visualisation techniques Ruth taught him that gave him the self-esteem to imagine a new future for himself. He examines the science behind mindfulness and why the skills he learned &#8211; of focus and attention &#8211; now help him to think fast and keep calm in the operating theatre. And he shows us what is possible when you start to change your brain and your heart. Into the Magic Shop imparts some powerful life lessons about how to live better, and inspires us to believe that we all have inside us the capacity to change our own destiny.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I&#8217;m sure many readers will be moved by this inspiring story to open their hearts and see what they too can do for others&#8217; &#8211; His Holiness the Dalai Lama</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A religious fundamentalist, a political operative, a primitive sermonizer, and an accomplice of worldly secular powers. Her mission has always been of this kind. The irony is that she has never been able to induce anybody to believe her. It is past time that she was duly honored and taken at her word.     </p>
<p>                     Among his many books, perhaps none have sparked more outrage than The Missionary Position, Christopher Hitchens&#8217;s meticulous study of the life and deeds of Mother Teresa.     </p>
<p>                     A Nobel Peace Prize recipient beatified by the Catholic Church in 2003, Mother Teresa of Calcutta was celebrated by heads of state and adored by millions for her work on behalf of the poor. In his measured critique, Hitchens asks only that Mother Teresa&#8217;s reputation be judged by her actions-not the other way around.     </p>
<p>                     With characteristic élan and rhetorical dexterity, Hitchens eviscerates the fawning cult of Teresa, recasting the Albanian missionary as a spurious, despotic, and megalomaniacal operative of the wealthy who long opposed measures to end poverty, and fraternized, for financial gain, with tyrants and white-collar criminals throughout the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestseller    </p>
<p>                    One of PW&#8217;s Best Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                    One of Amazon&#8217;s Best Books of the Month     </p>
<p>                    Why is religion still around in the twenty-first century? Why do so many still believe? And how do various traditions still shape the way people experience everything from sexuality to politics, whether they are religious or not? In Why Religion? Elaine Pagels looks to her own life to help address these questions.    </p>
<p>                    These questions took on a new urgency for Pagels when dealing with unimaginable loss&#8211;the death of her young son, followed a year later by the shocking loss of her husband. Here she interweaves a personal story with the work that she loves, illuminating how, for better and worse, religious traditions have shaped how we understand ourselves; how we relate to one another; and, most importantly, how to get through the most difficult challenges we face.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing upon the perspectives of neurologists, anthropologists, and historians, as well as her own research, Pagels opens unexpected ways of understanding persistent religious aspects of our culture.     </p>
<p>                    A provocative and deeply moving account from one of the most compelling religious thinkers at work today, Why Religion? explores the spiritual dimension of human experience.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The extraordinary life of the man who founded Islam, and the world he inhabited&#8211;and remade.     </p>
<p>                    Lesley Hazleton&#8217;s new book, Agnostic: A Spirited Manifesto, is out now from Riverhead Books.     </p>
<p>                     Muhammad&#8217;s was a life of almost unparalleled historical importance; yet for all the iconic power of his name, the intensely dramatic story of the prophet of Islam is not well known. In The First Muslim, Lesley Hazleton brings him vibrantly to life. Drawing on early eyewitness sources and on history, politics, religion, and psychology, she renders him as a man in full, in all his complexity and vitality.     </p>
<p>                     Hazleton&#8217;s account follows the arc of Muhammad&#8217;s rise from powerlessness to power, from anonymity to renown, from insignificance to lasting significance. How did a child shunted to the margins end up revolutionizing his world? How did a merchant come to challenge the established order with a new vision of social justice? How did the pariah hounded out of Mecca turn exile into a new and victorious beginning? How did the outsider become the ultimate insider?     </p>
<p>                     Impeccably researched and thrillingly readable, Hazleton&#8217;s narrative creates vivid insight into a man navigating between idealism and pragmatism, faith and politics, nonviolence and violence, rejection and acclaim. The First Muslim illuminates not only an immensely significant figure but his lastingly relevant legacy.</p>
