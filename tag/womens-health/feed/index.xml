										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Does eating sugar cause yeast infections? Does pubic hair have a function?<br />
                    Should you have a vulvovaginal care regimen?<br />
                    Will your vagina shrivel up if you go without sex?<br />

<p>                    So many important questions, so much convincing, confusing, contradictory misinformation! In this age of click bait, pseudoscience, and celebrity-endorsed products, it&#8217;s easy to be overwhelmed-whether it&#8217;s websites, advice from well-meaning friends, uneducated partners, and even healthcare providers. So how do you separate facts from fiction? Obstetrician Jen Gunter, an expert on women&#8217;s health-and the internet&#8217;s most popular go-to doc-comes to the rescue with a book that debunks the myths and educates and empowers women. From reproductive health to the impact of antibiotics and probiotics, and the latest trends, including vaginal steaming, vaginal marijuana products, and jade eggs, Gunter takes us on a factual, fun-filled journey.     </p>
<p>                    Discover the truth about:    </p>

                    *         Cosmetic vaginal surgery<br />
                    *         What changes to expect during pregnancy, after childbirth, and through menopause<br />
                    *         How medicine fails women by dismissing symptoms    </p>
<p>                    Plus:<br />
                    *         Thongs vs. lace: the best underwear for vaginal health<br />
                    *         How to select a tampon<br />
                    *         The full glory of the clitoris and the myth of the G Spot    </p>
<p>                    &#8230; And so much more. Whether you&#8217;re a twenty-six-year-old worried that her labia are &#8216;uncool&#8217; or a sixty-six-year-old dealing with painful sex, this comprehensive guide is sure to become a lifelong trusted resource.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hill&#8217;s advice is straightforward and no-nonsense&#8217; &#8211; The Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A life-transforming book&#8230; fascinating &#8211; Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Maisie Hill has written a bloody brilliant book (pun intended). Everything you need to know about periods and how they affect you and your life is here. It&#8217;s revolutionary&#8217; &#8211; Miranda Sawyer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thank GOODNESS for Maisie Hill! Flipping open the lid on a vital conversation. It&#8217;s about time we claimed the power of our periods!&#8217; &#8211; Gemma Cairney, broadcaster &#038; co-founder of Boom Shakalaka Productions    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is such an important book. Maisie&#8217;s insights and cycle strategy have changed my life and my cycle. Period Power is written with such intelligence, humour and a deep understanding of women&#8217;s health. If you have a period you need to read this book.&#8217; &#8211; Anna Jones, author of The Modern Cook&#8217;s Year    </p>
<p>                    A profound and practical blueprint for aligning daily life with your menstrual cycle.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is the handbook to periods and hormones that will leave you wondering why the hell nobody told you this sooner.    </p>
<p>                    The hormones of the menstrual cycle profoundly influence our energy, mood and behaviour, but all too often we&#8217;re taught that our hormones make us unreliable, moody bitches, or that it&#8217;s our lot in life to put up with &#8216;women&#8217;s problems&#8217;. Maisie Hill, a women&#8217;s health practitioner, knows the power of working with the menstrual cycle and refuses to accept this theory. Instead, Maisie believes that our hormones are there to serve us and, if utilized correctly, can be used to help you get what you want out of life. Yes, we are hormonal, and that&#8217;s a very good thing.    </p>
<p>                    This revolutionary book reveals everything you need to know about taking control of your menstrual cycle and outlines The Cycle Strategy to help us perform at our best, throughout our cycle. In Period Power you will discover how to:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; maximise your natural superpowers each month while making adjustments for the darker days, and use Maisie&#8217;s favourite tips to improve them<br />
                    &#8211; identify your personal patterns, powers and pitfalls for each phase of the menstrual cycle<br />
                    &#8211; plan your month to perform at your best in all aspects of your life<br />
                    &#8211; figure out if you have a hormonal imbalance and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is a no-nonsense guide with all the tools you need to improve your menstrual health.</p>

<p>                    The instant New York Times bestseller from the author of Reviving Ophelia&#8211;a guide to wisdom, authenticity, and bliss for women as they age.     </p>
<p>                    Women growing older contend with ageism, misogyny, and loss. Yet as Mary Pipher shows, most older women are deeply happy and filled with gratitude for the gifts of life. Their struggles help them grow into the authentic, empathetic, and wise people they have always wanted to be.     </p>
<p>                    In Women Rowing North, Pipher offers a timely examination of the cultural and developmental issues women face as they age. Drawing on her own experience as daughter, sister, mother, grandmother, caregiver, clinical psychologist, and cultural anthropologist, she explores ways women can cultivate resilient responses to the challenges they face. &#8220;If we can keep our wits about us, think clearly, and manage our emotions skillfully,&#8221; Pipher writes, &#8220;we will experience a joyous time of our lives. If we have planned carefully and packed properly, if we have good maps and guides, the journey can be transcendent.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shocking, heartfelt and well-researched&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A ground-shaping book that defines the edge of so many vital contemporary debates. Hers is a voice simultaneously behind and beyond the veil&#8217; Colum McCann    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating, can&#8217;t-look-away, whistle-stop tour of the Middle East&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brave and impassioned . . . A shocking book, and one that will make anyone who has seen veiling as a cultural issue think very hard about what is really going on&#8217; Mail on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens explodes the myth that we should stand back and watch while women are disempowered and abused in the name of religion.    </p>
<p>                     In this laceratingly honest account, Eltahawy takes aim both at attitudes in the Middle East and at the western liberals who mistake misogyny for cultural difference. Her argument is clear: unless political revolution in the Arab world is accompanied by social and sexual revolution, no progress will be made.    </p>
<p>                    Headscarves and Hymens is the book the world has been crying out for: a powerful, fearless account of what it really means to be a woman in the Muslim world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I ate and ate and ate in the hopes that if I made myself big, my body would be safe. I buried the girl I was because she ran into all kinds of trouble. I tried to erase every memory of her, but she is still there, somewhere. . . . I was trapped in my body, one that I barely recognized or understood, but at least I was safe.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    New York Times bestselling author Roxane Gay has written with intimacy and sensitivity about food and bodies, using her own emotional and psychological struggles as a means of exploring our shared anxieties over pleasure, consumption, appearance, and health. As a woman who describes her own body as &#8220;wildly undisciplined,&#8221; Roxane understands the tension between desire and denial, between self-comfort and self-care. In Hunger, she casts an insightful and critical eye on her childhood, teens, and twenties-including the devastating act of violence that acted as a turning point in her young life-and brings readers into the present and the realities, pains, and joys of her daily life.    </p>
<p>                    With the bracing candor, vulnerability, and authority that have made her one of the most admired voices of her generation, Roxane explores what it means to be overweight in a time when the bigger you are, the less you are seen. Hunger is a deeply personal memoir from one of our finest writers, and tells a story that hasn&#8217;t yet been told but needs to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;This book is a gift! I&#8217;ve been practicing their strategies, and it&#8217;s a total game-changer.&#8221;&#8211;Brené Brown, PhD, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Dare to Lead     </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking book explains why women experience burnout differently than men&#8211;and provides a simple, science-based plan to help women minimize stress, manage emotions, and live a more joyful life.    </p>
<p>                     Burnout. Many women in America have experienced it. What&#8217;s expected of women and what it&#8217;s really like to be a woman in today&#8217;s world are two very different things&#8211;and women exhaust themselves trying to close the gap between them. How can you &#8220;love your body&#8221; when every magazine cover has ten diet tips for becoming &#8220;your best self&#8221;? How do you &#8220;lean in&#8221; at work when you&#8217;re already operating at 110 percent and aren&#8217;t recognized for it? How can you live happily and healthily in a sexist world that is constantly telling you you&#8217;re too fat, too needy, too noisy, and too selfish?     </p>
<p>                     Sisters Emily Nagoski, PhD, and Amelia Nagoski, DMA, are here to help end the cycle of feeling overwhelmed and exhausted. Instead of asking us to ignore the very real obstacles and societal pressures that stand between women and well-being, they explain with compassion and optimism what we&#8217;re up against&#8211;and show us how to fight back. In these pages you&#8217;ll learn     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; what you can do to complete the biological stress cycle&#8211;and return your body to a state of relaxation<br />
                     &#8211; how to manage the &#8220;monitor&#8221; in your brain that regulates the emotion of frustration<br />
                     &#8211; how the Bikini Industrial Complex makes it difficult for women to love their bodies&#8211;and how to defend yourself against it<br />
                     &#8211; why rest, human connection, and befriending your inner critic are keys to recovering and preventing burnout     </p>
<p>                     With the help of eye-opening science, prescriptive advice, and helpful worksheets and exercises, all women will find something transformative in these pages&#8211;and will be empowered to create positive change. Emily and Amelia aren&#8217;t here to preach the broad platitudes of expensive self-care or insist that we strive for the impossible goal of &#8220;having it all.&#8221; Instead, they tell us that we are enough, just as we are&#8211;and that wellness, true wellness, is within our reach.     </p>
<p>                    NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY BOOKRIOT     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Burnout is the gold standard of self-help books, delivering cutting-edge science with energy, empathy, and wit. The authors know exactly what&#8217;s going on inside your frazzled brain and body, and exactly what you can do to fix it. . . .

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Based on her inspiring, viral 2018 commencement speech to Barnard College&#8217;s graduates in New York City, New York Times bestselling author, two-time Olympic gold medallist and FIFA World Cup champion Abby Wambach delivers her empowering rally cry for women to unleash their individual power, unite with their pack, and emerge victorious together.    </p>
<p>                    Abby Wambach became a champion because of her incredible talent as a football player. She became an icon because of her remarkable wisdom as a leader. As the co-captain of the 2015 Women&#8217;s World Cup Champion Team, she created a culture not just of excellence, but of honour, commitment, resilience, and sisterhood. She helped transform a group of individual women into one of the most successful, powerful and united Wolfpacks of all time.    </p>
<p>                    In her retirement, Abby&#8217;s ready to do the same for her new team: All Women Everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    She insists that women must let go of old rules of leadership that neither include or serve them. She&#8217;s created a new set of Wolfpack rules to help women unleash their individual power, unite with their Wolfpack, and change the landscape of their lives and world.    </p>
<p>                    * Make failure your fuel: Transform failure to wisdom and power.<br />
                    * Lead from the bench: Lead from wherever you are.<br />
                    * Champion each other: Claim each woman&#8217;s victory as your own.<br />
                    * Demand the effing ball: Don&#8217;t ask permission: take what you&#8217;ve earned.    </p>
<p>                    In Abby&#8217;s vision, we are not Little Red Riding Hoods, staying on the path because we&#8217;re told to. We are the wolves, fighting for a better tomorrow for ourselves, our pack, and all the future wolves who will come after us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revised and updated edition of Emily Nagoski&#8217;s game-changing New York Times bestseller Come As You Are, featuring new information and research on mindfulness, desire, and pleasure that will radically transform your sex life.     </p>
<p>                    For much of the 20th and 21st centuries, women&#8217;s sexuality was an uncharted territory in science, studied far less frequently&#8211;and far less seriously&#8211;than its male counterpart.     </p>
<p>                    That is, until Emily Nagoski&#8217;s Come As You Are, which used groundbreaking science and research to prove that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they&#8217;re organized but how you feel about them. In the years since the book&#8217;s initial publication, countless women have learned through Nagoski&#8217;s accessible and informative guide that things like stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman&#8217;s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it&#8211;and that even if you don&#8217;t always feel like it, you are already sexually whole by just being yourself. This revised and updated edition continues that mission with new information and advanced research, demystifying and decoding the science of sex so that everyone can create a better sex life and discover more pleasure than you ever thought possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Become a mama without the drama    </p>
<p>                     When you&#8217;re pregnant, your friends, the Internet, and even your doctor often give advice that leaves you anxious and overwhelmed. You deserve a calm, straightforward, no-nonsense pregnancy. It&#8217;s time to dial down the stress and dial up the common sense. Common Sense Pregnancy is a breath of fresh air: accessible, authoritative, funny, reassuring, and personable, while still chock-full of comprehensive, medically-sound advice. Women&#8217;s health expert, labor nurse, mother of four, and Fit Pregnancy.com columnist Jeanne Faulkner has been at the bedside for thousands of deliveries and provides the honest insider advice you need during pregnancy, labor, birth, and beyond, including straight talk on:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Which prenatal tests you actually need, and which you don&#8217;t.<br />
                     &#8211; Who&#8217;s on your labor team&#8211;and how to keep your labor room drama free.<br />
                     &#8211; What about sex?<br />
                     &#8211; How to deal with feeling lousy.<br />
                     &#8211; What works and what doesn&#8217;t for starting labor naturally.<br />
                     &#8211; How to avoid unneces­sary and risky medical interventions.     </p>
<p>                     Whether you want your pregnancy and birth to be all natural, all medical, or something in between, Common Sense Pregnancy eliminates the fear and puts you in charge of your body and prenatal experience, and helps you make the right choices for you and your baby.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Seen/Heard in Bustle * Dan Savage&#8217;s Savage Lovecast * Jezebel * Women&#8217;s Health * Prevention * The New York Times * VICE * Pleasure Mechanics    </p>
<p>                    A groundbreaking method for improving desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction through mindfulness.     </p>
<p>                    Studies show that approximately half of all women experience some kind of sexual difficulty at one point in their lives, with lack of interest in sex being by far the most common and the most distressing. And when sex suffers, so do all other areas of life.    </p>
<p>                    But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. In Better Sex through Mindfulness, acclaimed psychologist and sex researcher Lori A. Brotto offers a revolutionary approach to improving desire, arousal, and satisfaction inside and outside of the bedroom. A pioneer in the use of mindfulness for treating sexual difficulties, Brotto has helped hundreds of women cultivate more exciting, fulfilling sexual experiences.    </p>
<p>                    In this accessible, relatable book, she explores the various reasons for sexual problems, such as stress and incessant multitasking, and tells the stories of many of the women she has treated over the years. She also provides easy, effective exercises that readers can do on their own to increase desire and sexual enjoyment, whether their goal is to overcome a sexual difficulty or simply give their love life a boost.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER &#8211; OVER 1.5 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A deeply compassionate guide to self-care &#8211; simple and profound&#8217; Sir Kenneth Branagh    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you want to free yourself from anxiety and stress, and feel truly at ease with yourself, then read this book&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Authoritative, beautifully written and much-loved by its readers, Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world has become a word-of-mouth bestseller and global phenomenon. It reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that you can incorporate into daily life to break the cycle of anxiety, stress unhappiness and exhaustion. It promotes the kind of happiness that gets into your bones and allows you to meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.     </p>
<p>                    Mindfulness is based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Co-developed by Professor Mark Williams of Oxford University, MBCT is recommended by the UK&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is as effective as drugs for preventing depression. But, equally, it works for the rest of us who aren&#8217;t depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the relentless demands of the modern world.     </p>
<p>                    By investing just a few minutes each day, this classic guide to mindfulness will put you back in control of your life once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the fall of 2010, Abby Norman&#8217;s strong dancer&#8217;s body dropped forty pounds and gray hairs began to sprout from her temples. She was repeatedly hospitalized in excruciating pain, but the doctors insisted it was a urinary tract infection and sent her home with antibiotics. Unable to get out of bed, much less attend class, Norman dropped out of college and embarked on what would become a years-long journey to discover what was wrong with her. It wasn&#8217;t until she took matters into her own hands&#8211;securing a job in a hospital and educating herself over lunchtime reading in the medical library&#8211;that she found an accurate diagnosis of endometriosis.    </p>
<p>                    In Ask Me About My Uterus, Norman describes what it was like to have her pain dismissed, to be told it was all in her head, only to be taken seriously when she was accompanied by a boyfriend who confirmed that her sexual performance was, indeed, compromised. Putting her own trials into a broader historical, sociocultural, and political context, Norman shows that women&#8217;s bodies have long been the battleground of a never-ending war for power, control, medical knowledge, and truth. It&#8217;s time to refute the belief that being a woman is a preexisting condition.</p>
