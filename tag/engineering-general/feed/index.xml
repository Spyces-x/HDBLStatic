										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why don&#8217;t we have a lunar colony already? In this witty and entertaining book, Kelly and Zach Weinersmith give us a snapshot of the transformative technologies that are coming next &#8211; from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters &#8211; and explain how they will change our world in astonishing ways. By weaving together their own research, interviews with pioneering scientists and Zach&#8217;s trademark comics, the Weinersmiths investigate why these innovations are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Elegant prose and excellent reporting . . . By the time I had finished reading, I had underlined many intriguing ideas.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;No doubt Inventology will be marketed to the creative business class, but there&#8217;s ample interest here even for readers who aren&#8217;t actively inventing anything.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Globe     </p>
<p>                     A doctor realizes that an innocent-looking tube is killing his patients, then reads a newspaper article that inspires him to create a better version that serves as an early warning system for infections. A father cleans up after his toddler and builds a &#8220;sippy&#8221; cup that won&#8217;t spill. An engineer dreams of a different world and pioneers the cell phone.     </p>
<p>                     By studying breakthroughs like these, we can learn how people imagine their way around &#8220;impossible&#8221; problems to discover groundbreaking answers. Pagan Kennedy reports on how enduring methods of invention can be adapted to the twenty-first century, as millions of us deploy tools like crowdfunding, big data, and 3-D printing to address our needs or realize our dreams. Drawing on fresh research and the surprising stories behind many inventions old and new to reveal the steps that most reliably produce discovery, Inventology is a myth-shattering book and a must-read for anyone who is curious about creativity and the mental leaps required to solve our most challenging problems.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;&#8216;Inventology&#8217; may be a real science; researchers are beginning to study it, and teachers are teaching it . . . A delightful account of how inventors do what they do.&#8221;&#8211;Kirkus Reviews, starred review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Offers a new perspective into the process of invention that will inform and illuminate.&#8221;&#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How do today&#8217;s most successful tech companies-Amazon, Google, Facebook, Netflix, Tesla-design, develop, and deploy the products that have earned the love of literally billions of people around the world?    </p>
<p>                     Perhaps surprisingly, they do it very differently than most tech companies.    </p>
<p>                     In INSPIRED, technology product management thought leader Marty Cagan provides readers with a master class in how to structure and staff a vibrant and successful product organization, and how to discover and deliver technology products that your customers will love-and that will work for your business.    </p>
<p>                     With sections on assembling the right people and skillsets, discovering the right product, embracing an effective yet lightweight process, and creating a strong product culture, readers can take the information they learn and immediately leverage it within their own organizations-dramatically improving their own product efforts.    </p>
<p>                     Whether you&#8217;re an early stage startup working to get to product/market fit, or a growth-stage company working to scale your product organization, or a large, long-established company trying to regain your ability to consistently deliver new value for your customers, INSPIRED will take you and your product organization to a new level of customer engagement, consistent innovation, and business success.    </p>
<p>                     Filled with the author&#8217;s own personal stories-and profiles of some of today&#8217;s most-successful product managers and technology-powered product companies, including Adobe, Apple, BBC, Google, Microsoft, and Netflix-INSPIRED will show you how to turn up the dial of your own product efforts, creating technology products your customers love.    </p>
<p>                     The first edition of INSPIRED, published ten years ago, established itself as the primary reference for technology product managers, and can be found on the shelves of nearly every successful technology product company worldwide. This thoroughly updated second edition shares the same objective of being the most valuable resource for technology product managers, yet it is completely new-sharing the latest practices and techniques of today&#8217;s most-successful tech product companies, and the men and women behind every great product.</p>
