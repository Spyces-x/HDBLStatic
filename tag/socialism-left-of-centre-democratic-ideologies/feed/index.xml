										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instant New York Times bestseller<br />
                     &#8220;Howard Zinn on acid or some bullsh*t like that.&#8221; -Tim Heidecker</p>
<p>                     The creators of the cult-hit podcast Chapo Trap House deliver a manifesto for everyone who feels orphaned and alienated-politically, culturally, and economically-by the lanyard-wearing Wall Street centrism of the left and the lizard-brained atavism of the right: there is a better way, the Chapo Way.</p>
<p>                    In a guide that reads like &#8220;a weirder, smarter, and deliciously meaner version of The Daily Show&#8217;s 2004 America (The Book)&#8221; (Paste), Chapo Trap House shows you that you don&#8217;t have to side with either sinking ships. These self-described &#8220;assholes from the internet&#8221; offer a fully ironic ideology for all who feel politically hopeless and prefer broadsides and tirades to reasoned debate.</p>
<p>                     Learn the &#8220;secret&#8221; history of the world, politics, media, and everything in-between that THEY don&#8217;t want you to know and chart a course from our wretched present to a utopian future where one can post in the morning, game in the afternoon, and podcast after dinner without ever becoming a poster, gamer, or podcaster.</p>
<p>                     A book that&#8217;s &#8220;as intellectually serious and analytically original as it is irreverent and funny&#8221; (Glenn Greenwald, New York Times bestselling author of No Place to Hide) The Chapo Guide to Revolution features illustrated taxonomies of contemporary liberal and conservative characters, biographies of important thought leaders, &#8220;never before seen&#8221; drafts of Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s Newsroom manga, and the ten new laws that govern Chapo Year Zero (everyone gets a dog, billionaires are turned into Soylent, and logic is outlawed). If you&#8217;re a fan of sacred cows, prisoners being taken, and holds being barred, then this book is NOT for you. However, if you feel disenfranchised from the political and cultural nightmare we&#8217;re in, then Chapo, let&#8217;s go&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Powerful and poetic &#8230; For anyone interested in the myth of Che Guevara &#8230; this book is essential reading&#8217; Colm Toibin, Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;We were an army of shadows, of ghosts, walking as if to the beat of some dark psychic mechanism&#8230;&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The Cuban Revolution changed the course of the twentieth century. Following years of brutal tyranny and poverty, a band of idealistic young people fought against immense odds to overthrow a dictator and emerged victorious. This is the story of how they did it. Che Guevara&#8217;s classic eyewitness account chronicles the transformation of a country, and of Che himself, from troop doctor to revolutionary icon.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Che&#8217;s life is an inspiration for every human being who loves freedom&#8217; Nelson Mandela    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stalin&#8217;s gulag, impoverished North Korea, collapsing Cuba&#8230;it&#8217;s hard to name a dogma that has failed as spectacularly as socialism. And yet leaders around the world continue to subject millions of people to this dysfunctional, violence-prone ideology. </p>
<p>                    In The Politically Incorrect Guide(TM) to Socialism, Kevin Williamson reveals the fatal flaw of socialism&#8211;that efficient, complex economies simply can&#8217;t be centrally planned. But even in America, that hasn&#8217;t stopped politicians and bureaucrats from planning, to various extents, the most vital sectors of our economy: public education, energy, and the most arrogant central-planning effort of them all, Obama&#8217;s healthcare plan. </p>
<p>                    In this provocative book, Williamson unfolds the grim history of socialism, showing how the ideology has spawned crushing poverty, devastating famines, and horrific wars. Lumbering from one crisis to the next, leaving a trail of economic devastation and environmental catastrophe, socialism has wreaked more havoc, caused more deaths, and impoverished more people than any other ideology in history&#8211;especially when you include the victims of fascism, which Williamson notes is simply a variant of socialism. </p>
<p>                    Williamson further demonstrates: </p>
<p>                    Why, contrary to popular belief, socialism in theory is no better than socialism in practice<br />
                    Why socialism can&#8217;t exist without capitalism<br />
                    How the energy powerhouse of Venezuela, under socialism, has become an economic basket case subject to rationing and blackouts<br />
                    How socialism, not British colonialism, plunged the bountiful economy of India into stagnation and dysfunction&#8211;and how capitalism is rescuing it<br />
                    Why socialism is inextricably linked to communism </p>
<p>                    If you thought socialism went into the dustbin of history with the collapse of the Soviet Union, think again. Socialism is alive and kicking, and it&#8217;s already spread further than you know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Origins of Political Order, Francis Fukuyama took us from the dawn of mankind to the French and American Revolutions.  Here, he picks up the thread again in the second instalment of his definitive account of mankind&#8217;s emergence as a political animal.    </p>
<p>                    This is the story of how state, law and democracy developed after these cataclysmic events, how the modern landscape &#8211; with its uneasy tension between dictatorships and liberal democracies &#8211; evolved and how in the United States and in other developed democracies, unmistakable signs of decay have emerged.     </p>
<p>                    If we want to understand the political systems that dominate and order our lives, we must first address their origins &#8211; in our own recent past as well as in the earliest systems of human government. Fukuyama argues that the key to successful government can be reduced to three key elements: a strong state, the rule of law and institutions of democratic accountability.    </p>
<p>                    This magisterial account is required reading for anyone wishing to know more about mankind&#8217;s greatest achievements.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people of the Congo have suffered from a particularly brutal colonial rule, American interference after independence, decades of robbery at the hands of the dictator Mobutu and periodic warfare which continues even now in the East of the country. But, as this insightful political history makes clear, the Congolese people have not taken these multiple oppressions lying down and have fought over many years to establish democratic institutions at home and free themselves from foreign exploitation; indeed these are two aspects of a single project.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Nzongola-Ntalaja is one of his country&#8217;s leading intellectuals and his panoramic understanding of the personalities and events, as well as class, ethnic and other factors, make his book a lucid, radical and utterly unromanticized account of his countrymen&#8217;s struggle. His people&#8217;s defeat and the state&#8217;s post-colonial crisis are seen as resulting from a post-independence collapse of the anti-colonial alliance between the masses and the national leadership .    </p>
<p>                    This book is essential reading for understanding what is happening in the Congo and the Great Lakes region under the rule of the late President Kabila, and now his son. It will also stand as a milestone in how to write the modern political history of Africa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is socialism? Does it have a future, or has it become an outdated ideology in the 21st century?    </p>
<p>                    This Very Short Introduction considers the major theories in socialism, and explores its historical evolution from the French Revolution to the present day. Michael Newman argues that socialism has always been a diverse doctrine, while nevertheless containing a central core of interconnected values and goals: a critique of capitalism; an optimistic view of human beings; and the belief that it is possible to establish societies based on egalitarianism, social solidarity, and<br />
                    co-operation. In this new edition, he draws on case studies such as Cuba, Sweden, and Bolivia, to consider attempts to implement socialism in practice, before discussing New Left challenges to conventional notions of socialism on such questions as feminism, climate change, and direct action. Rejecting the widespread<br />
