										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally! The book that helps you deal with irrational, impossible people. &#8211; Oprah&#8217;s Book Club 2.0 Let&#8217;s face it: we all know people who are downright irrational. No matter how hard you try to reason with them, it never works. So what&#8217;s the solution? How do you talk to someone who just won&#8217;t listen? What can you do with an unrealistic boss, an angry spouse, or an overly emotional friend? You can&#8217;t win by ignoring the insanity-and you can&#8217;t argue it away. But you can stop it cold. Top-ranked psychiatrist and communication expert Mark Goulston shows you how in Talking to Crazy, a life-changing book for everyone trapped in maddening personal or professional relationships. Goulston unlocks the mysteries of the irrational mind, and explains how faulty thinking patterns develop. His keen insights are matched by a set of counterintuitive strategies proven to defuse crazy behavior, along with scripts, examples, and exercises that teach you how to use them. You&#8217;ll learn: Why people act the way they do * How instinctive responses can exacerbate the situation-and what to do instead * When to confront a problem and when to walk away * How to activate the Sanity Cycle-which quickly transforms you from threat to ally * How to use 14 simple, but effective communication techniques, including assertive submission flattery, the kiss-off, and more * And much more You can&#8217;t reason with unreasonable people-but you can reach them. This powerful and practical book shows you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This original and lucid account of the complexities of love and its essential role in human well-being draws on the latest scientific research. Three eminent psychiatrists tackle the difficult task of reconciling what artists and thinkers have known for thousands of years about the human heart with what has only recently been learned about the primitive functions of the human brain.    </p>
<p>                    A General Theory of Love demonstrates that our nervous systems are not self-contained: from earliest childhood, our brains actually link with those of the people close to us, in a silent rhythm that alters the very structure of our brains, establishes life-long emotional patterns, and makes us, in large part, who we are. Explaining how relationships function, how parents shape their child&#8217;s developing self, how psychotherapy really works, and how our society dangerously flouts essential emotional laws, this is a work of rare passion and eloquence that will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents are facing the toughest challenge of their lives. They want to create a loving family environment filled with mutual respect and cooperation&#8230; but they find instead that human nature and the influence of our culture combine to produce an atmosphere of anxiety, exhaustion, and far too much screaming. Perhaps you can relate!     </p>
<p>                    Whether you scream at your children or not, you no doubt feel anxious about them and their choices. You worry how they&#8217;ll turn out. Unfortunately for parents, many of the techniques some experts present only seem to make matters worse. Hal Edward Runkel has discovered why: Parents are spending far too much time orbiting their lives around their children. They need to return the focus to themselves. They need to grow up and calm down.     </p>
<p>                    ScreamFree Parenting is about taming your reactive responses to your deep anxiety. Rather than learning new techniques, you&#8217;ll discover the liberating principles, based on scriptural truths, that are inspiring parents just like you to revolutionize their family life. Principles that will enable you to remain cool, calm, and connected with your children, no matter what.     </p>
<p>                    Learn how to parent less out of your deepest fears and more out of the highest principles in ScreamFree Parenting.     </p>
<p>                    Special edition distributed through Christian booksellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Astro Teller currently oversees Google[x] and Danielle Teller is a physician specializing in the fields of intensive care and lung medicine. Together, they bring a fresh and startling perspective on marriage and divorce in SACRED COWS.    </p>
<p>                     Drs. Astro and Danielle Teller know better than most that finding the right partner in life doesn&#8217;t always happen the first time around. Through their own divorces they learned how widely held cultural assumptions and misinformation that nobody thinks to question-what they refer to as &#8220;sacred cows&#8221;-create unnecessary heartache for people who are already suffering through a terrible time.    </p>
<p>                     Do you think, for example, that the divorce rate in the United States is rising? Or that children are harmed by divorce? Most people do, but it turns out that neither of these notions is supported by the data. Combining the rigor that has established them as leaders in their respective fields along with a dose of good-natured humor, the Tellers ask readers to take a fresh look at seven common sacred cows: the Holy Cow, the Expert Cow, the Selfish Cow, the Defective Cow, the Innocent Victim Cow, the One True Cow, and the Other Cow. This is not a book that is &#8220;for&#8221; marriage or &#8220;for&#8221; divorce, but &#8220;for&#8221; the freedom to decide how to live most honestly and happily either as part of a couple or a single person.    </p>
<p>                     In the same way that Esther Perel&#8217;s bestselling MATING IN CAPTIVITY gave couples a fresh perspective on their married life, so SACRED COWS invites readers to question assumptions and conventional wisdom. It offers a smart, insightful, and sympathetic view for those in a marital crisis, marriage counsellors, or anyone looking to gain a fresh perspective on one of our most cherished and misunderstood institutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the most important books of our modern era&#8221; -Amb. Jaime de Bourbon    </p>
<p>                    For anyone struggling with conflict, this book can transform you. Negotiating the Nonnegotiable takes you on a journey into the heart and soul of conflict, providing unique insight into the emotional undercurrents that too often sweep us out to sea. With vivid stories of his closed-door sessions with warring political groups, disputing businesspeople, and families in crisis, Daniel Shapiro presents a universally applicable method to successfully navigate conflict.  A deep, provocative book to reflect on and wrestle with, this book can change your life.    </p>
<p>                     Be warned: This book is not a quick fix. Real change takes work. You will learn how to master five emotional dynamics that can sabotage conflict outside your awareness:    </p>
<p>                    1. Vertigo: How can you avoid      getting emotionally consumed in conflict?<br />
                    2. Repetition compulsion: How can you stop      repeating the same conflicts again and again?<br />
                    3. Taboos: How can you discuss      sensitive issues at the heart of the conflict?<br />
                    4. Assault on the sacred: What should you do if      your values feel threatened?<br />
                    5. Identity politics: What can you do if      others use politics against you?     </p>
<p>                    In our era of discontent, this is just the book we need to resolve conflict in our own lives and in the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1950, only 22% of adults were single. Today, more than 50% of adults are. Though conventional wisdom tells us that living by oneself leads to loneliness and isolation, most solo dwellers, compared with their married counterparts, are more likely to eat out and exercise, sign up for art and music classes, attend public events and lectures, and volunteer. Drawing on over three hundred in-depth interviews with men and women of all ages and every class, Eric Klinenberg reaches some startling conclusions about the seismic impact solo living is having on our culture, business and politics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Vanderkam is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in time management and productivity . . . her insights in Off the Clock can change your life&#8217; &#8211; Dorie Clark, author of Stand Out    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Laura Vanderkam delivers a compelling and evidence-based argument that busyness is overrated in our current culture. Living a full life, at work and at home, is about doing the right things well, and confidently missing out on everything else&#8217; &#8211; Cal Newport, bestselling author of Deep Work    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved it . . . Vanderkam expertly weaves together interviews with experts, anecdotes about her own personal life, philosophical musings, and scientific research&#8217; &#8211; Shana Lebowitz, Business Insider UK    </p>
<p>                    Learn to savour life&#8217;s best moments &#8211; no matter how busy you are &#8211; through mindset shifts that alter your perception of time.    </p>
<p>                    Laura Vanderkam, the acclaimed author of What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast, isn&#8217;t like other time-management gurus. She&#8217;s not trying to shave off 30 seconds here or there; she&#8217;s interested in the emotional and psychological side of the 168 hours everyone has each week. Her message is that we all have more time than we think we do, and can feel less stressed while getting more done.     </p>
<p>                    With the right habits, you can live efficiently and effectively, and yet still see time as abundant. For instance, Vanderkam teaches:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to clear your calendar of activities that are boring, stressful or simply not the best use of your time    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Why tackling your top priorities during the hours when you have the most energy will change your perception of what it means to be productive    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to linger in great experiences while they&#8217;re happening, and why good memories seem to make time expand    </p>
<p>                    Packed with insights from busy yet relaxed professionals, including &#8216;time makeovers&#8217; of people who are learning to use these tools, Off the Clock can inspire the rest of us to creative lives that are not only productive, but enjoyable in the moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From dogs to gods, dive into the science of mysterious minds&#8211;including your own.     </p>
<p>                    Nothing seems more real than the minds of other people. When you consider what your boss is thinking or whether your spouse is happy, you are admitting them into the &#8220;mind club.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to assume other humans can think and feel, but what about a cow, a computer, a corporation? What kinds of minds do they have?     </p>
<p>                    Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray are award-winning psychologists who have discovered that minds&#8211;while incredibly important&#8211;are a matter of perception. Their research opens a trove of new findings, with insights into human behavior that are fascinating, frightening, and funny. The Mind Club explains why we love some animals and eat others, why people debate the existence of God so intensely, how good people can be so cruel, and why robots make such poor lovers. By investigating the mind perception of extraordinary targets&#8211;animals, machines, comatose people, God&#8211;Wegner and Gray explain what it means to have a mind and why it matters so much.     </p>
<p>                    Fusing cutting-edge research and personal anecdotes, The Mind Club explores the moral dimensions of mind perception with wit and compassion, revealing the surprisingly simple basis for what compels us to love and hate, to harm and to protect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk and coauthor of The Grand Design (with Stephen Hawking), a startling and eye-opening examination of how the unconscious mind shapes our experience of the world.     </p>
<p>                     Winner of the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award     </p>
<p>                     Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world&#8211;our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment&#8211;is largely driven by the mind&#8217;s subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events&#8211;along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Common-the Grammy Award, Academy Award, and Golden Globe-winning musician, actor, and activist-follows up his New York Times bestselling memoir One Day It&#8217;ll All Make Sense with this inspiring exploration of how love and mindfulness can build communities and allow you to take better control of your life through actions and words.    </p>
<p>                    Common believes that the phrase &#8220;let love have the last word&#8221; is not just a declaration; it is a statement of purpose, a daily promise. Love is the most powerful force on the planet and ultimately, the way you love determines who you are and how you experience life.    </p>
<p>                    Touching on God, self-love, partners, children, family, and community, Common explores the core tenets of love to help others understand what it means to receive and, most important, to give love. He moves from the personal-writing about his daughter, to whom he wants to be a better father-to the universal, where he observes that our society has become fractured under issues of race and politics. He knows there&#8217;s no quick remedy for all of the hurt in the world, but love-for yourself and for others-is where the healing begins.    </p>
<p>                    Courageous, insightful, brave, and characteristically authentic, Let Love Have the Last Word shares Common&#8217;s own unique and personal stories of the people and experiences that have led to a greater understanding of love and all it has to offer. It is a powerful call to action for a new generation of open hearts and minds, one that is sure to resonate for years to come.</p>

In his revolutionary book, Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard shows that happiness is not just an emotion, but a skill that can be developed. Free of jargon, Happiness contains simple exercises that will train the mind to recognize and pursue happiness by concentrating on the fundamental things in life, and in doing so change the way we view the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International No. 1 Bestseller<br />
                    A BBC 2 Between the Covers Book Club Pick    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Cuts to the heart of who we are&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                    &#8216;A book that begs discussion&#8217; Vanity Fair    </p>
<p>                    All Lina wanted was to be desired. How did she end up in a marriage with two children and a husband who wouldn&#8217;t touch her?    </p>
<p>                    All Maggie wanted was to be understood. How did she end up in a relationship with her teacher and then in court, a hated pariah in her small town?    </p>
<p>                    All Sloane wanted was to be admired. How did she end up a sexual object of men, including her husband, who liked to watch her have sex with other men and women?    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I will probably re-read it every year of my life&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Will have millions nodding in recognition&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As gripping as the most gripping thriller&#8217; Marian Keyes    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;When I picked it up, I felt I&#8217;d been waiting half my life to read it&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The kind of bold, timely, once-in-a-generation book that every house should have a copy of, and probably will before too long&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    The book Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alexa Chung, Jodie Comer, Reese Witherspoon, Harry Styles, Fearne Cotton, Caitriona Balfe, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sharon Horgan, Zoe Ball, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Davina McCall, Gemma Chan, Christine and the Queens and Gillian Anderson are all reading</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most relationship problems are essentially trust issues, explains psychotherapist David Richo. Whether it&#8217;s fear of commitment, insecurity, jealousy, or a tendency to be controlling, the real obstacle is a fundamental lack of trust&#8211;both in ourselves and in our partner.     </p>
<p>                    Daring to Trust offers key insights and practical exercises for exploring and addressing our trust issues in relationships. Topics include     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How we learn early in life to trust others (or not to trust them)<br />
                     &#8211; Why we fear trusting<br />
                    &#8211; Developing greater trust in ourselves as the basis for trusting others<br />
                    &#8211; How to know if someone is trustworthy<br />
                    &#8211; Naive trust vs. healthy, adult trust<br />
                    &#8211; What to do when trust is broken     </p>
<p>                    Ultimately, Richo explains, we must develop trust in four directions: toward ourselves, toward others, toward life as it is, and toward a higher power or spiritual path. These four types of trust are not only the basis of healthy relationships, they are also the foundation of emotional well-being and freedom from fear.</p>

<p>                    In Mating in Captivity, Esther Perel looks at the story of sex in committed couples. Modern romance promises it all &#8211; a lifetime of togetherness, intimacy and erotic desire. In reality, it&#8217;s hard to want what you already have. Our quest for secure love conflicts with our pursuit of passion. And often, the very thing that got us to into our relationships &#8211; lust &#8211; is the one thing that goes missing from them.     </p>
<p>                    Determined to reconcile the erotic and the domestic, Perel explains why democracy is a passion killer in the bedroom. Argues for playfulness, distance, and uncertainty. And shows what it takes to bring lust home. Smart, sexy and explosively original, Mating in Captivity is the monogamist&#8217;s essential bedside read.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than 5 million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are &#8216;wired to connect&#8217; and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect our lives.    </p>
<p>                    Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers, shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies, down to the level of our genes &#8211; for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a &#8216;neural ballet&#8217; that connects us brain-to-brain with those around us.    </p>
<p>                    Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the &#8216;dark side&#8217; of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for &#8216;mindsight&#8217;, as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.    </p>
<p>                    In this book Daniel Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation and altruism &#8211; provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.</p>

<p>                    In today&#8217;s social media and selfie-obsessed culture, we are living in an age of narcissism&#8211;and a society that often celebrates this potentially harmful trait rather than understanding it as a psychological disorder. Scientists are beginning to learn that narcissism exists on a spectrum&#8211;much like autism&#8211;and most of us exhibit some mild narcissistic tendencies. But one in twenty people fall into a category the author refers to as Extreme Narcissism, in which these self-absorbed characteristics result in destructive behavior that harms not only the individual but everyone around them, including friends, family, and coworkers.     </p>
<p>                    With more than thirty years of experience studying personality disorders and treating extreme narcissists, Dr. Joseph Burgo has developed a useful guidebook to help you &#8220;spot narcissists out there in the wild&#8221; (Glamour) and then understand and manage the narcissistic personalities in your own life. Relying on detailed profiles, vignettes from the author&#8217;s practice, and celebrity biographies, The Narcissist You Know offers easy-to-understand tools and solutions you can use to defuse hostile situations and survive assaults on your self-esteem should you ever find yourself in an extreme narcissist&#8217;s orbit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The struggle to understand the infant-parent bond ranks as one of the great quests of modern psychology, one that touches us deeply because it holds so many clues to how we become who we are. How are our personalities formed? How do our early struggles with our parents reappear in the way we relate to others as adults? Why do we repeat with our own children&#8211;seemingly against our will&#8211;the very behaviors we most disliked about our parents? In Becoming Attached, psychologist and noted journalist Robert Karen offers fresh insight into some of the most fundamental and fascinating questions of emotional life.<br />
                     Karen begins by tracing the history of attachment theory through the controversial work of John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst, and Mary Ainsworth, an American developmental psychologist, who together launched a revolution in child psychology. Karen tells about their personal and professional struggles, their groundbreaking discoveries, and the recent flowering of attachment theory research in universities all over the world, making it one of the century&#8217;s most enduring ideas in developmental psychology.<br />
                     In a world of working parents and makeshift day care, the need to assess the impact of parenting styles and the bond between child and caregiver is more urgent than ever. Karen addresses such issues as: What do children need to feel that the world is a positive place and that they have value? Is day care harmful for children under one year? What experiences in infancy will enable a person to develop healthy relationships as an adult?, and he demonstrates how different approaches to mothering are associated with specific infant behaviors, such as clinginess, avoidance, or secure exploration. He shows how these patterns become ingrained and how they reveal themselves at age two, in the preschool years, in middle childhood, and in adulthood. And, with thought-provoking insights, he gives us a new understanding of how negative patterns and insecure attachment can be changed and resolved throughout a person&#8217;s life.<br />
                     The infant is in many ways a great mystery to us. Every one of us has been one; many of us have lived with or raised them. Becoming Attached is not just a voyage of discovery in child emotional development and its pertinence to adult life but a voyage of personal discovery as well, for it is impossible to read this book without reflecting on one&#8217;s own life as a child, a parent, and an intimate partner in love or marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION * BEST BOOKS OF 2016 SELECTION BY THE BOSTON GLOBE * ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY * NPR * CHICAGO PUBLIC LIBRARY *    </p>
<p>                     The New York Times bestselling investigation into the sexual, economic, and emotional lives of women is &#8220;an informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just the single ladies-who want to gain a greater understanding of this pivotal moment in the history of the United States&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review).    </p>
<p>                    In 2009, award-winning journalist Rebecca Traister started All the Single Ladies about the twenty-first century phenomenon of the American single woman. It was the year the proportion of American women who were married dropped below fifty percent; and the median age of first marriages, which had remained between twenty and twenty-two years old for nearly a century (1890-1980), had risen dramatically to twenty-seven.    </p>
<p>                    But over the course of her vast research and more than a hundred interviews with academics and social scientists and prominent single women, Traister discovered a startling truth: the phenomenon of the single woman in America is not a new one. And historically, when women were given options beyond early heterosexual marriage, the results were massive social change-temperance, abolition, secondary education, and more. Today, only twenty percent of Americans are married by age twenty-nine, compared to nearly sixty percent in 1960.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An informative and thought-provoking book for anyone-not just single ladies&#8221; (The New York Times Book Review), All the Single Ladies is a remarkable portrait of contemporary American life and how we got here, through the lens of the unmarried American woman. Covering class, race, sexual orientation, and filled with vivid anecdotes from fascinating contemporary and historical figures, &#8220;we&#8217;re better off reading Rebecca Traister on women, politics, and America than pretty much anyone else&#8221; (The Boston Globe).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Does anyone date anymore?&#8221; Today, the authorities tell us that courtship is in crisis. But when Moira Weigel dives into the history of sex and romance in modern America, she discovers that authorities have always said this. Ever since young men and women started to go out together, older generations have scolded them: That&#8217;s not the way to find true love. The first women who made dates with strangers were often arrested for prostitution; long before &#8220;hookup culture,&#8221; there were &#8220;petting parties&#8221;; before parents worried about cell phone apps, they fretted about joyrides and &#8220;parking.&#8221; Dating is always dying. But this does not mean that love is dead. It simply changes with the economy. Dating is, and always has been, tied to work.     </p>
<p>                    Lines like &#8220;I&#8217;ll pick you up at six&#8221; made sense at a time when people had jobs that started and ended at fixed hours. But in an age of contract work and flextime, many of us have become sexual freelancers, more likely to text a partner &#8220;u still up?&#8221; Weaving together over one hundred years of history with scenes from the contemporary landscape, Labor of Love offers a fresh feminist perspective on how we came to date the ways we do. This isn&#8217;t a guide to &#8220;getting the guy.&#8221; There are no ridiculous &#8220;rules&#8221; to follow. Instead, Weigel helps us understand how looking for love shapes who we are&#8211;and hopefully leads us closer to the happy ending that dating promises.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;After years of debate and inquiry, the key to a great marriage remained shrouded in mystery. Until now&#8230;&#8221;&#8211;Carol Dweck, author of Mindset: The New Psychology of Success     </p>
<p>                    Eli J. Finkel&#8217;s insightful and ground-breaking investigation of marriage clearly shows that the best marriages today are better than the best marriages of earlier eras. Indeed, they are the best marriages the world has ever known. He presents his findings here for the first time in this lucid, inspiring guide to modern marital bliss.     </p>
<p>                    The All-or-Nothing Marriage reverse engineers fulfilling marriages&#8211;from the &#8220;traditional&#8221; to the utterly nontraditional&#8211;and shows how any marriage can be better.     </p>
<p>                    The primary function of marriage from 1620 to 1850 was food, shelter, and protection from violence; from 1850 to 1965, the purpose revolved around love and companionship. But today, a new kind of marriage has emerged, one oriented toward self-discover, self-esteem, and personal growth. Finkel combines cutting-edge scientific research with practical advice; he considers paths to better communication and responsiveness; he offers guidance on when to recalibrate our expectations; and he even introduces a set of must-try &#8220;lovehacks.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    This is a book for the newlywed to the empty nester, for those thinking about getting married or remarried, and for anyone looking for illuminating advice that will make a real difference to getting the most out of marriage today.</p>
