										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;A fascinating look at how consumers perceive logos, ads, commercials, brands, and products.&#8221;&#8211;Time     </p>
<p>                    How much do we know about why we buy? What truly influences our decisions in today&#8217;s message-cluttered world? In Buyology, Martin Lindstrom presents the astonishing findings from his groundbreaking three-year, seven-million-dollar neuromarketing study&#8211;a cutting-edge experiment that peered inside the brains of 2,000 volunteers from all around the world as they encountered various ads, logos, commercials, brands, and products. His startling results shatter much of what we have long believed about what captures our interest&#8211;and drives us to buy. Among the questions he explores:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Does sex actually sell?<br />
                    &#8211; Does subliminal advertising still surround us?<br />
                    &#8211; Can &#8220;cool&#8221; brands trigger our mating instincts?<br />
                    &#8211; Can our other senses&#8211;smell, touch, and sound&#8211;be aroused when we see a product?     </p>
<p>                    Buyology is a fascinating and shocking journey into the mind of today&#8217;s consumer that will captivate anyone who&#8217;s been seduced&#8211;or turned off&#8211;by marketers&#8217; relentless attempts to win our loyalty, our money, and our minds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Walmart provides a detailed assessment of the world&#8217;s largest retailer that forever changed the face of retailing. The book examines Walmart&#8217;s successes, failures, and whether it can stay ahead for the next 50 years. Despite being a source for best practice in procurement, logistics, systems and store format innovation, the retail giant is now facing several issues that affect its future development. Starting from its inception in rural Arkansas in 1962, this objective analysis of Walmart&#8217;s history addresses the rapid change of retail, including the rise of e-commerce and multi-channel retailing; Walmart International and its &#8216;everyday low prices&#8217; philosophy; the saturation of the superstore format, and much more.     </p>
<p>                    In a time of rapid change, will the world&#8217;s largest retailer be able to reconfigure? Walmart provides the necessary insights for retailers, advertisers, other business professionals and students to understand how Walmart became a retail giant, the lessons that can be learned, and what is in store for the future.</p>
