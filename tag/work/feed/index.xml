<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Everyone knows Dr. Watson is Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s right-hand man, so when he goes missing, it&#8217;s a shock. Even Sherlock hasn&#8217;t the slightest clue as to where he could be. Enola is intrigued but wary; she&#8217;s still hiding from her older brothers, and getting involved could prove to be disastrous. But Enola can&#8217;t help but investigate, especially when she learns that a bizarre bouquet&#8211;with flowers all symbolizing death&#8211;has been delivered to the Watson residence. Enola knows she must act quickly, but can she find Dr. Watson in time?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The monumental bestseller Quiet has been recast in a new edition that empowers introverted kids and teens      </p>
<p>                     Susan Cain sparked a worldwide conversation when she published Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#8217;t Stop Talking. With her inspiring book, she permanently changed the way we see introverts and the way introverts see themselves.     </p>
<p>                     The original book focused on the workplace, and Susan realized that a version for and about kids was also badly needed. This book is all about kids&#8217; world&#8211;school, extracurriculars, family life, and friendship. You&#8217;ll read about actual kids who have tackled the challenges of not being extroverted and who have made a mark in their own quiet way. You&#8217;ll hear Susan Cain&#8217;s own story, and you&#8217;ll be able to make use of the tips at the end of each chapter. There&#8217;s even a guide at the end of the book for parents and teachers.     </p>
<p>                     This insightful, accessible, and empowering book, illustrated with amusing comic-style art, will be eye-opening to extroverts and introverts alike.</p>
