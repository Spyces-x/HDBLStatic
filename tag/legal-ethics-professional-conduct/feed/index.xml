										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times number one bestseller.<br />
                    Winner of the Books are My Bag Non-Fiction Award.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Waterstones Book of the Year.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Specsavers Non-Fiction Book of the Year.</p>
<p>                    You may not wish to think about it, but one day you or someone you love will almost certainly appear in a criminal courtroom. You might be a juror, a victim, a witness or &#8211; perhaps through no fault of your own &#8211; a defendant. Whatever your role, you&#8217;d expect a fair trial.</p>
<p>                      I&#8217;m a barrister. I work in the criminal justice system, and every day I see how fairness is not guaranteed. Too often the system fails those it is meant to protect. The innocent are wronged and the guilty allowed to walk free.</p>
<p>                    In The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It&#8217;s Broken I want to share some stories from my daily life to show you how the system is broken, who broke it and why we should start caring before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times top ten bestseller for twenty-four weeks.<br />
                    &#8216;Eye-opening, funny and horrifying&#8217; &#8211; Observer<br />
                    &#8216;Everyone who has any interest in public life should read it&#8217; &#8211; Daily Mail</p>
