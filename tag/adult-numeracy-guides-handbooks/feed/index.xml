										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, WALL STREET JOURNAL, AND INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Discover #1 New York Times bestselling author David Bach&#8217;s three secrets to financial freedom in an engaging story that will show you that you are richer than you think. Drawing on the author&#8217;s experiences teaching millions of people around the world to live a rich life, this fast, easy listen reveals how anyone-from millennials to baby boomers-can still make his or her dreams come true.    </p>
<p>                    In this compelling, heartwarming parable, Bach and his bestselling coauthor John David Mann (The Go-Giver) tell the story of Zoey, a twenty-something woman living and working in New York City. Like many young professionals, Zoey is struggling to make ends meet under a growing burden of credit card and student loan debt, working crazy hours at her dream job but still not earning enough to provide a comfortable financial cushion. At her boss&#8217;s suggestion, she makes friends with Henry, the elderly barista at her favorite Brooklyn coffee shop.    </p>
<p>                    Henry soon reveals his &#8220;Three Secrets to Financial Freedom,&#8221; ideas Zoey dismisses at first but whose true power she ultimately comes to appreciate. Over the course of a single week, Zoey discovers that she already earns enough to secure her financial future and realize her truest dreams-all she has to do is make a few easy shifts in her everyday routine.    </p>
<p>                    The Latte Factor demystifies the secrets to achieving financial freedom, inspiring you to realize that it&#8217;s never too late to reach for your dreams. By following the simple, proven path that Henry shows Zoey, anyone can make small changes today that will have big impact for a lifetime, proving once again that &#8220;David Bach is the financial expert to listen to when you&#8217;re intimidated by your finances&#8221; (Tony Robbins, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Money: Master the Game).</p>
