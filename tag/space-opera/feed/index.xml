<p>                    Persepolis Rising is the seventh novel in the New York Times bestselling and Hugo-award winning Expanse series.</p>
<p>                    In  the thousand-sun network of  humanity&#8217;s expansion, new colony worlds  are struggling to find their  way. Every new planet lives on a  knife-edge between collapse and wonder,  and the crew of the ageing  gunship Rocinante have their hands more than full keeping the fragile peace.</p>
<p>                    In   the vast space between Earth and Jupiter, the inner planets and the   Belt have formed a tentative and uncertain alliance, still haunted by a   history of wars and prejudices. On the lost colony world of Laconia, a   hidden enemy has a new vision for all of humanity &#8211; and the power to   enforce it.</p>
<p>                    New technologies clash with old, as the history of   human conflict returns to its ancient pattern of war and subjugation.   But human nature is not the only enemy, and the forces being unleashed   have their own price. A price that will change the shape of humanity &#8211;   and of the Rocinante &#8211; unexpectedly and for ever . . .</p>
<p>                    The Expanse is the biggest science fiction series of the last decade and is now a major TV series.</p>

<p>                    Leviathan Wakes is the first book in the New York Times bestselling and Hugo-award winning Expanse series &#8211; over 4 million copies sold worldwide.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Interplanetary adventure the way it ought to be&#8217; George R. R. Martin</p>
<p>                    Humanity  has colonised the solar system &#8211; Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt and  beyond &#8211; but the stars are still out of our reach. </p>
<p>                    Jim Holden is  an officer on an ice miner making runs from the rings of Saturn to the  mining stations of the Belt. When he and his crew discover a derelict  ship called the Scopuli, they suddenly find themselves in  possession of a deadly secret. A secret that someone is willing to kill  for, and on an unimaginable scale. War is coming to the system, unless  Jim can find out who abandoned the ship and why. </p>
<p>                    Detective  Miller is looking for a girl. One girl in a system of billions, but her  parents have money &#8211; and money talks. When the trail leads him to the Scopuli and Holden, they both realise this girl may hold the key to everything. </p>
<p>                    Holden  and Miller must thread the needle between the Earth government, the  Outer Planet revolutionaries and secret corporations, and the odds are  against them. But out in the Belt, the rules are different, and one  small ship can change the fate of the universe.</p>
<p>                    The Expanse is the biggest science fiction series of the last decade and is now a major TV series.</p>

<p>                    Cibola Burn is the fourth book in the New York Times bestselling and Hugo-award winning Expanse series.</p>
<p>                    The gates have opened the way to a thousand new worlds and the rush to  colonise has begun. Settlers looking for a new life stream out from  humanity&#8217;s home planets. Illus, the first human colony on this vast new  frontier, is being born in blood and fire. </p>
<p>                    Independent settlers  stand against the overwhelming power of a corporate colony ship with  only their determination, courage and the skills learned in the long  wars of home. Innocent scientists are slaughtered as they try to survey a  new and alien world.</p>
<p>                    James Holden and the crew of his one small  ship are sent to make peace in the midst of war and sense in the heart  of chaos. But the more he looks at it, the more Holden thinks the  mission was meant to fail. </p>
<p>                    And the whispers of a dead man remind him that the great galactic civilisation which once stood on this land is gone. And that something killed them.</p>
<p>                    The Expanse is the biggest science fiction series of the last decade and is now a major TV series.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*FROM THE SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLING AUTHOR AND HUGO AWARD WINNER FOR BEST SERIES*</p>
<p>                    The stunning finale to the award-winning Wayfarers series by Becky Chambers, author of the beloved The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet.</p>
<p>                    When a freak technological failure halts traffic to and from the planet Gora, three strangers are thrown together unexpectedly, with seemingly nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>                    Pei is a cargo runner at a personal crossroads, torn between her duty to her people, and her duty to herself. </p>
<p>                    Roveg is an exiled artist, with a deeply urgent, and longed for, family appointment to keep.</p>
<p>                    Speaker has never been far from her twin but now must endure the unendurable: separation.</p>
<p>                    Under the care of Ouloo, an enterprising alien, and Tupo, her occasionally helpful child, the trio are compelled to confront where they&#8217;ve been, where they might go, and what they might be to one another.</p>
<p>                    Together they will discover that even in the vastness of space, they&#8217;re not alone.</p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR THE WAYFARERS </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Becky Chambers is a wonder, and I feel better for having her books in my life&#8217; JOHN CONNOLLY</p>
<p>                    &#8216;In a word, brilliant&#8217; ANDREW CALDECOTT</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A quietly profound, humane tour de force&#8217; GUARDIAN</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Chambers is simply an exceptional talent&#8217; TOR.COM</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Becky Chambers takes space opera in a whole new and unexpected direction&#8217; BEN AARONOVITCH</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she&#8217;s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumours of his cowardice are true &#8211; he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them. </p>
<p>                     Spensa is sure there&#8217;s more to the story. And she&#8217;s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars &#8211; and it was terrifying. What she learned turned her world upside down. Everything Spensa&#8217;s been taught is a lie. </p>
<p>                     But Spensa also learned a few things about herself &#8211; and she&#8217;ll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to. </p>
<p>                    Praise for Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s #1 New York Times Bestselling Reckoners series:</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Another win for Sanderson . . . he&#8217;s simply a brilliant writer&#8217; Patrick Rothfuss<br />
                     &#8216;Action-packed&#8217; Entertainment Weekly<br />
                     &#8216;Compelling . . . Sanderson uses plot twists that he teases enough for readers to pick up on to distract from the more dramatic reveals he has in store&#8217; AV Club</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nine hundred thousand years ago, something wiped out the Amarantin. For the human colonists now settling the Amarantin homeworld Resurgam, it&#8217;s of little more than academic interest, even after the discovery of a long-hidden, almost perfect Amarantin city and a colossal statue of a winged Amarantin. For brilliant but ruthless scientist Dan Sylveste, it&#8217;s more than merelty intellectual curiosity &#8211; and he will stop at nothing to get at the truth. Even if the truth costs him everything. But the Amarantin were wiped out for a reason, and that danger is closer and greater than even Syveste imagines &#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come to Chasm City and embark on a mind-bending ride through the universe of Revelation Space    </p>
<p>                    Tanner Mirabel was a security specialist who never made a mistake &#8211; until the day a woman in his care was blown away by Argent Reivich, a vengeful young postmortal. Tanner&#8217;s pursuit of Reivich takes him across light-years of space to Chasm City, the domed human settlement on the otherwise inhospitable planet of Yellowstone.    </p>
<p>                    But Chasm City is not what it was. The one time high-tech utopia has become a Gothic nightmare: a nanotechnological virus has corrupted the city&#8217;s inhabitants as thoroughly as it has the buildings and machines. Before the chase is done, Tanner will have to confront truths which reach back centuries, towards deep space and an atrocity history barely remembers.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take another awe-inspiring leap into the darkly imagined future of REVELATION SPACE, where it is time for Humanity to meet its Unmakers.    </p>
<p>                    Mankind has endured centuries of horrific plague and a particularly brutal interstellar war &#8230; but there is still no time for peace and quiet.    </p>
<p>                    Stirred from aeons of sleep, the Inhibitors &#8211; ancient alien killing machines &#8211; have begun the process of ridding the galaxy of its latest emergent intelligence: mankind. As a ragtag bag of refugees fleeing the first wave of the cull head towards an apparently insignificant moon light-years away, they discover an avenging angel, a girl born in ice. She has the power to lead mankind to safety, and the ability to draw down their darkest enemy.    </p>
<p>                    And on a planet where vast travelling cathedrals crawl towards the treacherous fissure known as Absolution Gap, an unsettling truth becomes apparent: to beat one enemy, it may be necessary to forge an alliance with something much, much worse &#8230;    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AS SEEN ON BARACK OBAMA&#8217;S 2021 SUMMER READING LIST<br />
                    &#8216;THE MOST ENJOYABLE HARD SF I HAVE READ IN YEARS&#8217; THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>                    OUT NOW from the bestselling author of THE MARTIAN</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Weir&#8217;s finest work to date. . . This is the one book I read last year that I am certain I can recommend to anyone, no matter who, and know they&#8217;ll love it.&#8217; BRANDON SANDERSON</p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you like a lot of science in your science fiction, Andy Weir is the writer for you. . . This one has everything fans of old school SF (like me) love.&#8217; GEORGE R.R. MARTIN</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brilliantly funny and enjoyable. One of the most plausible science fiction books I&#8217;ve ever read&#8217; TIM PEAKE, astronaut<br />
                    ________________________________________<br />
                    A lone astronaut.<br />
                    An impossible mission.<br />
                    An ally he never imagined.</p>
<p>                    Ryland Grace is the sole survivor on a desperate, last-chance mission &#8211; and if he fails, humanity and the earth itself will perish.</p>
<p>                    Except that right now, he doesn&#8217;t know that. He can&#8217;t even remember his own name, let alone the nature of his assignment or how to complete it.</p>
<p>                    All he knows is that he&#8217;s been asleep for a very, very long time. And he&#8217;s just been awakened to find himself millions of miles from home, with nothing but two corpses for company.</p>
<p>                    His crewmates dead, his memories fuzzily returning, Ryland realizes that an impossible task now confronts him. Hurtling through space on this tiny ship, it&#8217;s up to him to puzzle out an impossible scientific mystery-and conquer an extinction-level threat to our species.</p>
<p>                    And with the clock ticking down and the nearest human being light-years away, he&#8217;s got to do it all alone.</p>
<p>                    Or does he?</p>
<p>                    An irresistible interstellar adventure as only Andy Weir could imagine it, Project Hail Mary is a tale of discovery, speculation, and survival to rival The Martian &#8212; while taking us to places it never dreamed of going.<br />
                    ________________________________________<br />
                    &#8216;One of the most original, compelling, and fun voyages I&#8217;ve ever taken.&#8217; ERNEST CLINE, author of Ready Player One and Ready Player Two</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Undisputedly the best book I&#8217;ve read in a very, very long time. Mark my words: Project Hail Mary is destined to become a classic.&#8217; BLAKE CROUCH</p>
<p>                    &#8216;An unforgettable story of survival and the power of friendship &#8211; nothing short of a science-fiction masterwork.&#8217; KIRKUS REVIEWS</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A suspenseful portrait of human ingenuity and resilience [that] builds to an unexpectedly moving ending. A winner.&#8217; PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Weir returns with gusto . . . his writing flows naturally, and his characters and dialogue crackle with energy. With this novel, he takes his place as a genuine star in the mainstream SF world.&#8217; BOOKLIST</p>

<p>                    The Traitor Host of Horus Lupercal tightens its iron grip on the Palace of Terra, and one by one the walls and bastions begin to crumple and collapse. Rogal Dorn, Praetorian of Terra, redoubles his efforts to keep the relentless enemy at bay, but his forces are vastly outnumbered and hopelessly outgunned. Dorn simply cannot defend everything. Any chance of survival now requires sacrifice, but what battles dare he lose so that others can be won? Is there one tactical stroke, one crucial combat, that could turn the tide forever and win the war outright?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Inhibitors are back and Humanity is doomed!</p>
<p>                    Many, many millennia ago, the Inhibitors seeded the universe with machines designed to detect intelligent life &#8211; and then to suppress it. But after hundreds of millions of years, the machines started to fail and intelligent cultures started to emerge.</p>
<p>                    Then Dr Dan Sylveste and the crew of Infinity discovered what had happened to the long-vanished Amarantin race &#8230; and awakened the Inhibitors.</p>
<p>                    On Yellowstone, where no one is quite who they appear, the Inquisitor and the planet&#8217;s Most Wanted War Criminal are watching as the Inhibitors turn a small group of planets into raw materials. Whatever they are building with those materials is not going to be good for Humanity.</p>
<p>                    Once again, Al Reynolds has produced a stunning, universe-spanning space opera of mind-blowing proportions. Big in size, big in concepts, REDEMPTION ARK will leave you gasping at its audacity and breathless at its conclusion.</p>
<p>                    This is British SF at its absolute best.</p>

<p>                    Auf dem Weg zu einem weit entfernten Planeten am anderen Ende der Galaxie entdeckt die Crew des Kolonisierungsraumschiffs Covenant einen Planeten, den sie für ein unentdecktes Paradies halten. Doch der vermeintliche Garten Eden entpuppt sich schnell als dunkle und gefährliche Welt.    </p>
<p>                    Als die Crew sich daraufhin einer entsetzlichen Bedrohung jenseits ihres Vorstellungsvermögens gegenüber sieht, bleibt ihr nichts anderes als die Flucht. Doch diese fordert gnadenlos ihre Opfer &#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Alien: Covenant ist das Schlüsselabenteuer, das dem bahnbrechenden ersten ALIEN-Film voraus geht und zu Ereignissen führt, die den Kreis zu einer der furchterregendsten Sagas aller Zeiten schließen.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My most anticipated book of the year&#8217; &#8211; Peter F. Hamilton, Britain&#8217;s no.1 science fiction writer</p>
<p>                    Children of Ruin follows Adrian Tchaikovsky&#8217;s extraordinary Children of Time, winner of the Arthur C. Clarke award. It is set in the same universe, with new characters and a thrilling narrative.</p>
<p>                    It has been waiting through the ages. Now it&#8217;s time . . .</p>
<p>                    Thousands of years ago, Earth&#8217;s terraforming program took to the stars. On the world they called Nod, scientists discovered alien life &#8211; but it was their mission to overwrite it with the memory of Earth. Then humanity&#8217;s great empire fell, and the program&#8217;s decisions were lost to time.</p>
<p>                    Aeons later, humanity and its new spider allies detected fragmentary radio signals between the stars. They dispatched an exploration vessel, hoping to find cousins from old Earth.</p>
<p>                    But those ancient terraformers woke something on Nod better left undisturbed.</p>
<p>                    And it&#8217;s been waiting for them.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Books like this are why we read science fiction&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Ian McDonald, author of the Luna series</p>
<p>                    All underpinned by great ideas. And it is crisply modern &#8211; but with the sensibility of classic science fiction&#8217;<br />
                    Stephen Baxter, author of the Long Earth series (with Terry Pratchett)</p>

<p>                    The desert planet Arrakis, called Dune, has been destroyed. The remnants of the Old Empire have been consumed by the violent matriarchal cult known as the Honored Matres. Only one faction remains a viable threat to their total conquest&#8211;the Bene Gesserit, heirs to Dune&#8217;s power.     </p>
<p>                    Under the leadership of Mother Superior Darwi Odrade, the Bene Gesserit have colonized a green world on the planet Chapterhouse and are turning it into a desert, mile by scorched mile. And once they&#8217;ve mastered breeding sandworms, the Sisterhood will control the production of the greatest commodity in the known galaxy&#8211;the spice melange. But their true weapon remains a man who has lived countless lifetimes&#8211;a man who served under the God Emperor Paul Muad&#8217;Dib&#8230;.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you loved The Passage, World War Z, The Martian or Interstellar: this is a must-read thriller for you.</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>                    Deadwood, USA. A girl sneaks out just before dark to ride her new bike. Suddenly, the ground disappears beneath her. Waking up at the bottom of a deep pit, she sees an emergency rescue team above her. The people looking down see something far stranger&#8230;</p>
<p>                    &#8220;We always look forward. We never look back.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    That girl grows up to be Dr. Rose Franklyn, a brilliant scientist and the leading world expert on what she discovered. An enormous, ornate hand made of an exceptionally rare metal, which predates all human civilisation on the continent. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;But this thing &#8230; it&#8217;s different. It challenges us. It rewrites history.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    An object whose origins and purpose are perhaps the greatest mystery humanity has ever faced. Solving the secret of where it came from &#8211; and how many more parts may be out there &#8211; could change life as we know it.</p>
<p>                    &#8220;It dares us to question what we know about ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    But what if we were meant to find it? And what happens when this vast, global puzzle is complete&#8230;?</p>
<p>                    &#8220;About everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    * * *</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Bursts at the seams with big ideas. A sheer blast from start to finish. I haven&#8217;t had this much fun reading in ages&#8217; Blake Crouch, author of the Wayward Pines trilogy</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A stellar debut which masterfully blends sci-fi, political thriller and apocalyptic fiction. So much more than the sum of its parts &#8211; a page-turner of the highest order&#8217; Kirkus Reviews</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Reminiscent of The Martian and World War Z, this is a luminous conspiracy yarn that shoots for (and lands among) the stars&#8217; Pierce Brown, author of Red Rising</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>More than thirty years ago, Star Wars burst onto the big screen and became a cultural phenomenon. Now the next adventures in this blockbuster saga are poised to captivate old and new fans alike-beginning with the highly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Awakens. And alongside the cinematic debut comes the thrilling novel adaptation.    </p>
<p>                    Set years after Return of the Jedi, this stunning new action-packed adventure rockets us back into the world of Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Luke Skywalker, while introducing a host of exciting new characters. Darth Vader may have been redeemed and the Emperor vanquished, but peace can be fleeting, and evil does not easily relent. Yet the simple belief in good can still empower ordinary individuals to rise and meet the greatest challenges.    </p>
<p>                    So return to that galaxy far, far away, and prepare yourself for what happens when the Force awakens. . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times and USA Today best-selling author of Wool and the Molly Fyde saga comes a story of teenage colonists marooned on a distant planet     </p>
<p>                     WE WOKE IN FIRE     </p>
<p>                     Five hundred colonists have been sent across the stars to settle an alien planet. Vat-grown in a dream-like state, they are educated through simulations by an artificial intelligence and should awaken at thirty years old, fully-trained, and ready to tame the new world.<br />
                     But fifteen years in, an explosion on their vessel kills most of the homesteaders and destroys the majority of their supplies. Worse yet, the sixty that awaken and escape the flames are only half-taught and possess the skills least useful for survival.<br />
                     Naked and terrified, the teens stumble from their fiery baptism ill-prepared for the unfamiliar and harsh alien world around them. Though they attempt to work with the colony A.I. to build a home, tension and misery are rampant, escalating into battles for dominance.<br />
                     Soon they find that their worst enemy isn&#8217;t the hostile environment, the A.I., or the blast that nearly killed them. Their greatest danger is each other.    </p>

<p>                    Ten years ago, alien robots descended to Earth killing one hundred million people. And when they retreated, they took brilliant scientist Rose Franklin and her team with them. </p>
<p>                    Now, after nearly ten years on another world, Rose and the Earth Defence Corps manage to escape &#8211; only to find that a devastating new war has begun. This time, it&#8217;s between humans. </p>
<p>                    As the human race looks set to destroy itself, Rose and her comrades must find a way to unite Earth. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reminiscent of The Martian and World War Z&#8217; PIERCE BROWN</p>
<p>                    A twenty-story-tall metallic figure appears in the middle of Regent&#8217;s Park. The caretakers at London Zoo notice it first at around 4am. The figure, or robot, bears a great resemblance to the UN robot known as Themis . . . </p>
<p>                    Who made Themis?</p>
<p>                     It&#8217;s been ten years since Themis &#8211; a giant alien metal robot &#8211; was revealed to the world by Dr Rose Franklin. It now stands at the heart of the Earth Defense Corps &#8211; in case the makers of Themis return to claim it.</p>
<p>                     Why did they leave it here?</p>
<p>                     Rose and her team are still seeking answers to Themis&#8217;s origins when a second and even bigger robot appears in London&#8217;s Regent&#8217;s Park. A military response backfires, reducing half the city to bare earth.</p>
<p>                     And what if they come back?</p>
<p>                     As more robots appear across the world, Rose knows it&#8217;s a race against time to discover where they&#8217;ve come from, what they want and &#8211; most importantly &#8211; how to stop them . . .</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Captivating&#8217; BUZZFEED</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A sheer blast from start to finish. I haven&#8217;t had this much fun reading in ages&#8217; BLAKE CROUCH</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Non-stop action and adventure. In a word: unputdownable&#8217; KIRKUS</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Die Covenant Mission &#8211; das bislang ehrgeizigste Unterfangen in der Geschichte des Weyland-Yutani Konzerns. Ein Kolonisierungsraumschiff, das über zweitausend Kolonisten weit über die Grenzen des bislang bekannten Universums hinaus bin nach Origae-6 bringen soll. Ein entscheidender Schritt &#8211; für die Firma als auch die Zukunft der gesamten Menschheit.</p>
<p>                    Und doch gibt es Kräfte, welche die Mission verhindern wollen. Während die Covenant bereits im Orbit der Erde kreist und Captain Jacob Branson und seine Frau Daniels die letzten Vorbereitungen an Bord treffen, deuten mehrere Terroranschläge auf eine tödliche Verschwörung hin, deren Ziel es ist, den Start des Schiffes zu sabotieren. Zusammen mit Sicherheitschef Daniel Lopé, der auf der Erde noch das letzte fehlende Mitglied seines Teams rekrutiert, versuchen sie alles, die Urheber der Anschläge ausfindig zu machen, bevor diese das Schiff und seine Passagiere zerstören können.</p>
<p>                    ALAN DEAN FOSTER, gefeierter Autor der bahnbrechenden ALIEN-Romanversion, präsentiert mit ORIGINS einen eigenständigen Roman, der die Vorgeschichte der Ereignisse des Films ALIEN: COVENANT erzählt. Darüber hinaus lässt uns ALIEN: ORIGINS einen Einblick in jene Welt werfen, welche die Kolonisten für immer hinter sich lassen werden.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this exhiliarting sequel to Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson&#8217;s Hellhole,  the stakes on planet Hallholme have been raised to new heights.     </p>
<p>                    After declaring his independence from the corrupt Constellation, rebel General Adolphus knows the crackdown is coming. Now he needs to pull together the struggling Hellhole colony, the ever-expanding shadow-Xayan settlement, and his connections with the other Deep Zone worlds. Even then, he doubts his desperate measures will be enough.     </p>
<p>                    Diadem Michella Duchenet has collected a huge space fleet led by Commodore Escobar Hallholme, son of the hero who originally defeated Adolphus. They expect resistance from the General&#8217;s rebels, but who could possibly stand up to such a mighty fleet?     </p>
<p>                    Adolphus knows he&#8217;s running out of time, but he still has some hope&#8211;the shadow-Xayans have banded together to defend their sacred planet with telemancy, but can they discover new powers to protect all the stored alien lives on the already devastated world? And when all hope seems lost, the awakened Xayans reveal information hidden even from their own followers&#8211;the existence of a bigger threat that makes even the Constellation fleet seem insignificant.     </p>
<p>                    Disaster has come for General Adolphus and Hellhole&#8230;and this time there is no escape.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An unexpected offer threatens the bond between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi as the two Jedi navigate a dangerous new planet and an uncertain future in the first canon Star Wars novel to take place before the events of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. </p>
<p>                     A Jedi must be a fearless warrior, a guardian of justice, and a scholar in the ways of the Force. But perhaps a Jedi&#8217;s most essential duty is to pass on what they have learned. Master Yoda trained Dooku; Dooku trained Qui-Gon Jinn; and now Qui-Gon has a Padawan of his own. But while Qui-Gon has faced all manner of threats and danger as a Jedi, nothing has ever scared him like the thought of failing his apprentice. </p>
<p>                     Obi-Wan Kenobi has deep respect for his Master, but struggles to understand him. Why must Qui-Gon so often disregard the laws that bind the Jedi? Why is Qui-Gon drawn to ancient Jedi prophecies instead of more practical concerns? And why wasn&#8217;t Obi-Wan told that Qui-Gon is considering an invitation to join the Jedi Council&#8211;knowing it would mean the end of their partnership? The simple answer scares him: Obi-Wan has failed his Master. </p>
<p>                     When Jedi Rael Averross, another former student of Dooku, requests their assistance with a political dispute, Jinn and Kenobi travel to the royal court of Pijal for what may be their final mission together. What should be a simple assignment quickly becomes clouded by deceit, and by visions of violent disaster that take hold in Qui-Gon&#8217;s mind. As Qui-Gon&#8217;s faith in prophecy grows, Obi-Wan&#8217;s faith in him is tested&#8211;just as a threat surfaces that will demand that Master and apprentice come together as never before, or be divided forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The planet HELLHOLE, devastated by an ancient asteroid impact, is inhabited by only the hardiest and most desperate colonists. It is one of 54 remote frontier worlds forced to pay tribute to the corrupt Constellation, which is ruled by decadent nobles. An exiled rebel general, Tiber Adolphus, has now mounted a second rebellion against the Constellation, much larger than his earlier failed attempt.     </p>
<p>                    This time Adolphus aligns himself with the Xayans, a resurrected alien race from Hellhole. As the ancient civilization awakens, the Xayans encourage colonists to immerse themselves in strange slickwater pools and acquire ancient alien memories. Their goal is to gather sufficient numbers to achieve ala&#8217;ru, an accelerated evolution that will transform them into godlike beings.     </p>
<p>                    General Adolphus rallies his fellow rebels from across the vast Deep Zone to fight for their independence, while the ruthless leader of the Constellation, Diadem Michella, vows to eradicate the rebellion and all colonists on Hellhole. The Xayans add their telemancy defenses to the General&#8217;s conventional military resources, until they reveal an enemy far more terrifying than the Army of the Constellation: a faction of rogue Xayans bent on the extermination of their race . . . and the destruction of any planet that happens to be in the way.     </p>
<p>                    As a barrage of deadly asteroids hurtles toward Hellhole, and the Constellation&#8217;s gigantic space fleet arrives for a final engagement against General Adolphus, the hardy settlers are caught between a human enemy that wants to raze their colony to the ground and much more powerful aliens who can destroy not only themselves, but human civilization, as well as the foundations of the universe itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revolution brewing for generations has begun in fire.  It will end in blood.    </p>
<p>                    The Free Navy &#8211; a violent group of Belters in black-market military ships &#8211; has crippled the Earth and begun a campaign of piracy and violence among the outer planets.  The colony ships heading for the thousand new worlds on the far side of the alien ring gates are easy prey, and no single navy remains strong enough to protect them.    </p>
<p>                    James Holden and his crew know the strengths and weaknesses of this new force better than anyone. Outnumbered and outgunned, the embattled remnants of the old political powers call on the Rocinante for a desperate mission to reach Medina Station at the heart of the gate network.     </p>
<p>                    But the new alliances are as flawed as the old, and the struggle for power has only just begun.  As the chaos grows, an alien mystery deepens.  Pirate fleets, mutiny and betrayal may be the least of the Rocinante&#8217;s problems.  And in the uncanny spaces past the ring gates, the choices of a few damaged and desperate people may determine the fate of more than just humanity.</p>
