										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER<br />
                    A Guardian, Daily Telegraph, New Statesman and Daily Express Book of the Year</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hugely, highly and happily recommended&#8217; Stephen Fry<br />
                    &#8216;You should read Humankind. You&#8217;ll learn a lot (I did) and you&#8217;ll have good reason to feel better about the human race&#8217; Tim Harford<br />
                    &#8216;Made me see humanity from a fresh perspective&#8217; Yuval Noah Harari</p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s a belief that unites the left and right, psychologists and philosophers, writers and historians. It drives the headlines that surround us and the laws that touch our lives. From Machiavelli to Hobbes, Freud to Dawkins, the roots of this belief have sunk deep into Western thought. Human beings, we&#8217;re taught, are by nature selfish and governed by self-interest.</p>
<p>                    Humankind makes a new argument: that it is realistic, as well as revolutionary, to assume that people are good. By thinking the worst of others, we bring out the worst in our politics and economics too.</p>
<p>                    In this major book, internationally bestselling author Rutger Bregman takes some of the world&#8217;s most famous studies and events and reframes them, providing a new perspective on the last 200,000 years of human history. From the real-life Lord of the Flies to the Blitz, a Siberian fox farm to an infamous New York murder, Stanley Milgram&#8217;s Yale shock machine to the Stanford prison experiment, Bregman shows how believing in human kindness and altruism can be a new way to think &#8211; and act as the foundation for achieving true change in our society.</p>
<p>                    It is time for a new view of human nature.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What are philosophers trying to achieve? How can they succeed? Does philosophy make progress? Is it in competition with science, or doing something completely different, or neither?     </p>
<p>                    Timothy Williamson tackles some of the key questions surrounding philosophy in new and provocative ways, showing how philosophy begins in common sense curiosity, and develops through our capacity to dispute rationally with each other. Discussing philosophy&#8217;s ability to clarify our thoughts, he explains why such clarification depends on the development of philosophical theories, and how those theories can be tested by imaginative thought experiments, and compared against each other by standards<br />
                    similar to those used in the natural and social sciences. He also shows how logical rigour can be understood as a way of enhancing the explanatory power of philosophical theories. Drawing on the history of philosophy to provide a track record of philosophical thinking&#8217;s successes and failures,<br />
                    Williamson overturns widely held dogmas about the distinctive nature of philosophy in comparison to the sciences, demystifies its methods, and considers the future of the discipline.     </p>
<p>                    From thought experiments, to deduction, to theories,  this little book will cause you to totally rethink what philosophy is.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Muqaddimah, often translated as &#8220;Introduction&#8221; or &#8220;Prolegomenon,&#8221; is the most important Islamic history of the premodern world. Written by the great fourteenth-century Arab scholar Ibn Khaldun (d. 1406), this monumental work established the foundations of several fields of knowledge, including the philosophy of history, sociology, ethnography, and economics. The first complete English translation, by the eminent Islamicist and interpreter of Arabic literature Franz Rosenthal, was published in three volumes in 1958 as part of the Bollingen Series and received immediate acclaim in the United States and abroad. A one-volume abridged version of Rosenthal&#8217;s masterful translation first appeared in 1969. This Princeton Classics edition of the abridged version includes Rosenthal&#8217;s original introduction as well as a contemporary introduction by Bruce B. Lawrence. This volume makes available a seminal work of Islam and medieval and ancient history to twenty-first century audiences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is the philosophy of sweat? Reality TV? Domestic warfare? Making up and having sex? Take a sparkling ride through an ordinary day with hilarious philosophical gadfly Robert Rowland Smith in Breakfast with Socrates.     </p>
<p>                    Ever want to have a bagel with Hegel? Eggs with Bacon? Or spend a day with Socrates, Mill, Herodotus, or Kant, able to pick their brains about the most mundane moments of your life? Former Oxford Philosophy Fellow Robert Rowland Smith thought he would, and so with dry wit and marvelous invention, Smith whisks you through a typical day, injecting a little philosophy into it at every turn. Wake up with Descartes, go to work with Plato and Nietzsche, visit the gym with Kant, have sex with Ovid (or Simone de Beauvoir).     </p>
<p>                    As the day unfolds, Smith grounds complex, abstract ideas in concrete experience, giving you an informal introduction to applying philosophy to everyday life. Not only does Breakfast with Socrates cover the basic arguments of philosophy, it brings an irresistible, insouciant charm to its big questions, waking us up to the richest possible range of ideas on how to live. Neither breakfast, lunch, nor dinner will ever be the same again.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.&#8217; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    Everyone says they want to be happy. But that&#8217;s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness &#8211; from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#8217;s suggested routes to happiness and success &#8211; such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals &#8211; can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety.    </p>
<p>                    Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that &#8216;everything&#8217;s fine&#8217; even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Immensely positive and life-affirming&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;This is the blue print to a good life&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First published in 2000, this translation of one of the great works of Western political thought is based on the assumption that when Plato chose the dialogue form for his writing, he intended these dialogues to sound like conversations &#8211; although conversations of a philosophical sort. In addition to a vivid, dignified and accurate rendition of Plato&#8217;s text, the student and general reader will find many aids to comprehension in this volume: an introduction that assesses the cultural background to the Republic, its place within political philosophy, and its general argument; succinct notes in the body of the text; an analytical summary of the work&#8217;s content; a full glossary of proper names; a chronology of important events; and a guide to further reading. The result is an accomplished and accessible edition of this seminal work, suitable for philosophers and classicists as well as historians of political thought at all levels.</p>

On January 10, 1776, he published his pamphlet Common Sense,  a persuasive argument for the colonies&#8217; political and economic separation from Britain.<br />
                    Common Sense cites the evils of monarchy, accuses the British government of inflicting economic and social injustices upon the colonies, and points to the absurdity of an island attempting to rule a continent. Credited by George Washington as having changed the minds of many of his countrymen, the document sold over 500,000 copies within a few months.<br />
                    Today, Common Sense remains a landmark document in the struggle for freedom, distinguished not only by Paine&#8217;s ideas but also by its clear and passionate presentation. Designed to ignite public opinion against autocratic rule, the pamphlet offered a careful balance between imagination and judgment, and appropriate language and expression to fit the subject. It immediately found a receptive audience, heartened Washington&#8217;s despondent army, and foreshadowed much of the phrasing and substance of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to Think Like a Roman Emperor takes readers on a transformative journey along with Marcus, following his progress from a young noble at the court of Hadrian &#8211; taken under the wing of some of the finest philosophers of his day &#8211; through to his reign as emperor of Rome at the height of its power. Robertson shows how Marcus used philosophical doctrines and therapeutic practices to build emotional resilience and endure tremendous adversity, and guides readers through applying the same methods to their own lives.    </p>
<p>                    Combining remarkable stories from Marcus&#8217;s life with insights from modern psychology and the enduring wisdom of his philosophy, How to Think Like a Roman Emperor puts a human face on Stoicism and offers a timeless and essential guide to handling the ethical and psychological challenges we face today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After kicking open the doors to twentieth-century philosophy in Thus Spake Zarathustra,  Friedrich Nietzsche refined his ideal of the superman with the 1886 publication of Beyond Good and Evil. Conventional morality is a sign of slavery, Nietzsche maintains, and the superman goes beyond good and evil in action, thought, and creation. Nietzsche especially targets what he calls a slave morality that fosters herdlike quiescence and stigmatizes the highest human types.<br />
                    In this pathbreaking work, Nietzsche&#8217;s philosophical and literary powers are at their height: with devastating irony and flashing wit he gleefully dynamites centuries of accumulated conventional wisdom in metaphysics, morals, and psychology, clearing a path for such twentieth-century innovators as Thomas Mann, André Gide, Sigmund Freud, George Bernard Shaw, André Malraux, and Jean-Paul Sartre, all of whom openly acknowledged their debt to him.<br />
                    Students of philosophy and literature as well as general readers will prize this rich sampling of Nietzsche&#8217;s thought in an unabridged and inexpensive edition of one of the philosopher&#8217;s most important works.</p>
