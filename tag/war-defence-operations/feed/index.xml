										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praise for Sunday Times No.1 bestselling author Damien Lewis&#8217; SAS mission series:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of the great untold stories of WWII&#8217; &#8211; Bear Grylls on SAS Ghost Patrol</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The untold story&#8217; &#8211; Daily Mail on SAS Nazi Hunters</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A tale of bravery against desperate odds&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times on Churchill&#8217;s Secret Warriors</p>
<p>                    &#8216;True adventures laced with staggering bravery and sacrifice&#8217; &#8211; Sun on Hunting the Nazi Bomb</p>
<p>                    An impossible mission in wartime Italy: the next explosive bestseller from Damien Lewis.</p>
<p>                    In the hard-fought winter of 1944 the Allies advanced northwards through Italy, but stalled on the fearsome mountainous defences of the Gothic Line. Two men were parachuted in, in an effort to break the deadlock. Their mission: to penetrate deep into enemy territory and lay waste to the Germans&#8217; impregnable headquarters.</p>
<p>                    At the eleventh hour mission commanders radioed for David &#8216;The Mad Piper&#8217; Kilpatrick to be flown in, resplendent in his tartan kilt. They wanted this fearless war hero to lead the assault, piping Highland Laddie as he went &#8211; so leaving an indelible British signature to deter Nazi reprisals.</p>
<p>                    As the column of raiders formed up, there was shocking news. High command radioed through an order to stand down, having assessed the chances of success at little more than zero. But in defiance of orders, and come hell or high-water, they were going in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red teaming. It is a practice as old as the Devil&#8217;s Advocate, the eleventh-century Vatican official charged with discrediting candidates for sainthood. Today, red teams,comprised primarily of fearless skeptics and those assuming the role of saboteurs who seek to better understand the interests, intentions, and capabilities of institutions or potential competitors,are used widely in both the public and private sector. Red teaming, including simulations, vulnerability probes, and alternative analyses, helps institutions in competitive environments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses, challenge assumptions, and anticipate potential threats ahead of the next special operations raid, malicious cyberattack, or corporate merger. But not all red teams are created equal indeed, some cause more damage than they prevent. In  Red Team , national security expert Micah Zenko provides an in-depth investigation into the work of red teams, revealing the best practices, most common pitfalls, and most effective applications of these modern-day Devil&#8217;s Advocates. The best practices of red teaming can be applied to the CIA, NYPD, or a pharmaceutical company, and executed correctly they can yield impressive results: red teams give businesses an edge over their competition, poke holes in vital intelligence estimates, and troubleshoot dangerous military missions long before boots are on the ground. But red teams are only as good as leaders allow them to be, and Zenko shows not only how to create and empower red teams, but also what to do with the information they produce.Essential reading for business leaders and policymakers alike,  Red Team  will revolutionize the way organizations think about, exploit, compensate for, and correct their institutional strengths and weaknesses. Drawing on little-known case studies and unprecedented access to elite red teamers in the United States and abroad, Zenko shows how any group,from military units to friendly hackers,can win by thinking like the enemy.</p>
