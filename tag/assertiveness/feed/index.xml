										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inspired by her hugely popular podcast, How To Fail is Elizabeth Day&#8217;s brilliantly funny, painfully honest and insightful celebration of things going wrong.</p>
<p>This is a book for anyone who has ever failed. Which means it&#8217;s a book for everyone.</p>
<p>If I have learned one thing from this shockingly beautiful venture called life, it is this: failure has taught me lessons I would never otherwise have understood. I have evolved more as a result of things going wrong than when everything seemed to be going right. Out of crisis has come clarity, and sometimes even catharsis.</p>
<p>Part memoir, part manifesto, and including chapters on dating, work, sport, babies, families, anger and friendship, it is based on the simple premise that understanding why we fail ultimately makes us stronger. It&#8217;s a book about learning from our mistakes and about not being afraid.</p>
<p>Uplifting, inspiring and rich in stories from Elizabeth&#8217;s own life, How to Fail reveals that failure is not what defines us; rather it is how we respond to it that shapes us as individuals.</p>
<p>Because learning how to fail is actually learning how to succeed better. And everyone needs a bit of that.</p>

<p>                     Every day we speak around 16,000 words &#8211; but inside minds we create tens of thousands more. </p>
<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.</p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>                     Become aware of your true nature, learn to face your emotions with acceptance and generosity, act according to your deepest values, and flourish.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Essential reading&#8217; Susan Cain, author of Quiet</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A practical, science-backed guide to looking inward and living intentionally&#8217; Arianna Huffington, author of The Sleep Revolution</p>
<p>                    &#8216;An accessible, reader-friendly voyage. Emotional Agility can be helpful to anyone.&#8217; Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 25 years, Jim Kwik has helped everyone from celebrities to CEOs to students improve their memory, increase their decision-making skills, learn to speed-read and unleash their superbrains.    </p>
<p>                    In Limitless, readers will learn Jim&#8217;s revolutionary strategies and shortcuts to break free from their perceived limitations. They&#8217;ll learn how to supercharge their brains with simple, actionable tools to sharpen the mind, enhance focus and fast-track their fullest potential.    </p>
<p>                    The book is organized into four sections: Mindset, Motivation, Meta-Learning and Mission.

They&#8217;ll also learn how to conquer the four supervillains: Distraction, Digital Dementia, Digital Deluge and Depression.    </p>
<p>                    Believing that you are limited is holding you back from achieving your biggest dreams. But we all have superpowers inside of us, and the key to activating those superpowers is unlimiting yourself.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better &#8211; and thus we don&#8217;t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is &#8220;the elephant in the brain.&#8221; Such<br />
                    an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly &#8211; to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once<br />
                    everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?</p>
<p>                    Our unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their &#8220;official&#8221; ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies<br />
                    designed to favor or discourage them. You won&#8217;t see yourself &#8211; or the world &#8211; the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Break the rules, not the fast with world-renowned biohacker and New York Times bestselling author Dave Asprey.</p>
<p>                              For more than a decade, the Bulletproof founder Dave Asprey has shared his unique point of view and expertise to help fans become the best versions of themselves. From living longer to getting smarter, maximising performance to practising mindfulness, Dave&#8217;s followers look to him for his take on the most effective techniques to become healthier and more powerful than most doctors think is possible.</p>
<p>                              Asprey has been fasting for years, long before it gained widespread popularity, and if you&#8217;re a fan of The Bulletproof Diet, you have been enjoying some of the benefits of Intermittent Fasting too.</p>
<p>                              In Fast This Way, Dave asks readers to forget everything they think they know about the ancient practice and takes them on a journey through cutting-edge science to examine the ways novice fasters and Intermittent Fasting loyalists can up-end their relationship with food and upgrade their fasting game beyond calorie restriction.  </p>
<p>                     What IF eating the right foods at the right time can actually enhance your fast?<br />
                     What IF how you work out and sleep could trick your body into thinking you are fasting?<br />
                     What IF it were easy to skip a meal, or two, or three?<br />
                     What IF fasting is different for women, can be personalised to your genes, and can impact your mental health?<br />
                     What IF all fasts could be created equal?</p>
<p>                              Fast This Way is a compelling read through the latest thinking on fasting and gives readers the manual and toolkit to make the most of their fasts and their personal biology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; What if everything we think we know about how the world works&#8211;our ideas of love, education, spirituality, work, happiness, and love&#8211;are based on Brules (bullsh*t rules) that get passed from generation to generation and are long past their expiration date? </p>
<p>                    This book teaches you to think like some of the greatest non-conformist minds of our era, to question, challenge, hack, and create new rules for YOUR life so you can define success on your own terms. </p>
<p>                    The Code of the Extraordinary Mind is a blueprint of laws to break us free from the shackles of an ordinary life. It makes a case that everything we know about the world is shaped by conditioning and habit. And thus, most people live their lives based on limiting rules and outdated beliefs about pretty much everything&#8211;love, work, money, parenting, sex, health, and more&#8211;which they inherit and pass on from generation to generation. </p>
<p>                    But what if you could remove these outdated ideas and start anew? What would your life look like if you could forget the rules of the past, and redefine what happiness, purpose, and success mean for you? </p>
<p>                    Not Just a Book, but a Movement<br />
                    Blending computational thinking, integral theory, modern spirituality, evolutionary biology, and humor, personal growth entrepreneur Vishen Lakhiani provides a revolutionary 10-point framework for understanding and enhancing the human self. You will learn about bending reality. You will learn how to apply unique models like consciousness engineering to help you learn and grow at speeds like never before.You will learn to make a dent in the universe and discover your quest. This framework is based on Lakhiani&#8217;s personal experiences, the 5 million people he&#8217;s reached through Mindvalley, and 200 hours of interviews and questions posed to incredible minds, including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Peter Diamandis, Ken Wilber, Dean Kamen, Arianna Huffington, Michael Beckwith, and other legendary leaders. </p>
<p>                    In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, irreverence, and a brilliant teaching style, Lakhiani reveals the 10 powerful laws that form a step-by-step process that you can apply to life to shed years of struggle and elevate yourself to exceptional new heights. </p>
<p>                    The 10 Laws to an Extraordinary Life<br />
                    This book challenges conventional ideas of relationships, goal-setting, mindfulness, happiness, and meaning. In a unique fusion of cutting-edge ideas, personal stories, and humorous irreverence, and not to mention, humor and napkin diagrams,  this framework combines computational thinking with personal growth to provide a powerful framework for re-coding yourself&#8211;and replacing old, limiting models that hold you back with new, empowering beliefs and behaviors that set you on the path toward an extraordinary life. A life of more happiness and achievement than you might have dared to dream possible. </p>
<p>                    Once you discover the code, you will question your limits and realize that there are none. Step into a new understanding of the world around you and your place in it, and find yourself operating at a new, extraordinary level in every way&#8230;happiness, purpose, fulfilment, and love. </p>
<p>                    This Book Is a Living, Breathing Manifesto That Goes Beyond a Traditional Publication<br />
                    For those who want more, The Code of the Extraordinary Mind connects to a full on immersive experience including ways for you to dive into particular chapters to unlock additional videos or training and connect with each other and the author to learn via peer-to-peer learning networks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD</p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.</p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.</p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.</p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Show Up and Let Yourself be Seen</p>
<p>                    Is vulnerability the same as weakness? &#8220;In our culture,&#8221; teaches Dr. Brene Brown, &#8220;we associate vulnerability with emotions we want to avoid such as fear, shame, and uncertainty. Yet we too often lose sight of the fact that vulnerability is also the birthplace of joy, belonging, creativity, authenticity, and love.&#8221; On The Power of Vulnerability, Dr. Brown offers an invitation and a promise-that when we dare to drop the armor that protects us from feeling vulnerable, we open ourselves to the experiences that bring purpose and meaning to our lives. Here she dispels the cultural myth that vulnerability is weakness and reveals that it is, in truth, our most accurate measure of courage.</p>
<p>                    &#8220;The Power of Vulnerability is a very personal project for me,&#8221; Brene explains. &#8220;This is the first place that all of my work comes together. This audio course draws from all three of my books-it&#8217;s the culmination of everything I&#8217;ve learned over the past 12 years. I&#8217;m very excited to weave it all into a truly comprehensive form that shows what these findings and insights can mean in our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    Guidance and Insights for Wholehearted Living</p>
<p>                    Over the past 12 years, Dr. Brene Brown has interviewed hundreds of people as part of an ongoing study of vulnerability. &#8220;The research shows that we try to ward disappointment with a shield of cynicism, disarm shame by numbing ourselves against joy, and circumvent grief by shutting off our willingness to love,&#8221; explains Dr. Brown. When we become aware of these patterns, she teaches, we begin to become conscious of how much we sacrifice in the name of self-defense-and how much richer our lives become when we open ourselves to vulnerability.</p>
<p>                    &#8220;In my research,&#8221; Dr. Brown says, &#8220;the word I use to describe people who can live from a place of vulnerability is wholehearted.&#8221; Being wholehearted is a practice-one that we can choose to cultivate through empathy, gratitude, and awareness of our vulnerability armor. Join this engaging and heartfelt teacher on The Power of Vulnerability as she offers profound insights on leaning into the full spectrum of emotions-so we can show up, let ourselves be seen, and truly be all in.</p>
<p>                    Highlights:</p>
<p>                    Cultivating shame resilience-the key to developing a sense of worth and belonging<br />
                    * Vulnerability as the origin point for innovation, adaptability, accountability, and visionary leadership<br />

                    * Six hours of stories, warm humor, and transformative insights for living a life of courage, authenticity, and compassion from Dr. Brene Brown<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times Bestseller  In this generation-defining self-help guide, a superstar blogger cuts through the crap to show us how to stop trying to be &#8220;positive&#8221; all the time so that we can truly become better, happier people.  For decades, we&#8217;ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. &#8220;F**k positivity,&#8221; Mark Manson says. &#8220;Let&#8217;s be honest, shit is f**ked and we have to live with it.&#8221; In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn&#8217;t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is-a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is his antidote to the coddling, let&#8217;s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected modern society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up. Manson makes the argument, backed both by academic research and well-timed poop jokes, that improving our lives hinges not on our ability to turn lemons into lemonade, but on learning to stomach lemons better. Human beings are flawed and limited-&#8220;not everybody can be extraordinary, there are winners and losers in society, and some of it is not fair or your fault.&#8221;<br />
                    Manson advises us to get to know our limitations and accept them. Once we embrace our fears, faults, and uncertainties, once we stop running and avoiding and start confronting painful truths, we can begin to find the courage, perseverance, honesty, responsibility, curiosity, and forgiveness we seek. There are only so many things we can give a f**k about so we need to figure out which ones really matter, Manson makes clear. While money is nice, caring about what you do with your life is better, because true wealth is about experience. A much-needed grab-you-by-the-shoulders-and-look-you-in-the-eye moment of real-talk, filled with entertaining stories and profane, ruthless humor, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F**k is a refreshing slap for a generation to help them lead contented, grounded lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>
