										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to find the soft innovation that will make your product, service, school, church, or career worth talking about.  We live in an era of too much noise, too much clutter, too many choices, and too much spam. And as Seth Godin&#8217;s 200,000-copy bestseller Purple Cow taught the business world, the old ways of marketing simply don&#8217;t work anymore. The best way to sell anything these days is through word of mouth and the only real way to get word of mouth is to create something remarkable.  Free Prize Inside, the sequel to Purple Cow, explains how to do just that. It&#8217;s jammed with practical ideas you can use right now to make your product or service remarkable, so that it will virtually sell itself.  Remember when cereal came with a free prize inside? Even if you already liked the cereal, it was the little plastic toy that made it irresistible. Godin explains how you can think of a bonus that will make your customers feel just as excited, no matter what business you&#8217;re in. Consider these free prizes: &#8211; The Tupperware party, which turned buying plastic bowls into a social event<br />
                    &#8211; Flintstones vitamins, which turned a serious product into something fun<br />
                    &#8211; The free change-counting machine at every Commerce Bank branch<br />
                    &#8211; The little blue box from Tiffany, which makes people happy before they even open it  This book offers a way to create free prizes quickly, cheaply, and reliably and persuade others in your organization to help you bring them to life.</p>
