										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; In these hilarious essays, the Saturday Night Live head writer and Weekend Update co-anchor learns how to take a beating. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I always wanted to punch his face before I read this book. Now I just want to kick him in the balls.&#8221;&#8211;Larry David </p>
<p>                    NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY Cosmopolitan &#8211; Vulture &#8211; Parade</p>
<p>                    If there&#8217;s one trait that makes someone well suited to comedy, it&#8217;s being able to take a punch&#8211;metaphorically and, occasionally, physically. </p>
<p>                    From growing up in a family of firefighters on Staten Island to commuting three hours a day to high school and &#8220;seeing the sights&#8221; (like watching a Russian woman throw a stroller off the back of a ferry), to attending Harvard while Facebook was created, Jost shares how he has navigated the world like a slightly smarter Forrest Gump. </p>
<p>                    You&#8217;ll also discover things about Jost that will surprise and confuse you, like how Jimmy Buffett saved his life, how Czech teenagers attacked him with potato salad, how an insect laid eggs inside his legs, and how he competed in a twenty-five-man match at WrestleMania (and almost won). You&#8217;ll go behind the scenes at SNL and Weekend Update (where he&#8217;s written some of the most memorable sketches and jokes of the past fifteen years). And you&#8217;ll experience the life of a touring stand-up comedian&#8211;from performing in rural college cafeterias at noon to opening for Dave Chappelle at Radio City Music Hall. </p>
<p>                    For every accomplishment (hosting the Emmys), there is a setback (hosting the Emmys). And for every absurd moment (watching paramedics give CPR to a raccoon), there is an honest, emotional one (recounting his mother&#8217;s experience on the scene of the Twin Towers&#8217; collapse on 9/11). Told with a healthy dose of self-deprecation, A Very Punchable Face reveals the brilliant mind behind some of the dumbest sketches on television, and lays bare the heart and humor of a hardworking guy&#8211;with a face you can&#8217;t help but want to punch.</p>

                     &#8220;Howard Zinn on acid or some bullsh*t like that.&#8221; -Tim Heidecker</p>
<p>                     The creators of the cult-hit podcast Chapo Trap House deliver a manifesto for everyone who feels orphaned and alienated-politically, culturally, and economically-by the lanyard-wearing Wall Street centrism of the left and the lizard-brained atavism of the right: there is a better way, the Chapo Way.</p>
<p>                    In a guide that reads like &#8220;a weirder, smarter, and deliciously meaner version of The Daily Show&#8217;s 2004 America (The Book)&#8221; (Paste), Chapo Trap House shows you that you don&#8217;t have to side with either sinking ships. These self-described &#8220;assholes from the internet&#8221; offer a fully ironic ideology for all who feel politically hopeless and prefer broadsides and tirades to reasoned debate.</p>
<p>                     Learn the &#8220;secret&#8221; history of the world, politics, media, and everything in-between that THEY don&#8217;t want you to know and chart a course from our wretched present to a utopian future where one can post in the morning, game in the afternoon, and podcast after dinner without ever becoming a poster, gamer, or podcaster.</p>
<p>                     A book that&#8217;s &#8220;as intellectually serious and analytically original as it is irreverent and funny&#8221; (Glenn Greenwald, New York Times bestselling author of No Place to Hide) The Chapo Guide to Revolution features illustrated taxonomies of contemporary liberal and conservative characters, biographies of important thought leaders, &#8220;never before seen&#8221; drafts of Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s Newsroom manga, and the ten new laws that govern Chapo Year Zero (everyone gets a dog, billionaires are turned into Soylent, and logic is outlawed). If you&#8217;re a fan of sacred cows, prisoners being taken, and holds being barred, then this book is NOT for you. However, if you feel disenfranchised from the political and cultural nightmare we&#8217;re in, then Chapo, let&#8217;s go&#8230;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The #1 New York Times bestselling (mostly true) memoir from the hilarious author of Furiously Happy.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Gaspingly funny and wonderfully inappropriate.&#8221;&#8211;O, The Oprah Magazine     </p>
<p>                    When Jenny Lawson was little, all she ever wanted was to fit in. That dream was cut short by her fantastically unbalanced father and a morbidly eccentric childhood. It did, however, open up an opportunity for Lawson to find the humor in the strange shame-spiral that is her life, and we are all the better for it.     </p>
<p>                    In the irreverent Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Lawson&#8217;s long-suffering husband and sweet daughter help her uncover the surprising discovery that the most terribly human moments&#8211;the ones we want to pretend never happened&#8211;are the very same moments that make us the people we are today. For every intellectual misfit who thought they were the only ones to think the things that Lawson dares to say out loud, this is a poignant and hysterical look at the dark, disturbing, yet wonderful moments of our lives.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Roxane Gay is so great at weaving the intimate and personal with what is most bewildering and upsetting at this moment in culture. She is always looking, always thinking, always passionate, always careful, always right there.&#8221; &#8212; Sheila Heti, author of How Should a Person Be?    </p>
<p>                    A New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    Best Book of the Year: NPR &#8211; Boston Globe &#8211; Newsweek &#8211; Time Out New York &#8211; Oprah.com &#8211; Miami Herald &#8211; Book Riot &#8211; Buzz Feed &#8211; Globe and Mail (Toronto) &#8211; The Root &#8211; Shelf Awareness    </p>
<p>                    A collection of essays spanning politics, criticism, and feminism from one of the most-watched cultural observers of her generation    </p>
<p>                    In these funny and insightful essays, Gay takes us through the journey of her evolution as a woman (Sweet Valley High) of color (The Help) while also taking readers on a ride through culture of the last few years (Girls, Django in Chains) and commenting on the state of feminism today (abortion, Chris Brown). The portrait that emerges is not only one of an incredibly insightful woman continually growing to understand herself and our society, but also one of our culture.    </p>
<p>                    Bad Feminist is a sharp, funny, and spot-on look at the ways in which the culture we consume becomes who we are, and an inspiring call-to-arms of all the ways we still need to do better, coming from one of our most interesting and important cultural critics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Appalachian Trail trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America-majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you&#8217;re going to take a hike, it&#8217;s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you&#8217;ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way-and a couple of bears. Already a classic, A Walk in the Woods  will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With over 500,000 readers a month at her enormously popular blog, AwesomelyLuvvie.com, Luvvie Ajayi has become a go-to source for smart takes on pop culture. I&#8217;m Judging You is her debut book of humorous essays that dissects our cultural obsessions and calls out bad behavior in our increasingly digital, connected lives-from the cultural importance of the newest Shonda Rhimes television drama to serious discussions of race and media representation to what to do about your fool cousin sharing casket pictures from Grandma&#8217;s wake on Facebook. With a lighthearted, rapier wit and a unique perspective, I&#8217;m Judging You is the handbook the world needs, doling out the hard truths and a road map for bringing some &#8220;act right&#8221; into our lives, social media, and popular culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Raised by a pro-black, Pan-Afrikan single mother during the crack years of 1980s Washington, DC, and educated at Sidwell Friends School and Harvard University, Baratunde Thurston has over thirty years&#8217; experience being black. Now, through stories of his politically inspired Nigerian name, the heroics of his hippie mother, the murder of his drug-abusing father, and other revelatory black details, he shares with readers of all colors his wisdom and expertise in how to be black. Beyond memoir, this guidebook offers practical advice on everything from &#8220;How to Be The Black Friend&#8221; to &#8220;How to Be The (Next) Black President&#8221; to &#8220;How to Celebrate Black History Month&#8221;. To provide additional perspective, Baratunde assembled an award-winning Black Panel-three black women, three black men, and one white man (Christian Lander of &#8220;Stuff White People Like&#8221;) &#8211; and asked them such revealing questions as: When did you first realize you were black? How black are you? Can you swim? The result is a humorous, intelligent, and audacious guide that challenges and satirizes the so-called experts, purists, and racists who purport to speak for all black people.<br />
                    With honest storytelling and biting wit, Baratunde plots a path not just to blackness, but one open to anyone interested in simply how to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    FULLY REVISED &#038; UPDATED, WITH A NEW EPILOGUE    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Delightful.&#8221;-The Economist    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s Santa Claus, Shakespeare, Mickey Mouse, the Bible, and then there&#8217;s Star Wars. Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williams&#8217;s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.    </p>
<p>                              In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the films&#8217; wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author of the bestselling You Are Not So Smart gives readers a fighting chance at outsmarting their not-so-smart brains.      </p>
<p>                    A mix of popular psychology and trivia, You Are Now Less Dumb is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality&#8211;except we&#8217;re not. But that&#8217;s okay, because our delusions keep us sane.     </p>
<p>                    Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of seventeen ways we fool ourselves every day, including:<br />
                    Enclothed Cognition (the clothes you wear change your behavior and influence your mental abilities)The Benjamin Franklin Effect (how you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate the people you harm).Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality)The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater effect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us)Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don&#8217;t enjoy just to make the time or money already invested &#8220;worth it&#8221;)McRaney also reveals the true price of happiness, and how to avoid falling for our own lies.</p>
