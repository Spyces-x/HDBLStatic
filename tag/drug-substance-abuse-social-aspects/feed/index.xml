										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A former drug addict turned behavioural neuroscientist reveals how drugs work in the brain &#8211; and what we can do to fight addiction.    </p>
<p>                    Judith Grisel was a daily drug user when she began to consider that her addiction might have a cure, one that she herself could perhaps discover by studying the brain. Now, after twenty-five years as a neuroscientist, she shares what she and other scientists have learned about addiction, enriched by captivating glimpses of her personal journey.    </p>
<p>                    In Never Enough, Grisel reveals the unfortunate bottom line of all regular drug use: there is no such thing as a free lunch. All drugs act on the brain in a way that diminishes their enjoyable effects and creates unpleasant ones with repeated use. Delving into the science of one of the world&#8217;s most pressing health problems, she reveals what is different about the brains of addicts even before they first pick up a drink or drug, and highlights the changes that take place in the brain and behaviour as a result of chronic using.    </p>
<p>                    With compassion and clarity, Grisel describes what drove her to addiction, what helped her recover, and her belief that a &#8216;cure&#8217; for addiction will not be found in our individual brains but in the way we interact with our communities.</p>

<p>                    Named on Amazon&#8217;s Best Books of the Year 2015&#8211;Michael Botticelli, U.S. Drug Czar (Politico) Favorite Book of the Year&#8211;Angus Deaton, Nobel Prize Economics (Bloomberg/WSJ) Best Books of 2015&#8211;Matt Bevin, Governor of Kentucky (WSJ) Books of the Year&#8211;Slate.com&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2015&#8211;Entertainment Weekly&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2015 &#8211;Buzzfeed&#8217;s 19 Best Nonfiction Books of 2015&#8211;The Daily Beast&#8217;s Best Big Idea Books of 2015&#8211;Seattle Times&#8217; Best Books of 2015&#8211;Boston Globe&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;The Guardian&#8217;s The Best Book We Read All Year&#8211;Audible&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;Texas Observer&#8217;s Five Books We Loved in 2015&#8211;Chicago Public Library&#8217;s Best Nonfiction Books of 2015     </p>
<p>                    From a small town in Mexico to the boardrooms of Big Pharma to main streets nationwide, an explosive and shocking account of addiction in the heartland of America.     </p>
<p>                    In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America&#8211;addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland.     </p>
<p>                    With a great reporter&#8217;s narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma&#8217;s campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive&#8211;extremely addictive&#8211;miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin&#8211;cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico&#8217;s west coast, independent of any drug cartel&#8211;assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico.     </p>
<p>                    Introducing a memorable cast of characters&#8211;pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents&#8211;Quinones shows how these tales fit together. Dreamland is a revelatory account of the corrosive threat facing America and its heartland.</p>
