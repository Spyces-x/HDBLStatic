										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Best book ever!&#8217; &#8211; 5-star reader review</p>
<p>Theodore Boone, young lawyer, has had a lot to deal with in his thirteen years, everything from kidnapping to murder. But he&#8217;s come through it all and, with the law on his side, justice has always prevailed.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, the law doesn&#8217;t seem so just. His friend Hardie Quinn is about to have his family home bulldozed to make way for a bypass. Hardie is not the only one affected: other homes, businesses and schools lie in the path of the road. Theo has to tell his friend the bad news: for once, the law isn&#8217;t on his side, and there&#8217;s very little anyone can do to end the destruction.</p>
<p>Theo joins the campaign to stop the road. But when he stumbles on a terrible secret about the corrupt men behind the plan  &#8211; a secret it is illegal for him to know &#8211;  Theo must figure out how to keep the developers from breaking the law . . . without breaking it himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1956 Sarah Dewhurst&#8217;s father shocks her by hiring a dragon to work the farm. The dragon is a smaller blue rather than the traditional larger reds, though even the reds are now scarce. When the blue dragon, Kazimir, unexpectedly saves Sarah and her friend Jason Inagawa from the attentions of the racist police deputy, Kelby, everything changes. Sarah is part of a prophecy and she must escape the clutches of Malcolm, an assassin from a Believer Cell, the dragon-worshiping cult. When Sarah, Malcolm and Kazimir eventually converge, they are thrown into another universe, where dragons seem never to have existed. Can they save this world and the one they left?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>***Perfect for fans of Anthony Horowitz&#8217;s Alex Rider series***</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Not since Nancy Drew has a nosy, crime-obsessed kid been so hard to resist&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                     Woody Lambert is in trouble. He comes from a broken family, suffers bad grades at school and his older brother, Tony, is on probation for a drug offence. When Woody inadvertently gets caught up with Tony and one of his friends, Garth, cruising around Strattenburg in a beaten-up Mustang drinking beer, one thing leads to another and Garth holds up a convenience store with a fake gun. </p>
<p>                     Though he had no involvement in the crime other than being in Garth&#8217;s car, Woody is arrested as an accomplice. He&#8217;s going to need serious legal advice to avoid juvenile prison.</p>
<p>                     Enter Theodore Boone: after all, Theo has already decided that he will become the best courtroom lawyer in the state. It&#8217;s just that, at the age of thirteen, Theo is years from being a qualified lawyer &#8211; and Woody needs help right now . . . </p>
<p>                     ***********************</p>
<p>                     Further praise for the Theodore Boone series</p>
<p>                     &#8216;If you aspire to turn your children into lawyers who will keep you in your old age, John Grisham&#8217;s Theodore Boone, his first novel for young people, might be for you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times</p>
<p>                     &#8216;For any young readers tired of wizards, vampires and Greek gods, there&#8217;s now a new kid on the young fiction block, and this one really does have serious powers: Theodore Boone, half-boy, half-lawyer&#8230; fans will be pleased to know there will be more of Theo&#8217;s adventures to come&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Nobody does legal fiction better&#8217; &#8211; Daily Express</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Gripping . . . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good mystery. I think everyone will be enthralled by Theodore Boone&#8217; &#8211; Scholastic News</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Don&#8217;t miss the second series of His Dark Materials on BBC One this November.**</p>
<p>                    From the author of the phenomenal His Dark Materials comes the next chapter in the story of Lyra Silvertongue . . .</p>
<p>                     Lyra is now studying at St Sophia&#8217;s College, Oxford, with her daemon Pantalaimon. </p>
<p>                     But, for the first time there are serious divisions between the two.<br />
                    Lyra is questioning everything she once held dear. Pan misses the impulsiveness of their youth. </p>
<p>                     When an act of terrible violence breaks the peace of the Oxford night, Lyra and Pan&#8217;s relationship reaches a crisis and they are drawn, far from home, into the dangerous factions of a world they had no idea existed.</p>
<p>                     The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself and to grow up and make sense of the world around you. </p>
<p>                    This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.</p>
<p>                    *Exclusive to the paperback edition, Chris Wormell&#8217;s new original illustrations bring Lyra&#8217;s world vividly to life.*<br />
                     _____</p>
<p>                     Reviews for The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two:</p>
<p>                     &#8220;[Pullman] has created a fantasy world, made yet more satisfying in rigour and stylistic elegance. This is a book for getting older with&#8221; Guardian, Book of the Week</p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Secret Commonwealth is ablaze with light and life. The writing is exquisite; every sentence sings &#8230; To read Pullman is to experience the world refreshed, aglow, in Technicolour&#8221; i</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman&#8217;s story is still thought-provoking &#8230; This book elegantly weaves in live issues, from Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis to facts in the post-truth era. And Pullman&#8217;s prose is rewarding as ever&#8221; The Times</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A long, taxing, complex journey, laced with beauty, terror and philosophy&#8221; Metro</p>
<p>                     &#8220;As ever, Pullman&#8217;s story is complex and vast but home to some of the finest storytelling in the 21st century. Revel in whole new worlds and enjoy one of literature&#8217;s most wonderful heroines before she comes to HBO and the BBC&#8221; Stylist</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman is confronting readers with the horrors of our own world reflected back at us. In The Secret Commonwealthhe creates a fearful symmetry&#8221; The Herald</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Golding&#8217;s Lord of the Flies is a dystopian classic: &#8216;exciting, relevant and thought-provoking&#8217; (Stephen King). When a group of schoolboys are stranded on a desert island, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of my favorite books &#8211; I read it every couple of years.&#8217; (Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games)</p>
<p>                    A plane crashes on a desert island. The only survivors are a group of schoolboys. By day, they discover fantastic wildlife and dazzling beaches, learning to survive; at night, they are haunted by nightmares of a primitive beast. Orphaned by society, it isn&#8217;t long before their innocent childhood games devolve into a savage, murderous hunt &#8230; </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Stands out mightily in my memory &#8230; Such a strong statement about the human heart.&#8217; (Patricia Cornwell)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Terrifying and haunting.&#8217; (Kingsley Amis)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Beautifully written, tragic and provocative.&#8217; (E. M. Forster)</p>
<p>                    ONE OF THE BBC&#8217;S ICONIC &#8216;NOVELS THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD&#8217;</p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Every real human being should read this &#8230; This is what we are.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s brilliant, it&#8217;s captivating, it&#8217;s thought provoking and brutal and for some, its truly terrifying.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;There is a reason why this is studied at school &#8230; Excellent read.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is one of the few books I&#8217;ve read that I keep on my Kindle to read again.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I revisit this every few years and it&#8217;s always fresh and impressive &#8230; One of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brought to you by Penguin.     </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for Audiobook of the Year at the British Book Awards 2020.    </p>
<p>                    Winner of Best Solo Narration at the New York Festival Radio Awards 2020    </p>
<p>                    It is twenty years since the events of La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One unfolded and saw the baby Lyra Belacqua begin her life-changing journey.     </p>
<p>                    It is almost ten years since readers left Lyra and the love of her young life, Will Parry, on a park bench in Oxford&#8217;s Botanic Gardens at the end of the ground-breaking, bestselling His Dark Materials sequence.     </p>
<p>                    Now, in The Secret Commonwealth, we meet Lyra Silvertongue. And she is no longer a child . . .    </p>
<p>                    The second volume of Philip Pullman&#8217;s The Book of Dust sees Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed. Pulled along on his own journey too is Malcolm; once a boy with a boat and a mission to save a baby from the flood, now a man with a strong sense of duty and a desire to do what is right.    </p>
<p>                    Theirs is a world at once familiar and extraordinary, and they must travel far beyond the edges of Oxford, across Europe and into Asia, in search for what is lost &#8211; a city haunted by daemons, a secret at the heart of a desert, and the mystery of the elusive Dust.    </p>
<p>                    The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself, to grow up and make sense of the world around you. This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Michael Sheen throws himself wholeheartedly into narrating this sequel to La Belle Sauvage and listeners will be rapt. For the ever-expanding international cast of characters, Sheen conjures a multitude of accents and delivers rapid-fire conversations between them. He&#8217;s in step with the text at every turn; when situations become fraught or dangerous, Sheen ramps up the tension exquisitely. Thanks to Pullman&#8217;s intricate storytelling and Sheen&#8217;s propulsive narration, listeners will be on the edge of their seats right up to the cliff-hanger ending&#8221; AudioFile</p>
