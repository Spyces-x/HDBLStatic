										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1956 Sarah Dewhurst&#8217;s father shocks her by hiring a dragon to work the farm. The dragon is a smaller blue rather than the traditional larger reds, though even the reds are now scarce. When the blue dragon, Kazimir, unexpectedly saves Sarah and her friend Jason Inagawa from the attentions of the racist police deputy, Kelby, everything changes. Sarah is part of a prophecy and she must escape the clutches of Malcolm, an assassin from a Believer Cell, the dragon-worshiping cult. When Sarah, Malcolm and Kazimir eventually converge, they are thrown into another universe, where dragons seem never to have existed. Can they save this world and the one they left?    </p>

<p>                              In The Vile Village the siblings face such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe cell, and some very strange hats.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series &#8211; set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>                    Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in  their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother,  Gaea. Her giants have risen &#8211; all of them &#8211; and they&#8217;re stronger than ever. </p>
<p>                    They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods  sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus &#8211; in order to  wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp  Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost  within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to  Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs  back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps.  The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.</p>
<p>                    The gods, still  suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of  young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea&#8217;s army of powerful giants? As  dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have  sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over&#8230;</p>
<p>                            Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Austere Academy the siblings face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E. and the metric system.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All The Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

<p>                                In The Wide Window the siblings encounter a hurricane, a signalling device, hungry leaches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain and a doll named Pretty Penny.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

<p>                    Based on an original new story by J.K. Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany, a new play by Jack Thorne, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is the eighth story in the Harry Potter series and the first official Harry Potter story to be presented on stage. The play will receive its world premiere in London’s West End on 30th July 2016. It was always difficult being Harry Potter and it isn’t much easier now that he is an overworked employee of the Ministry of Magic, a husband, and father of three school-age children. While Harry grapples with a past that refuses to stay where it belongs, his youngest son Albus must struggle with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted. As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes, darkness comes from unexpected places.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**Don&#8217;t miss the second series of His Dark Materials on BBC One this November.**</p>
<p>                    From the author of the phenomenal His Dark Materials comes the next chapter in the story of Lyra Silvertongue . . .</p>
<p>                     Lyra is now studying at St Sophia&#8217;s College, Oxford, with her daemon Pantalaimon. </p>
<p>                     But, for the first time there are serious divisions between the two.<br />
                    Lyra is questioning everything she once held dear. Pan misses the impulsiveness of their youth. </p>
<p>                     When an act of terrible violence breaks the peace of the Oxford night, Lyra and Pan&#8217;s relationship reaches a crisis and they are drawn, far from home, into the dangerous factions of a world they had no idea existed.</p>
<p>                     The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself and to grow up and make sense of the world around you. </p>
<p>                    This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.</p>
<p>                    *Exclusive to the paperback edition, Chris Wormell&#8217;s new original illustrations bring Lyra&#8217;s world vividly to life.*<br />
                     _____</p>
<p>                     Reviews for The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two:</p>
<p>                     &#8220;[Pullman] has created a fantasy world, made yet more satisfying in rigour and stylistic elegance. This is a book for getting older with&#8221; Guardian, Book of the Week</p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Secret Commonwealth is ablaze with light and life. The writing is exquisite; every sentence sings &#8230; To read Pullman is to experience the world refreshed, aglow, in Technicolour&#8221; i</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman&#8217;s story is still thought-provoking &#8230; This book elegantly weaves in live issues, from Europe&#8217;s refugee crisis to facts in the post-truth era. And Pullman&#8217;s prose is rewarding as ever&#8221; The Times</p>
<p>                     &#8220;A long, taxing, complex journey, laced with beauty, terror and philosophy&#8221; Metro</p>
<p>                     &#8220;As ever, Pullman&#8217;s story is complex and vast but home to some of the finest storytelling in the 21st century. Revel in whole new worlds and enjoy one of literature&#8217;s most wonderful heroines before she comes to HBO and the BBC&#8221; Stylist</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Pullman is confronting readers with the horrors of our own world reflected back at us. In The Secret Commonwealthhe creates a fearful symmetry&#8221; The Herald</p>

                    The second installment in Rick Riordan&#8217;s blockbuster Norse mythology series has Magnus and friends helping the god of thunder find his missing weapon before all Muspellheim breaks loose.<br />
                    Thor&#8217;s hammer is missing again. The thunder god has a disturbing habit of misplacing his weapon&#8211;the mightiest force in the Nine Worlds. But this time the hammer isn&#8217;t just lost, it has fallen into enemy hands.<br />
                    If Magnus Chase and his friends can&#8217;t retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn.<br />
                    Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer&#8217;s return is the gods&#8217; worst enemy, Loki&#8211;and the price he wants is very high.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Throne of Fire: the second book in Rick Riordan&#8217;s The Kane Chronicles.</p>
<p>                    EVER since the gods of Ancient Egypt were unleashed on the modern world, Carter Kane and his sister, Sadie, have been in big trouble.</p>
<p>                    As descendants of the magical House of Life, they command certain powers. But now a terrifying enemy &#8211; Apophis, the giant snake of chaos &#8211; is rising. </p>
<p>                    If Carter and Sadie don&#8217;t destroy him, the world will end in five days&#8217; time. And in order to battle the forces of chaos, they must revive the sun god Ra &#8211; a feat no magician has ever achieved. Because first they must search the world for the three sections of the Book of Ra, then they have to learn how to chant its spells . . .</p>
<p>                    Can the Kanes destroy Apophis before he swallows the sun and plunges the earth into darkness . . . forever?</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>
<p>                    Praise for the Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Witty and inspired. Gripping, touching and deliciously satirical&#8230;This is most likely to succeed Rowling. Puffin is on to a winner&#8217; &#8211; Amanda Craig, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Puns, jokes and subtle wit, alongside a gripping storyline&#8217; &#8211; Telegraph</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                    The Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    The Lightning Thief; The Sea of Monsters; The Battle of the Labyrinth; The Titan&#8217;s Curse; The Last Olympian </p>
<p>                    Heroes of Olympus:</p>
<p>                    The Lost Hero; The Son of Neptune; The Mark of Athena</p>
<p>                    The Kane Chronicles:</p>
<p>                    The Red Pyramid; The Throne of Fire; The Serpent&#8217;s Shadow</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

As a result, Call has been imprisoned and interrogated.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It began with Eragon . . . It ends with Inheritance.    </p>
<p>                    Not so very long ago, Eragon &#8211; Shadeslayer, Dragon Rider &#8211; was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now, the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.    </p>
<p>                    Long months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.     </p>
<p>                    The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaesia? And if so, at what cost?    </p>
<p>                    Featuring spectacular artwork by cult artist John Jude Palencar, this stunning book brings the bestselling Inheritance cycle to a breathtaking conclusion.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life preservers are mandatory for this wet, wild, and wondrous adventure, the third entry in Rick Riordan&#8217;s New York Times #1 best-selling Norse mythology trilogy, which features a cameo from Percy Jackson.<br />
                    Magnus Chase, a once-homeless teen, is a resident of the Hotel Valhalla and one of Odin&#8217;s chosen warriors. As the son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus isn&#8217;t naturally inclined to fighting. But he has strong and steadfast friends, including Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, and Samirah the Valkyrie, and together they have achieved brave deeds, such as defeating Fenris Wolf and battling giants for Thor&#8217;s hammer, Mjolnir. Now Magnus faces his most dangerous trial yet. His cousin, Annabeth, recruits her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, to give Magnus some pointers, but will his training be enough?<br />
                    Loki is free from his chains. He&#8217;s readying Naglfar, the Ship of the Dead, complete with a host of giants and zombies, to sail against the Asgardian gods and begin the final battle of Ragnarok. It&#8217;s up to Magnus and his friends to stop him, but to do so they will have to sail across the oceans of Midgard, Jotunheim, and Niflheim in a desperate race to reach Naglfar before it&#8217;s ready to sail.<br />
                    Along the way, they will face angry sea gods, hostile giants, and an evil fire-breathing dragon. Magnus&#8217;s biggest challenge will be facing his own inner demons. Does he have what it takes to outwit the wily trickster god?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to an awful camp orientation video created by the god Apollo, Percy Jackson and other residents of Camp Half-Blood answer such questions as What is this place? and Do I get to keep the T-shirt? Newbies can check out the section on the Divine Cabins, read up on Magical Landmarks, and consult the chapter of Training Arenas.<br />
                    But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there. For instance, campers do not always co-exist in peace and harmony. The camp is not run with superior efficiency. Prophecies do not flow forth with great regularity.<br />
                    Sprinkled throughout are stories from heroes who have called Camp Half-Blood home or just passed through on their way to places unknown. Chiron himself introduces the book with a brief history of training based on his millennia of experience. And, of course, there are divine words of wisdom from the god Apollo himself, because . . . well, because the demigod authors would prefer not to be struck down, thank you very much.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back From the Dead     </p>
<p>                     Jason Chaser&#8217;s survival of the horrific &#8212; and suspicious &#8212; crash in the Italian Run was nothing short of a miracle, but it&#8217;s going to take more miracles to salvage his budding racing career. Only the top four students at the International Race School will qualify to compete in the New York Masters, the most prestigious race on the pro circuit, and the accident has cost Jason more than precious points in the standings.     </p>
<p>                     It&#8217;s also undermined his confidence, and Jason&#8217;s rivals are more than willing to take advantage of his weakness to knock him out of the running. Jason will have to outthink as well as outrace the competition to get to New York &#8212; and the toughest race of his life.    </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    I look like a normal kid. Only there&#8217;s a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me. </p>
<p>                    Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball. </p>
<p>                    This time, we&#8217;re under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we&#8217;ll be invaded by monsters. Big ones. </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />

                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>

The one who showed her the truth of her past and &#8230; hopefully her future.Now it&#8217;s just time for them to live happily ever after. Only the gods have different plans. And with Atlantis rising, Maddi isn&#8217;t sure she&#8217;ll survive long enough to even finish her second year, let alone have any sort of future. Even worse, the sadistic Atlantean gods want to break her before they kill her. But Maddi has been underestimated before, and she has hidden strengths they&#8217;ll never see coming. Year of purple &#8230; bring it on. This is book two in the Supernatural Academy series. Full length at 105k words.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life in the magical mess of the Detroit Free Zone is never easy. When you&#8217;re laboring under the curse of a certain prideful, overbearing dragon, it can be down right impossible.    </p>
<p>                    My name is Opal Yong-ae, and I&#8217;m a Cleaner. At least, I used to be. Thanks to the supernatural bad luck that turns everything I do against me, these days I&#8217;m more of a walking disaster. Getting rid of this curse is the only way to get my life back. Unfortunately, dragon magic is every bit as sneaky and deadly as the monsters behind it, and just as hard to beat.    </p>
<p>                    But I&#8217;ve never been one to take her doom at face value. Cornered doesn&#8217;t mean defeated, and in an awakened city that rules herself, dragons are no longer the biggest powers around.    </p>

<p>                    The battle for Camp Jupiter is over. New Rome is safe. Tarquin and his army of the undead have been defeated. Somehow Apollo has made it out alive, with a little bit of help from the Hunters of Artemis.    </p>
<p>                    But though the battle may have been won, the war is far from over.    </p>
<p>                    Now Apollo and Meg must get ready for the final &#8211; and, let&#8217;s face it, probably fatal &#8211; adventure. They must face the last emperor, the terrifying Nero, and destroy him once and for all.    </p>
<p>                    Can Apollo find his godly form again? Will Meg be able to face up to her troubled past? Destiny awaits . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?&#8217; said Ron incredulously. &#8216;You&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8217; (From Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows)  Published by the charity Lumos in association with Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is the first new book from J. K. Rowling since the publication of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The Tales of Beedle the Bard played a crucial role in assisting Harry, with his friends Ron and Hermione, to finally defeat Lord Voldemort. Fans will be thrilled to have this opportunity to read the tales in full. An exciting addition to the canon of Harry Potter, the tales reveal the wonderful versatility of the author, as she tackles with relish the structure and varying tones of a classic fairy tale. There are five tales: &#8216;The Tale of the Three Brothers&#8217;, recounted in Deathly Hallows, plus &#8216;The Fountain of Fair Fortune&#8217;, &#8216;The Warlock&#8217;s Hairy Heart&#8217;, &#8216;The Wizard and the Hopping Pot&#8217;, and &#8216;Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump&#8217;. Each has its own magical character and will bring delight, laughter and the thrill of mortal peril.<br />
                    Translated from the original runes by Hermione Granger, the tales are introduced and illustrated by J. K. Rowling. Also included are notes by Professor Albus Dumbledore, which appear by kind permission of the Hogwarts Headmasters&#8217; Archive.  Lumos is a charity founded by J. K. Rowling which aims to make life better for disadvantaged children. Registered Charity Number: 1112575.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dark epic fantasy inspired by The Prince and the Pauper and the fairy tale The False Prince, from bestselling author C. J. Redwine. Perfect for fans of the Court of Thorns and Roses series and the Wrath and the Dawn duology, The Traitor Prince is a thrilling new standalone novel in the Ravenspire series.    </p>
<p>                    Javan Najafai, crown prince of Akram, has spent the last ten years at an elite boarding school, far away from his kingdom. But his eagerly awaited return home is cut short when a mysterious impostor takes his place&#8211;and no one believes Javan is the true prince.    </p>
<p>                    After barely escaping the impostor&#8217;s assassins, Javan is thrown into Maqbara, the kingdom&#8217;s most dangerous prison. The only way to gain an audience with the king&#8211;and reveal Javan&#8217;s identity&#8211;is to fight in Maqbara&#8217;s yearly tournament. But winning is much harder than acing competitions at school, and soon Javan finds himself beset not just by the terrifying creatures in the arena but also by a band of prisoners allied against him, and even by the warden herself.    </p>
<p>                    The only person who can help him is Sajda, who has been enslaved by Maqbara&#8217;s warden since she was a child, and whose guarded demeanor and powerful right hook keep the prisoners in check. Working with Sajda might be the only way Javan can escape alive&#8211;but she has dangerous secrets.    </p>
<p>                    Together, Javan and Sajda have to outwit the vicious warden, outfight deadly creatures, and outlast the murderous prisoners intent on killing Javan. If they fail, they&#8217;ll be trapped in Maqbara for good&#8211;and the secret Sajda&#8217;s been hiding will bury them both.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestselling dark epic fantasy inspired by the tale of Snow White, from C. J. Redwine, the author of the Defiance series. This breathtakingly romantic, action-packed fantasy is perfect for fans of A Court of Thorns and Roses and Cinder.     </p>
<p>                    Lorelai Diederich, crown princess and fugitive at large, has one mission: kill the wicked queen who took both the Ravenspire throne and the life of her father. To do that, Lorelai needs to use the one weapon she and Queen Irina have in common&#8211;magic. She&#8217;ll have to be stronger, faster, and more powerful than Irina, the most dangerous sorceress Ravenspire has ever seen.    </p>
<p>                    In the neighboring kingdom of Eldr, when Prince Kol&#8217;s father and older brother are killed by an invading army of magic-wielding ogres, the second-born prince is suddenly given the responsibility of saving his kingdom. To do that, Kol needs magic of his own&#8211;and the only way to get it is to make a deal with the queen of Ravenspire, promise to become her personal huntsman&#8211;and bring her Lorelai&#8217;s heart.    </p>
<p>                    But Lorelai is nothing like Kol expected&#8211;beautiful, fierce, and unstoppable&#8211;and despite dark magic, Lorelai is drawn in by the passionate and troubled king. Fighting to stay one step ahead of the dragon huntsman&#8211;who she likes far more than she should&#8211;Lorelai does everything in her power to ruin the wicked queen. But Irina isn&#8217;t going down without a fight, and her final move may cost the princess the one thing she still has left to lose.</p>

Juntos somos mucho más fuertes, pero pronto tuvimos que separarnos para encontrar a los demás&#8230; Yo me fui a España a buscar a Siete y encontré mucho más, descubrí a un décimo miembro de la Guardia que había escapado de Lorien con vida: Ella. Es más joven que nosotros, pero tan valiente como cualquiera. Ahora buscamos a los otros, incluido a John. Sin embargo, ellos también nos buscan. Atraparon al número uno en Malasia. Al número dos en Inglaterra. Al número tres en Kenia. A mí me atraparon en Nueva York, pero escapé. Soy el número seis. Ellos quieren acabar lo que empezaron. Pero primero tendrán que enfrentarse a nosotros.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Pyramid: the first book in Rick Riordan&#8217;s The Kane Chronicles.</p>
<p>                    Percy Jackson fought Greek Gods. Now the Gods of Egypt are waking in the modern world&#8230;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I GUESS IT STARTED THE NIGHT OUR DAD BLEW UP THE BRITISH MUSEUM . . .&#8217;</p>
<p>                    CARTER AND SADIE KANE&#8217;S dad is a brilliant Egyptologist with a secret plan that goes horribly wrong. An explosion shatters the ancient Rosetta stone and unleashes Set, the evil god of chaos . . .</p>
<p>                    Set imprisons Dr Kane in a golden coffin and Carter and Sadie must run for their lives. To save their dad, they embark on a terrifying quest from Cairo to Paris to the American South-west and discover the truth about their family&#8217;s connection to the House of Life: an Egyptian temple of magic that has existed for thousands of years.</p>
<p>                    The pharaohs of ancient Egypt are far from dead and buried. And neither, unfortunately, are their gods . . .</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Witty and inspired. Gripping, touching and deliciously satirical&#8230;This is most likely to succeed Rowling. Puffin is on to a winner&#8217; &#8211; Amanda Craig, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Puns, jokes and subtle wit, alongside a gripping storyline&#8217; &#8211; Telegraph</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan is an award-winning mystery writer. He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was the overall winner of the Red House Children&#8217;s Book Award in 2006.</p>
<p>                    The Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    The Lightning Thief; The Sea of Monsters; The Battle of the Labyrinth; The Titan&#8217;s Curse; The Last Olympian </p>
<p>                    Heroes of Olympus:</p>
<p>                    The Lost Hero; The Son of Neptune; The Mark of Athena</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dematr is a world ruled by the diametrically opposed Mage and Mechanic Guilds. For centuries, the two Great Guilds have been bitter rivals. But now a Storm approaches, one that could sweep away everything that humans have built. Only one person has any chance of uniting enough of the world behind to stop the Storm. Mari is a brilliant young Mechanic, just out of the Guild Halls, where she has spent most of her life learning how to run the steam locomotives and other devices of her Guild. Alain is the youngest Mage ever to learn how to change the world he sees with the power of his mind. Each has been taught that the works of the other&#8217;s Guild are frauds. But when their caravan is destroyed, they must join forces. Their union could save the world from the approaching Storm, but it could also upend the Great Guilds who will stop at nothing to preserve their power. Mari and Alain will have to choose between protecting their lives and their Guilds, or risking everything to protect Dematr from the coming Storm.</p>

<p>                    Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave may hold answers. </p>

<p>                    Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame.</p>
<p>                    To stay alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brought to you by Penguin.     </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for Audiobook of the Year at the British Book Awards 2020.    </p>
<p>                    Winner of Best Solo Narration at the New York Festival Radio Awards 2020    </p>
<p>                    It is twenty years since the events of La Belle Sauvage: The Book of Dust Volume One unfolded and saw the baby Lyra Belacqua begin her life-changing journey.     </p>
<p>                    It is almost ten years since readers left Lyra and the love of her young life, Will Parry, on a park bench in Oxford&#8217;s Botanic Gardens at the end of the ground-breaking, bestselling His Dark Materials sequence.     </p>
<p>                    Now, in The Secret Commonwealth, we meet Lyra Silvertongue. And she is no longer a child . . .    </p>
<p>                    The second volume of Philip Pullman&#8217;s The Book of Dust sees Lyra, now twenty years old, and her daemon Pantalaimon, forced to navigate their relationship in a way they could never have imagined, and drawn into the complex and dangerous factions of a world that they had no idea existed. Pulled along on his own journey too is Malcolm; once a boy with a boat and a mission to save a baby from the flood, now a man with a strong sense of duty and a desire to do what is right.    </p>
<p>                    Theirs is a world at once familiar and extraordinary, and they must travel far beyond the edges of Oxford, across Europe and into Asia, in search for what is lost &#8211; a city haunted by daemons, a secret at the heart of a desert, and the mystery of the elusive Dust.    </p>
<p>                    The Secret Commonwealth is truly a book for our times; a powerful adventure and a thought-provoking look at what it is to understand yourself, to grow up and make sense of the world around you. This is storytelling at its very best from one of our greatest writers.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Michael Sheen throws himself wholeheartedly into narrating this sequel to La Belle Sauvage and listeners will be rapt. For the ever-expanding international cast of characters, Sheen conjures a multitude of accents and delivers rapid-fire conversations between them. He&#8217;s in step with the text at every turn; when situations become fraught or dangerous, Sheen ramps up the tension exquisitely. Thanks to Pullman&#8217;s intricate storytelling and Sheen&#8217;s propulsive narration, listeners will be on the edge of their seats right up to the cliff-hanger ending&#8221; AudioFile</p>

<p>                    Now with a stunning new cover and exclusive bonus material: Nikolai Lantsov character art and a Q&#038;A with Leigh Bardugo.</p>
<p>                    Soldier. Summoner. Saint.  Alina Starkov&#8217;s power has grown, but not without a price. She is the  Sun Summoner &#8211; hunted across the True Sea, haunted by the lives she took  on the Shadow Fold. But she and Mal can&#8217;t outrun their enemies for  long.</p>
<p>                    The Darkling is more determined than ever to claim Alina&#8217;s  magic and use it to take the Ravkan throne. With nowhere else to turn,  Alina enlists the help of an infamous privateer and sets out to lead the  Grisha army.</p>
<p>                    But as the truth of Alina&#8217;s destiny unfolds, she  slips deeper into the Darkling&#8217;s deadly game of forbidden magic, and  further away from her humanity. To save her country, Alina will have to  choose between her power and the love she thought would always be her  shelter. No victory can come without sacrifice &#8211; and only she can face  the oncoming storm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books 1-8 of the New York Times bestselling Magic Tree House series plus an interview with Mary Pope Osborne!</p>
<p>                    Meet Jack and Annie!</p>
<p>                    Jack and his younger sister, Annie, are just regular kids. But when they discover a tree house in the woods, something magical happens. In books 1-4, Jack and Annie are whisked back in time to the Age of Dinosaurs, a medieval castle, ancient pyramids, and treasure-seeking pirates. In books 5-8, Jack and Annie&#8217;s friend, Morgan le Fay, is in trouble! They must find four M things to free her from a spell. Their adventures take them to meet a ninja master in ancient Japan, flee a crocodile on the Amazon River, discover the cave people of the Ice Age, and blast off to the moon in the future. It&#8217;s a difficult and dangerous mission, but Jack and Annie will do anything to save a friend! </p>
<p>                    Audiobooks in this set include: Dinosaurs Before Dark (#1), The Knight at Dawn (#2), Mummies in the Morning (#3), Pirates Past Noon (#4), Night of the Ninjas (#5), Afternoon on the Amazon (#6), Sunset of the Sabertooth (#7), and Midnight on the Moon (#8). </p>
<p>                    Mary Pope Osborne brings together just the right combination of history, magic, and fast-paced adventure to satisfy kids, parents, teachers, and librarians all over the world with her New York Times bestselling series. </p>
<p>                    Osborne&#8217;s narration is low-key and well-paced. A great way to introduce children who are reluctant readers or can&#8217;t yet read to this highly entertaining book series and to reading in general.&#8211;Chicago Parent</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Osborne&#8217;s soothing, beautifully articulated voice and knack for characterization are reliably pleasing.&#8211;AudioFile</p>

<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>
