										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the last 25 years, Jim Kwik has helped everyone from celebrities to CEOs to students improve their memory, increase their decision-making skills, learn to speed-read and unleash their superbrains.    </p>

They&#8217;ll learn how to supercharge their brains with simple, actionable tools to sharpen the mind, enhance focus and fast-track their fullest potential.    </p>
<p>                    The book is organized into four sections: Mindset, Motivation, Meta-Learning and Mission. Readers will discover the myths they&#8217;ve been told about their IQ, abilities and skillset; understand why learning matters; learn core habits and steps to becoming limitless; and explore how they can serve the world. They&#8217;ll also learn how to conquer the four supervillains: Distraction, Digital Dementia, Digital Deluge and Depression.    </p>
<p>                    Believing that you are limited is holding you back from achieving your biggest dreams. But we all have superpowers inside of us, and the key to activating those superpowers is unlimiting yourself.    </p>
