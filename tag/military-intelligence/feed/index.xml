										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if you could combine the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization?    </p>
<p>                    When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Iraq in 2003, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment and training &#8211; but none of the enemy&#8217;s speed and flexibility.    </p>
<p>                    McChrystal and his colleagues discarded a century of conventional wisdom to create a &#8216;team of teams&#8217; that combined extremely transparent communication with decentralized decision-making authority.     </p>
<p>                    Faster, flatter and more flexible, the task force beat back al-Qaeda.    </p>
<p>                    In this powerful book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be relevant to any leader. Through compelling examples, the authors demonstrate that the &#8216;team of teams&#8217; strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency rooms to NASA and has the potential to transform organizations large and small.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A bold argument that leaders can help teams become greater than the sum of their parts&#8217; Charles Duhigg, author of The Power of Habit    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An indispensable guide to organizational change&#8217; Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs</p>
