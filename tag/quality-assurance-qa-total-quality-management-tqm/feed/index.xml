										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scaling up excellence is the key to creating a great organisation. It&#8217;s how a small enterprise expands without losing focus. It&#8217;s how a brilliant new idea or plan developed by the few goes on to be adopted by the many. And, in hard times and tough situations, it&#8217;s how pockets of smart new thinking overcome cultures of indifference  or negativity. An organisation that doesn&#8217;t know how to scale up what is best within it won&#8217;t achieve long-term success.     </p>
<p>                    Bestselling author Robert Sutton and his Stanford colleague Huggy Rao have devoted nearly a decade to uncovering what it takes to create and spread outstanding performance, and in Scaling Up Excellence they share the fruits of their research. Drawing on case studies that range from Silicon Valley enterprises to non-profit organisations, they provide crucial insights into corporate cultures, both good and bad, and offer a road map for establishing and stimulating excellence. In the process, they show how to use &#8216;premortems&#8217; when making big decisions about change. They reveal why seven is so often the magic number when it comes to team size. They examine successful and unsuccessful quests for improvement &#8211; in hospitals, schools and elsewhere. And they discuss when a single corporate mindset is best (&#8216;Catholicism&#8217;) and when local variation is preferable (&#8216;Buddhism&#8217;).     </p>
<p>                    Scaling Up Excellence is the first management book devoted to what is  &#8211; or should be  &#8211;  a core priority for every organisation. As such it is destined to become the standard bearer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day &#8212; as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?     </p>
<p>                    Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.</p>
