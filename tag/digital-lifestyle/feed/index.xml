										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FINALIST &#8211; Business Book Awards 2019 &#8211; Embracing Change Category    </p>
<p>                    Brands are built on trust, but in a post-truth world they&#8217;re faced with a serious challenge: so much of modern life is defined by mistrust. A shattering of the vital trust connection between brands and consumers, together with the evaporation of authenticity as a core brand pillar, is causing enormous problems for businesses on a global scale. If a brand isn&#8217;t seen as trustworthy, then when choice is available it will be rejected in favour of one that is.    </p>
<p>                    The Post-Truth Business provides a way forward for any organization wishing to rebuild brand authenticity in a distrustful world. It explains the interconnected problems facing businesses, with important topics including:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; The impact of fake news, disinformation and the weaponizing of lies<br />
                    &#8211; The safeguarding of privacy, alongside privacy as a tradable asset<br />
                    &#8211; Why and how brands must create communication with meaning<br />
                    &#8211; The dangers of inauthentic cultural marketing activities<br />
                    &#8211; Examples of conscious capitalism and brand activism<br />
                    &#8211; Lessons in authenticity from artisans and innovators<br />
                    &#8211; National branding and reputation capital<br />
                    &#8211; Leveraging the power of &#8216;brand trust&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    The Post-Truth Business shows how to strengthen consumer engagement by closing the &#8216;brand credibility gap&#8217;. It&#8217;s packed with examples of inspiring people, brands and international campaigns from the fashion, beauty, outdoor, motor, drinks, finance, media, technology, entertainment and health sectors. Each of them demonstrates a dynamic and positive way forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wikipedia&#8217;s first twenty years: how what began as an experiment in collaboration became the world&#8217;s most popular reference work.    </p>
<p>                    We have been looking things up in Wikipedia for twenty years. What began almost by accident&#8211;a wiki attached to an nascent online encyclopedia&#8211;has become the world&#8217;s most popular reference work. Regarded at first as the scholarly equivalent of a Big Mac, Wikipedia is now known for its reliable sourcing and as a bastion of (mostly) reasoned interaction. How has Wikipedia, built on a model of radical collaboration, remained true to its original mission of &#8220;free access to the sum of all human knowledge&#8221; when other tech phenomena have devolved into advertising platforms? In this book, scholars, activists, and volunteers reflect on Wikipedia&#8217;s first twenty years, revealing connections across disciplines and borders, languages and data, the professional and personal.    </p>
<p>                    The contributors consider Wikipedia&#8217;s history, the richness of the connections that underpin it, and its founding vision. Their essays look at, among other things, the shift from bewilderment to respect in press coverage of Wikipedia; Wikipedia as &#8220;the most important laboratory for social scientific and computing research in history&#8221;; and the acknowledgment that &#8220;free access&#8221; includes not just access to the material but freedom to contribute&#8211;that the summation of all human knowledge is biased by who documents it.    </p>
<p>                    Contributors    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joan Didion at a startup&#8217; Rebecca Solnit    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;Impossibly pleasurable&#8217; Jia Tolentino    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;This is essential reading&#8217; Stylist    </p>
<p>                              At twenty-five years old, Anna Wiener was beginning to tire of her assistant job in New York publishing. There was no room to grow, and the voyeuristic thrill of answering someone else&#8217;s phone had worn thin.    </p>
<p>                              Within a year she had moved to Silicon Valley to take up a job at a data analytics startup in San Francisco. Leaving her business casual skirts and shirts in the wardrobe, she began working in company-branded T-shirts. She had a healthy income for the first time in her life. She felt like part of the future.    </p>
<p>                              But a tide was beginning to turn. People were speaking of tech startups as surveillance companies. Out of sixty employees, only eight of her colleagues were women. Casual sexism was rife. Sexual harassment cases were proliferating. And soon, like everyone else, she was addicted to the internet, refreshing the news, refreshing social media, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. Slowly, she began to realise that her blind faith in ambitious, arrogant young men from America&#8217;s soft suburbs wasn&#8217;t just her own personal pathology. It had become a global affliction.    </p>
<p>                              Uncanny Valley is a coming of age story set against the backdrop of our generation&#8217;s very own gold rush. It&#8217;s a story about the tension between old and new, between art and tech, between the quest for money and the quest for meaning &#8211; about how our world is changing forever.</p>

<p>                    In sharply argued, fast-moving chapters, Cory Doctorow&#8217;s Information Doesn&#8217;t Want to Be Free takes on the state of copyright and creative success in the digital age. Can small artists still thrive in the Internet era? Can giant record labels avoid alienating their audiences? This is a book about the pitfalls, and the opportunities, creative industries (and individuals) are confronting today&#8211;about how the old models have failed or found new footing, and about what might soon replace them. An essential read for anyone with a stake in the future of the arts, Information Doesn&#8217;t Want to Be Free offers a vivid guide to the ways creativity and the Internet interact today, and to what might be coming next.</p>
