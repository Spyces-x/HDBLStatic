										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first-person account of a 26-year-old who fought in the war in Sierra Leone as a 12-year-old boy.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;My new friends have begun to suspect that I haven&#8217;t told them the full story of my life.<br />
                    &#8220;Why did you leave Sierra Leone?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Because there is a war.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;You mean, you saw people running around with guns and shooting each other?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Yes, all the time.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Cool.&#8221;<br />
                    I smile a little.<br />
                    &#8220;You should tell us about it sometime.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;Yes, sometime.&#8221;&#8216;    </p>
<p>                              This is how wars are fought now: by children, hopped-up on drugs and wielding AK-47s. There are more than fifty conflicts going on worldwide and it is estimated there are some 300,000 child soldiers fighting. Ishmael Beah used to be one of them.    </p>
<p>                              What is war like through the eyes of a child soldier? How does one become a killer? How does one stop? Child soldiers have been profiled by journalists, and novelists have struggled to imagine their lives. But until now, there has not been a first-person account from someone who came through this hell and survived. Ishmael Beah, now twenty-five years old, tells a riveting story: how at the age of twelve in Sierra Leone, he fled attacking rebels and wandered a land rendered unrecognizable by violence. By thirteen, he&#8217;d been picked up by the government army, and Beah, at heart a gentle boy, found he was capable of truly terrible acts.    </p>
<p>                              This is a rare and mesmerizing account, told with real literary force and heartbreaking honesty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WINNER OF THE ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL WRITING 2019<br />
                              A BARACK OBAMA BEST BOOK OF 2019<br />
                              SHORTLISTED FOR THE NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FOR NONFICTION 2019<br />
                              TIME&#8217;s #1 Best Nonfiction Book of 2019<br />
                              A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<br />
                              &#8216;A must read&#8217; Gillian Flynn<br />
                              One night in December 1972, Jean McConville, a mother of ten, was abducted from her home in Belfast and never seen alive again. Her disappearance would haunt her orphaned children, the perpetrators of the brutal crime and a whole society in Northern Ireland for decades.    </p>
<p>                              Through the unsolved case of Jean McConville&#8217;s abduction, Patrick Radden Keefe tells the larger story of the Troubles, investigating Dolours Price, the first woman to join the IRA, who bombed the Old Bailey; Gerry Adams, the politician who helped end the fighting but denied his IRA past; and Brendan Hughes, an IRA commander who broke their code of silence. A gripping story forensically reported, Say Nothing explores the extremes people will go to for an ideal, and the way societies mend &#8211; or don&#8217;t &#8211; after long and bloody conflict.    </p>
