										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Break the rules, not the fast with world-renowned biohacker and New York Times bestselling author Dave Asprey.</p>
<p>                              For more than a decade, the Bulletproof founder Dave Asprey has shared his unique point of view and expertise to help fans become the best versions of themselves. From living longer to getting smarter, maximising performance to practising mindfulness, Dave&#8217;s followers look to him for his take on the most effective techniques to become healthier and more powerful than most doctors think is possible.</p>
<p>                              Asprey has been fasting for years, long before it gained widespread popularity, and if you&#8217;re a fan of The Bulletproof Diet, you have been enjoying some of the benefits of Intermittent Fasting too.</p>
<p>                              In Fast This Way, Dave asks readers to forget everything they think they know about the ancient practice and takes them on a journey through cutting-edge science to examine the ways novice fasters and Intermittent Fasting loyalists can up-end their relationship with food and upgrade their fasting game beyond calorie restriction.  </p>
<p>                     What IF eating the right foods at the right time can actually enhance your fast?<br />
                     What IF how you work out and sleep could trick your body into thinking you are fasting?<br />
                     What IF it were easy to skip a meal, or two, or three?<br />
                     What IF fasting is different for women, can be personalised to your genes, and can impact your mental health?<br />
                     What IF all fasts could be created equal?</p>
<p>                              Fast This Way is a compelling read through the latest thinking on fasting and gives readers the manual and toolkit to make the most of their fasts and their personal biology.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unforgettable&#8217; The Times &#8216;Grippingly told and brilliantly reported&#8217; Mail on Sunday &#8216;Startlingly intimate&#8217; Sunday Times &#8216;Fascinating&#8217; Daily Mail &#8216;Groundbreaking&#8217; Evening Standard &#8216;Exceptional and moving&#8217; Spectator &#8216;Hidden Valley Road contains everything: scientific intrigue, meticulous reporting, startling revelations, and, most of all, a profound sense of humanity. It is that rare book that can be read again and again.&#8217; -David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon One of the New York Times&#8217; &#8217;20 most anticipated books of 2020&#8242;: the heartrending story of a mid-century American family with twelve children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became science&#8217;s great hope in the quest to understand the disease. &#8216;An extraordinary case study and tour de force of reporting.&#8217; -Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don&#8217;s work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins &#8211; aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony &#8211; and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after the other, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institutes of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother, to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amidst profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family&#8217;s unforgettable legacy of suffering, love and hope. &#8216;This book tore my heart out. It is a revelation-about the history of mental health treatment, about trauma, foremost about family-and a more-than-worthy follow-up to Robert Kolker&#8217;s brilliant Lost Girls.&#8217; -Megan Abbott, Edgar Award-winning author of Dare Me and Give Me Your Hand</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness is now all the rage. From celebrity endorsements to monks, neuroscientists and meditation coaches rubbing shoulders with CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, it is clear that mindfulness has gone mainstream. Some have even called it a revolution. But what if, instead of changing the world, mindfulness has become a banal form of capitalist spirituality that mindlessly avoids social and political transformation, reinforcing the neoliberal status quo?</p>
<p>                    In McMindfulness, Ronald Purser debunks the so-called &#8220;mindfulness revolution,&#8221; exposing how corporations, schools, governments and the military have coopted it as a technique for social control and<br />
                    self-pacification. </p>
<p>                    A lively and razor-sharp critique, Purser busts the myths its salesmen rely on, challenging the narrative that stress is self-imposed and mindfulness is the cure-all. If we are to harness the truly revolutionary potential of mindfulness, we have to cast off its neoliberal shackles, liberating mindfulness for a collective awakening.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Compelling, haunting, tragic stories  . . . resonate long after you put the book down&#8217; James McConnachie, Sunday Times Book of the Year      </p>
<p>                    The routine traffic stop that ends in tragedy. The spy who spends years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon. The false conviction of Amanda Knox. Why do we so often get other people wrong? Why is it so hard to detect a lie, read a face or judge a stranger&#8217;s motives?    </p>
<p>                    Using stories of deceit and fatal errors to cast doubt on our strategies for dealing with the unknown, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual adventure into the darker side of human nature, where strangers are never simple and misreading them can have disastrous consequences.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dark Psychology Series Complete 3 Book Compilation    </p>
<p>                    This book includes: How to Analyze People: Dark Psychology &#8211; Dark Secrets to Analyze and Influence Anyone Using Body Language, Human Psychology, Subliminal Persuasion and NLP<br />
                    Persuasion: Dark Psychology &#8211; How People are Influencing You to Do What They Want Using Manipulation, NLP, and Subliminal Persuasion<br />
                    Dark Psychology: The Practical Uses and Best Defenses of Psychological Warfare in Everyday Life &#8211; How to Detect and Defend Against Manipulation, Deception, Dark Persuasion, and Covert NLP    </p>
<p>                    If you&#8217;re tired of being manipulated, whether you&#8217;re being tricked into doing things you don&#8217;t want, or others are taking advantage of you, there are ways to stop manipulation and persuasion in its tracks.    </p>
<p>                    In this book, you will get a groundwork for what different types of persuasion and manipulation might be. You will learn the process of how people use these tactics to their advantage.    </p>
<p>                    The first half of the book will discuss what makes up an individual. The way you use your body, the words that you choose to speak, and the way that they were raised all play important roles in what makes an individual. You will also have to look at your own self and pick out all of these unique things that make them different from everyone else as well.    </p>
<p>                    There are psychological studies that back up the idea of certain methods of persuasion, such as NLP tactics, that prove that anyone has the power to persuade others.    </p>
<p>                    Inside this book, you will discover: WhatDark Psychologyis and how it&#8217;s used to control people.How to plant different emotional seeds that will grow in people&#8217;s mindsHow to use words to steer people however you likeHow to identify and work with different types of people like contrarians and control freaks.The jobs/roles in society that you are most likely to be manipulated inThe language of the subconsciousThedirty trickslovers and family members use to control their victims.How to analyze different personality typesMind-blowing tricks for manipulationMagic words for influencing othersA step-by-step guide on influencing others with NLPForbidden secrets of dark psychologyCase studies showcasing how much damage a master manipulator can do.And much more&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Although there are many differences among people, there are also many things that make us the same. In order to better analyze and understand those around you, it&#8217;s crucial to find those things that we do connect on, and the things that bring us together rather than the things that tear us apart.    </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s important when reading this book to remember that not all manipulation is bad. In the first book of this boxset, it is emphasized that those who might be manipulating you might also be taking advantage of you.    </p>
<p>                    When reading this book, you should remember that manipulation is a tool, much like a hammer. You can either use that hammer to destroy everything around you, or you could alternatively use that hammer to create something organic, something new.    </p>
<p>                    This book will take you first through the discovery and analyzation of those around you, and then it will provide different ways that you can persuade them.    </p>
<p>                    The only thing you need before starting this book is the willingness to change. You might have to confront some of your darkest issues, and you might have to put yourself through future scenarios that elicit a feeling of discomfort. In the end, however, you&#8217;ll find yourself to be much more self-aware and independent.Click &#8220;Add to Cart&#8221; nowand learn how to defend against dark psychology and keep your mind and life in control.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;George helped me understand the art of mindfulness. To be neither distracted or focused, rigid or flexible, passive or aggressive. I learned just to be. &#8211;Kobe Bryant    </p>
<p>                    Michael Jordan credits George Mumford with transforming his on-court leadership of the Bulls, helping Jordan lead the team to six NBA championships. Mumford also helped Kobe Bryant, Andrew Bynum, and Lamar Odom and countless other NBA players turn around their games. A widely respected public speaker and coach, Mumford is sharing his own story and the strategies that have made these athletes into stars in The Mindful Athlete: The Secret to Pure Performance. His proven, gentle but groundbreaking mindfulness techniques can transform the performance of anyone with a goal, be they an Olympian, weekend warrior, executive, hacker, or artist.     </p>
<p>                    When Michael Jordan left the Chicago Bulls to play baseball in 1993, the team was in crisis. Coach Phil Jackson, a long-time mindfulness practitioner, contacted Dr. Kabat-Zinn to find someone who could teach mindfulness techniques to the struggling team&#8211;someone who would have credibility and could speak the language of his players. Kabat-Zinn led Jackson to Mumford and their partnership began. Mumford has worked with Jackson and each of the eleven teams he coached to become NBA champions. His roster of champion clients has since blossomed way beyond basketball to include corporate executives, Olympians, and athletes in many different sports.     </p>
<p>                    With a charismatic teaching style that combines techniques of engaged mindfulness with lessons from popular culture icons such as Yoda, Indiana Jones, and Bruce Lee, Mumford tells illuminating stories about his larger than life clients. His writing is down-to-earth and easy to understand and apply. The Mindful Athlete is an engrossing story and an invaluable resource for anyone looking to elevate their game, no matter what the pursuit, and includes a foreword by Phil Jackson.     </p>
<p>                    Self-consciousness is when you&#8217;re focused on how you&#8217;re doing instead of what you&#8217;re doing. We have to learn how to push and challenge ourselves, but not in an insensitive way. Honing your performance really comes down to being comfortable with being uncomfortable.&#8211;George Mumford</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking approach to succeeding in business and life, using the science of resourcefulness.  We often think the key to success and satisfaction is to get more: more money, time, and possessions; bigger budgets, job titles, and teams; and additional resources for our professional and personal goals. It turns out we&#8217;re wrong. Using captivating stories to illustrate research in psychology and management, Rice University professor Scott Sonenshein examines why some people and organizations succeed with so little, while others fail with so much.  People and organizations approach resources in two different ways: &#8220;chasing&#8221; and &#8220;stretching.&#8221; When chasing, we exhaust ourselves in the pursuit of more. When stretching, we embrace the resources we already have. This frees us to find creative and productive ways to solve problems, innovate, and engage our work and lives more fully.  Stretch shows why everyone-from executives to entrepreneurs, professionals to parents, athletes to artists-performs better with constraints; why seeking too many resources undermines our work and well-being; and why even those with a lot benefit from making the most out of a little.<br />
                    Drawing from examples in business, education, sports, medicine, and history, Scott Sonenshein advocates a powerful framework of resourcefulness that allows anybody to work and live better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering neuroscientist argues that we are more than our brains    </p>
<p>                    To many, the brain is the seat of personal identity and autonomy. But the way we talk about the brain is often rooted more in mystical conceptions of the soul than in scientific fact. This blinds us to the physical realities of mental function. We ignore bodily influences on our psychology, from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut, and overlook the ways that the environment affects our behavior, via factors varying from subconscious sights and sounds to the weather. As a result, we alternately overestimate our capacity for free will or equate brains to inorganic machines like computers. But a brain is neither a soul nor an electrical network: it is a bodily organ, and it cannot be separated from its surroundings. Our selves aren&#8217;t just inside our heads&#8211;they&#8217;re spread throughout our bodies and beyond. Only once we come to terms with this can we grasp the true nature of our humanity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acclaimed sports psychologist Bob Rotella has advised everyone from professional golfers to NBA superstars to business executives on how to flourish under pressure and overcome challenges. &#8220;Rotella&#8217;s philosophy is astonishingly simple&#8230;his success rate&#8230;is phenomenal&#8221; (The New York Times). Now, for the first time, he&#8217;s distilled his decades of in-depth research and practical experience into a potential-unlocking guide for everyone, from businesspeople to athletes to parents.<br />
                         Most psychology is focused on trying to make abnormal people normal. Bob Rotella&#8217;s work is to make normal people exceptional. How Champions Think takes readers inside the minds of winners in many fields. It explores how to keep the mind from holding you back, whatever your physical gifts or other talents.

<p>                    Johnson&#8217;s theme is that all of our accomplishments are due to our beliefs: whether we&#8217;re confident or insecure, cynical or positive, open-minded or inflexible. But it&#8217;s difficult to change your beliefs &#8211; and with them, your outcomes. Find out how Hem, Haw, and the other characters from Who Moved My Cheese? deal with this challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavioral economist and New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our general behaviour, up close and personal.    </p>
<p>                              In The Upside of Irrationality, behavioral economist Dan Ariely will explore the many ways in which our behaviour often leads us astray in terms of our romantic relationships, our experiences in the workplace, and our temptations to cheat. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.    </p>
<p>                              Among the topics Dan explores are:<br />
                    * What we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy;<br />
                    * How we learn to love the ones we are with;<br />
                    * Why online dating doesn&#8217;t work, and how we can improve on it;<br />
                    * Why learning more about people make us like them less;<br />
                    * Why large bonuses can make CEOs less productive;<br />
                    * How to really motivate people at work;<br />
                    * Why bad directions can help us;<br />
                    * How we fall in love with our ideas;<br />
                    * How we are motivated by revenge; and<br />
                    * What motivates us to cheat.    </p>
<p>                              Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational such a hit, Dan will emphasize the important role that irrationality plays in our day-to-day decisionmaking-not just in our financial marketplace, but in the most hidden aspects of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blending humor and behavioral economics, the New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational delves into the truly illogical world of personal finance to help people better understand why they make bad financial decisions, and gives them the knowledge they need to make better ones.    </p>
<p>                    Why does paying for things often feel like it causes physical pain?<br />
                    Why does it cost you money to act as your own real estate agent?<br />
                    Why are we comfortable overpaying for something now just because we&#8217;ve overpaid for it before?    </p>
<p>                    In Dollars and Sense, world renowned economist Dan Ariely answers these intriguing questions and many more as he explains how our irrational behavior often interferes with our best intentions when it comes to managing our finances. Partnering with financial comedian and writer Jeff Kreisler, Ariely takes us deep inside our minds to expose the hidden motivations that are secretly driving our choices about money.    </p>
<p>                    Exploring a wide range of everyday topics-from credit card debt and household budgeting to holiday sales-Ariely and Kreisler demonstrate how our ideas about dollars and cents are often wrong and cost us more than we know. Mixing case studies and anecdotes with tangible advice and lessons, they cut through the unconscious fears and desires driving our worst financial instincts and teach us how to improve our money habits.    </p>
<p>                    Fascinating, engaging, funny, and essential, Dollars and Sense is a sound investment, providing us with the practical tools we need to understand and improve our financial choices, save and spend smarter, and ultimately live better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fight back against a modern culture that is rewiring our brains and damaging our health with this practical, doctor-approved plan for healing that includes a ten-day boot camp and forty delicious recipes.<br />
                    Contemporary life provides us with infinite opportunities, along with endless temptations. We can eat whatever we want, whenever we want. We can immerse ourselves in the vast, enticing world of digital media. We can buy goods and services for rapid delivery with our fingertips or voice commands. But living in this 24/7 hyper-reality poses serious risks to our physical and mental states, our connections to others, and even to the world at large.<br />
                    Brain Wash builds from a simple premise: Our brains are being gravely manipulated, resulting in behaviors that leave us more lonely, anxious, depressed, distrustful, illness-prone, and overweight than ever before.<br />
                    Based on the latest science, the book identifies the mental hijacking that undermines each and every one of us, and presents the tools necessary to think more clearly, make better decisions, strengthen bonds with others, and develop healthier habits. Featuring a 10-day bootcamp program, including a meal plan and 40 delicious original recipes, Brain Wash is the key to cultivating a more purposeful and fulfilling life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Future-proof your career and maximize your competitive advantage by learning the skill necessary to stay relevant, reinvent yourself, and adapt to whatever the workplace throws your way in this essential guide.    </p>
<p>                              Faced with tumultuous economic times and rapid technological change, staying ahead in your career depends on continual learning-a lifelong mastery of new ideas, subjects, and skills. If you want to accomplish more and stand apart from everyone else, you need to become an ultralearner.    </p>
<p>                              Scott Young incorporates the latest research about the most effective learning methods and the stories of other ultralearners like himself-among them Ben Franklin, Judit Polgar, and Richard Feynman, as well as a host of others, such as little-known modern polymaths like Nigel Richards who won the World Championship of French Scrabble-without knowing French.    </p>
<p>                              Young documents the methods he and others have used and shows that, far from being an obscure skill limited to aggressive autodidacts, ultralearning is a powerful tool anyone can use to improve their career, studies, and life. Ultralearning explores this fascinating subculture, shares the nine principles behind every successful ultralearning project, and offers insights into how you can organize and execute a plan to learn anything deeply and quickly, without teachers or budget-busting tuition costs.    </p>
<p>                              Whether the goal is to be fluent in a language (or ten languages), earn the equivalent of a college degree in a fraction of the time, or master multiple skills to build a product or business from the ground up, the principles in Ultralearning will guide you to success.</p>

<p>                    Driving is about far more than getting from A to B. As Tom Vanderbilt&#8217;s brilliant, curiosity-filled book shows, it&#8217;s actually the key to deciphering human nature and &#8230; well, pretty much everything. From the etiquette of horn-honking to bumper stickers you should avoid, from gridlock in ancient Rome to why getting rid of road signs actually reduces accidents, Traffic will change the way you see yourself, and other people (and not just through your windscreen).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Raising Cain, Dan Kindlon, Ph.D., and Michael Thompson, Ph.D., two of the country&#8217;s leading child psychologists, share what they have learned in more than thirty-five years of combined experience working with boys and their families. They reveal a nation of boys who are hurting&#8211;sad, afraid, angry, and silent. Kindlon and Thompson set out to answer this basic, crucial question: What do boys need that they&#8217;re not getting? They illuminate the forces that threaten our boys, teaching them to believe that &#8220;cool&#8221; equals macho strength and stoicism. Cutting through outdated theories of &#8220;mother blame,&#8221; &#8220;boy biology,&#8221; and &#8220;testosterone,&#8221; the authors shed light on the destructive emotional training our boys receive&#8211;the emotional miseducation of boys. Kindlon and Thompson make a compelling case that emotional literacy is the most valuable gift we can offer our sons, urging parents to recognize the price boys pay when we hold them to an impossible standard of manhood. They identify the social and emotional challenges that boys encounter in school and show how parents can help boys cultivate emotional awareness and empathy&#8211;giving them the vital connections and support they need to navigate the social pressures of youth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is the ability to creatively tackle problems innate or can it be  learned? Like most human traits, both answers are correct. Some people  are inherently more innovative than others. But, just like maths, or  writing, everyone can improve with practice. Tina Seelig, PhD teaches  creativity every day in her courses on innovation at Stanford School of  Engineering. After ten years of experience, she confidently asserts that  not only can creativity be taught but that there are a clear set of  tools, skills and approaches that can unlock anyone&#8217;s creative  potential.    </p>
<p>                     In InGenius, Seelig reminds us that creativity is not just  something that you think about &#8211; it is something that you do. It is as  natural as breathing, and just as necessary for leading a successful and  fulfilling life. Creative solutions are required because the status quo  is never good enough, and our goal should always be to push beyond the  limits of what seems possible. Great ideas are needed to solve all the  problems we face and to enrich our lives. Whether it is in the  conference room, classroom or kitchen, new ideas open up a world of  wonderful possibilities. With the tools presented in this remarkable book, we will learn how to pull out all stops to take on the  challenges, big and small, that come our way, and to see that every  word, every idea, and every moment provides an opportunity for  creativity that will enhance our lives.    </p>
<p>                    InGenius is filled with concepts, tools, techniques and  stories that reveal ways you can increase your creativity quotient, and  that of your groups and organizations. The first half of the book  focuses on the inside out &#8211; what you can personally do to increase your  own creative aptitude and attitude. The second half deals with the  outside in &#8211; how you can change the local and cultural environment to  increase the creativity quotient of your community.    </p>
<p>                     InGenius reveals one of the great truths about ideas: it costs nothing to generate amazing ideas, and yet the results have  the potential to be priceless.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to make sense of something as elusive as creativity?     </p>
<p>                     Based on psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman&#8217;s groundbreaking research and Carolyn Gregoire&#8217;s popular article in the Huffington Post, Wired to Create offers a glimpse inside the &#8220;messy minds&#8221; of highly creative people. Revealing the latest findings in neuroscience and psychology, along with engaging examples of artists and innovators throughout history, the book shines a light on the practices and habits of mind that promote creative thinking. Kaufman and Gregoire untangle a series of paradoxes&#8211; like mindfulness and daydreaming, seriousness and play, openness and sensitivity, and solitude and collaboration &#8211; to show that it is by embracing our own contradictions that we are able to tap into our deepest creativity. Each chapter explores one of the ten attributes and habits of highly creative people:     </p>
<p>                     Imaginative Play * Passion * Daydreaming * Solitude * Intuition * Openness to Experience * Mindfulness * Sensitivity * Turning Adversity into Advantage * Thinking Differently     </p>
<p>                     With insights from the work and lives of Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Marcel Proust, David Foster Wallace, Thomas Edison, Josephine Baker, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, musician Thom Yorke, chess champion Josh Waitzkin, video-game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and many other creative luminaries, Wired to Create helps us better understand creativity &#8211; and shows us how to enrich this essential aspect of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this masterpiece, Jamil Zaki weaves together the very latest science with stories that will stay in your heart forever&#8217; &#8211; Angela Duckworth, author of Grit    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Scientific, gripping, groundbreaking and hopeful. The War for Kindness is the message for our times&#8217; &#8211; Carol Dweck, author of Mindset    </p>
<p>                     Empathy has been on people&#8217;s mind a lot lately. Philosophers, evolutionary scientists and indeed former President Obama agree that an increase in empathy could advance us beyond the hatred, violence and polarization in which the world seems caught. Others disagree, arguing it is easiest to empathize with people who look, talk or think like us. As a result, empathy can inspire nepotism, racism and worse.    </p>
<p>                     Having studied the neuroscience and psychology of empathy for over a decade, Jamil Zaki thinks both sides of this debate have a point. Empathy is sometimes an engine for moral progress, and other times for moral failure. But Zaki also thinks that both sides are wrong about how empathy works.      </p>
<p>                     Both scientists and non-scientists commonly argue that empathy is something that happens to you, sort of like an emotional knee-jerk reflex. Second, they believe it happens more to some people than others. This lines people up along a spectrum, with deep empaths on one end and psychopaths on the other. What&#8217;s more, wherever we are on that spectrum, we&#8217;re stuck there.      </p>
<p>                     In The War for Kindness, Zaki lays out a very different view of how empathy works, one that breaks these two assumptions. Empathy is not a reflex; it&#8217;s a choice. We choose empathy (or apathy) constantly: when we read a tragic novel, or cross the street to avoid a homeless person, or ask a distraught friend what&#8217;s the matter. This view has crucial consequences: if empathy is less a trait (like height), and more a skill (like being good at word games), then we can improve at it. By choosing it more often, we can flex our capabilities and grow more empathic over time. We can also &#8220;tune&#8221; empathy, ramping it up in situations where it will help and turning it down when it might backfire.    </p>
<p>                     Zaki takes us from the world of doctors who train medical students to empathise better to social workers who help each other survive empathising too much. From police trainers who help cadets avoid becoming violent cops to political advocates who ask white Americans to literally walk a (dusty) mile in Mexican immigrants&#8217; shoes. This book will give you a deepened understanding of how empathy works, how to control it and how to become the type of empathiser you want to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this fascinating and often hilarious work &#8211; winner of the Royal Society of Science Prize 2007 &#8211; pre-eminent psychologist Daniel Gilbert shows how &#8211; and why &#8211; the majority of us have no idea how to make ourselves happy.    </p>
<p>                              We all want to be happy, but do we know how? When it comes to improving tomorrow at the expense of today, we&#8217;re terrible at predicting how to please our future selves.    </p>
<p>                              In &#8216;Stumbling on Happiness&#8217; Professor Daniel Gilbert combines psychology, neuroscience, economics and philosophy with irrepressible wit to describe how the human brain imagines its future &#8211; and how well (or badly) it predicts what it will enjoy. Revealing some of the amazing secrets of human motivation, he also answers thought-provoking questions &#8211; why do dining companions order different meals instead of getting what they want? Why are shoppers happier when they can&#8217;t get refunds? And why are couples less satisfied after having children while insisting that their kids are a source of joy?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our brains were designed for tribal life, for getting along with a select group of others (Us), and for fighting off everyone else (Them). But modern life has thrust the world&#8217;s tribes into a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we can find our common ground.    </p>
<p>                    A grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the right kind of reasoning can move us forward.    </p>
<p>                    Joshua Greene is the director of Harvard University&#8217;s Moral Cognition Lab, a pioneering scientist, a philosopher, and an acclaimed teacher. The great challenge of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get along with Them when what they want feels so wrong? Finally, Greene offers a surprisingly simple set of maxims for navigating the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving problems and living better lives.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Amanda Palmer joyfully shows a generation how to change their lives&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To read Amanda Palmer&#8217;s remarkable memoir about asking and giving is to tumble headlong into her world&#8217; Elizabeth Gilbert    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The Art of Asking is a book about cultivating trust and getting as close as possible to love, vulnerability, and connection. Uncomfortably close. Dangerously close. Beautifully close&#8217; Brene Brown    </p>
<p>                    Imagine standing on a box in the middle of a busy city, dressed as a white-faced bride, and silently using your eyes to ask people for money. Or touring Europe in a punk cabaret band, and finding a place to sleep each night by reaching out to strangers on Twitter. For Amanda Palmer, actions like these have gone beyond satisfying her basic needs for food and shelter &#8211; they&#8217;ve taught her how to turn strangers into friends, build communities, and discover her own giving impulses. And because she had learned how to ask, she was able to go to the world to ask for the money to make a new album and tour with it, and to raise over a million dollars in a month.    </p>
<p>                    In the New York TImes bestseller The Art of Asking, Palmer expands upon her popular TED talk to reveal how ordinary people, those of us without thousands of Twitter followers and adoring fans, can use these same principles in our own lives.</p>

<p>                    In this &#8220;intellectual odyssey, traveler&#8217;s diary, and comic novel all rolled into one&#8221; (Daniel Gilbert, author of Stumbling on Happiness), acclaimed travel writer Weiner sets out to examine the connection between our surroundings and our most innovative ideas. A &#8220;superb travel guide: funny, knowledgeable, and self-deprecating&#8221; (The Washington Post), he explores the history of places like Vienna of 1900, Renaissance Florence, ancient Athens, Song Dynasty Hangzhou, and Silicon Valley to show how certain urban settings are conducive to ingenuity. With his trademark insightful humor, this &#8220;big-hearted humanist&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal) walks the same paths as the geniuses who flourished in these settings to see if the spirit of what inspired figures like Socrates, Michelangelo, and Leonardo remains. In these places, Weiner asks, &#8220;What was in the air, and can we bottle it?&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Fun and thought provoking&#8221; (Miami Herald), The Geography of Genius reevaluates the importance of culture in nurturing creativity and &#8220;offers a practical map for how we can all become a bit more inventive&#8221; (Adam Grant, author of Originals).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The coauthors of the bestselling Peak Performance dive into the fascinating science behind passion, showing how it can lead to a rich and meaningful life while also illuminating the ways in which it is a double-edged sword. Here&#8217;s how to cultivate a passion that will take you to great heights&#8211;while minimizing the risk of an equally great fall.  Common advice is to find and follow your passion. A life of passion is a good life, or so we are told. But it&#8217;s not that simple. Rarely is passion something that you just stumble upon, and the same drive that fuels breakthroughs&#8211;whether they&#8217;re athletic, scientific, entrepreneurial, or artistic&#8211;can be every bit as destructive as it is productive. Yes, passion can be a wonderful gift, but only if you know how to channel it. If you&#8217;re not careful, passion can become an awful curse, leading to endless seeking,  suffering, and burnout.<br />
                     Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness once again team up, this time to demystify passion, showing readers how they can find and cultivate their passion, sustainably harness its power, and avoid its dangers. They ultimately argue that passion and balance&#8211;that other virtue touted by our culture&#8211;are incompatible, and that to find your passion, you must lose balance. And that&#8217;s not always a bad thing. They show readers how to develop the right kind of passion, the kind that lets you achieve great things without ruining your life. Swift, compact, and powerful, this thought-provoking book combines captivating stories of extraordinarily passionate individuals with the latest science on the biological and psychological factors that give rise to&#8211;and every bit as important, sustain&#8211;passion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The monumental bestseller Quiet has been recast in a new edition that empowers introverted kids and teens      </p>
<p>                     Susan Cain sparked a worldwide conversation when she published Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#8217;t Stop Talking. With her inspiring book, she permanently changed the way we see introverts and the way introverts see themselves.     </p>
<p>                     The original book focused on the workplace, and Susan realized that a version for and about kids was also badly needed. This book is all about kids&#8217; world&#8211;school, extracurriculars, family life, and friendship. You&#8217;ll read about actual kids who have tackled the challenges of not being extroverted and who have made a mark in their own quiet way. You&#8217;ll hear Susan Cain&#8217;s own story, and you&#8217;ll be able to make use of the tips at the end of each chapter. There&#8217;s even a guide at the end of the book for parents and teachers.     </p>
<p>                     This insightful, accessible, and empowering book, illustrated with amusing comic-style art, will be eye-opening to extroverts and introverts alike.</p>

<p>                    Imagine knowing what the brain craves from every tale it encounters, what fuels the success of any great story, and what keeps readers transfixed. Wired for Story reveals these cognitive secrets&#8211;and it&#8217;s a game-changer for anyone who has ever set pen to paper.     </p>
<p>                    The vast majority of writing advice focuses on &#8220;writing well&#8221; as if it were the same as telling a great story. This is exactly where many aspiring writers fail&#8211;they strive for beautiful metaphors, authentic dialogue, and interesting characters, losing sight of the one thing that every engaging story must do: ignite the brain&#8217;s hardwired desire to learn what happens next. When writers tap into the evolutionary purpose of story and electrify our curiosity, it triggers a delicious dopamine rush that tells us to pay attention. Without it, even the most perfect prose won&#8217;t hold anyone&#8217;s interest.     </p>
<p>                    Backed by recent breakthroughs in neuroscience as well as examples from novels, screenplays, and short stories, Wired for Story offers a revolutionary look at story as the brain experiences it. Each chapter zeroes in on an aspect of the brain, its corresponding revelation about story, and the way to apply it to your storytelling right now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This original and lucid account of the complexities of love and its essential role in human well-being draws on the latest scientific research. Three eminent psychiatrists tackle the difficult task of reconciling what artists and thinkers have known for thousands of years about the human heart with what has only recently been learned about the primitive functions of the human brain.    </p>
<p>                    A General Theory of Love demonstrates that our nervous systems are not self-contained: from earliest childhood, our brains actually link with those of the people close to us, in a silent rhythm that alters the very structure of our brains, establishes life-long emotional patterns, and makes us, in large part, who we are. Explaining how relationships function, how parents shape their child&#8217;s developing self, how psychotherapy really works, and how our society dangerously flouts essential emotional laws, this is a work of rare passion and eloquence that will forever change the way you think about human intimacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book is AMAZING!&#8217; &#8211; MALCOLM GLADWELL    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;If you want to gain insight into the mind of great athletes, adventurers, and peak performers then prepare to be enthralled by Alex Hutchinson&#8217;s Endure.&#8217; &#8211; BEAR GRYLLS    </p>
<p>                              How high or far or fast can humans go? And what about individual potential: what defines a person&#8217;s limits? From running a two-hour marathon to summiting Mount Everest, we&#8217;re fascinated by the extremes of human endurance, constantly testing both our physical and psychological limits.    </p>
<p>                              In Endure Alex Hutchinson, Ph.D., reveals why our individual limits may be determined as much by our head and heart, as by our muscles. He presents an overview of science&#8217;s search for understanding human fatigue, from crude experiments with electricity and frogs&#8217; legs to sophisticated brain imaging technology. Going beyond the traditional mechanical view of human limits, he instead argues that a key element in endurance is how the brain responds to distress signals-whether heat, or cold, or muscles screaming with lactic acid-and reveals that we can train to improve brain response.    </p>
<p>                              An elite distance runner himself, Hutchinson takes us to the forefront of the new sports psychology &#8211; brain electrode jolts, computer-based training, subliminal messaging &#8211; and presents startling new discoveries enhancing the performance of athletes today, showing us how anyone can utilize these tactics to bolster their own performance &#8211; and get the most out of their bodies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>_____________________________<br />
                    Is having &#8216;somebody to love&#8217; the most important thing in your life?<br />
                    Do you constantly believe in Mr Right, and that being with him would guarantee you would no longer feel depressed or lonely?<br />
                    Are you bored with &#8216;nice guys&#8217; who are open, honest and dependable?     </p>
<p>                    If being in love means being in pain, this book was written for you. Leading relationship and marriage therapist Robin Norwood describes loving too much as a pattern of thoughts and behaviour, which certain women develop as a response to problems from childhood.     </p>
<p>                    Many women find themselves repeatedly drawn into unhappy and destructive relationships with men. They then struggle to make these doomed relationships work. This bestselling relationship self-help book investigates and reveals how powerfully addictive these unhealthy relationships are &#8211; but also gives a very specific programme for recovery from the disease of loving too much, a problem that plagues women everywhere.</p>

In A First-Rate Madness, Nassir Ghaemi, director of the Mood Disorders Programme at Tufts Medical Center, offers and sets forth a controversial, compelling thesis: the very qualities that mark those with mood disorders also make for the best leaders in times of crisis.     </p>
<p>                    From the importance of Lincoln&#8217;s &#8220;depressive realism&#8221; to the lacklustre leadership of exceedingly sane men as Neville Chamberlain, A First-Rate Madness overturns many of our most cherished perceptions about greatness and the mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Dr Daniel Crosby, comes the behavioral finance book all investors have been waiting for. In The Laws of Wealth, psychologist and behavioral finance expert Daniel Crosby offers an accessible and applied take on a discipline that has long tended toward theory at the expense of the practical. Readers are treated to real, actionable guidance as the promise of behavioral finance is realised and practical applications for everyday investors are delivered. Crosby presents a framework of timeless principles for managing your behavior and your investing process. He begins by outlining ten rules that are the hallmarks of good investor behavior, including &#8216;Forecasting is for Weathermen&#8217; and &#8216;If You&#8217;re Excited, It&#8217;s Probably a Bad Idea&#8217;. He then goes on to introduce a unique new taxonomy of behavioral investment risk that will enable investors and academics alike to understand behavioral risk in a newly coherent and complete way.From here, attention turns to the four ways in which behavioral risk can be combatted and the five equity selection methods investors should harness to take advantage of behaviorally-induced opportunities in the stock market.<br />
                    Throughout, readers are treated to anecdotes, research and graphics that illustrate the lessons in memorable ways. And in highly valuable &#8216;What now?&#8217; summaries at the end of each chapter, Crosby provides clear, concise direction on what investors should think, ask and do to benefit from the behavioral research. Dr. Crosby&#8217;s training as a clinical psychologist and work as an asset manager provide a unique vantage and result in a book that breaks new ground in behavioral finance. You need to follow the laws of wealth to manage your behavior and improve your investing process!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revolutionary new self-help book by top flight game designer Jane McGonigal.    </p>
<p>                              After suffering a brain injury, Jane McGonigal came up with a game to help aid her recovery and battle the ensuing depression she experienced. Half a million people have now played this game to astonishing results: depression gone in 6 weeks in some cases and even terminal cancer patients reporting that playing the game gives them a sense of control over their own health. The book shows readers how to use these techniques to find strength and create positivity: readers can look to their own &#8216;power-ups&#8217; which are little things they can do to feel better and tackle the hurdles in their own lives.    </p>
<p>                              This book provides simple step-by-step ideas that can be carried out in day-to-day life, helping you transform your life with a new flexible and reenergised mindset. In this book McGonigal uses her own story and those of others to expertly demonstrate how simple changes can result in dramatic life-affirming effects. And what&#8217;s more, she tells you how you yourself can lead a more &#8220;gameful&#8221; life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Born Liars, Ian Leslie takes the reader on an exhilarating tour of ideas that brings the latest news about deception back from the frontiers of psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy, and explores the role played by lies &#8211; both black and white &#8211; in our childhoods, our careers, and our health, as well as in advertising, politics, sport and war. Drawing on thinkers as varied as Augustine, Charles Darwin, Sigmund Freud and Joni Mitchell, the author argues that, far from being a bug in the human software, lying is central to who we are; that we cannot understand ourselves without first understanding the dynamics of deceit.     </p>
<p>                    After reading Born Liars you&#8217;ll never think about lies &#8211; or life &#8211; in quite the same way again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;[Dr. Malkin&#8217;s] reassuring tone and plethora of case histories offer considered advice and generous encouragement.&#8221; &#8212; Kirkus Reviews    </p>
<p>                    When most of us hear the word narcissism or narcissist, we envision vain, preening, braggarts who can&#8217;t stop talking about themselves. But most of the time, we&#8217;ve got it wrong; many narcissists aren&#8217;t driven by looks, fame, or money&#8211;some may even be shy or soft spoken. The startling truth is we&#8217;ve been distracted by an empty stereotype that blinds us to far more reliable signs of danger&#8211;and an entire generation is suffering because of it.     </p>
<p>                    In Rethinking Narcissism Harvard Medical School psychologist Craig Malkin addresses the narcissism epidemic by illuminating the spectrum of narcissism, identifying ways to control the trait, and explaining how too little of it may be a bad thing. Readers will learn that there&#8217;s far more to narcissism than its reductive invective would imply. The reality is that we all fall somewhere between utter selflessness and grandiosity. A healthy middle&#8211;a healthy degree of narcissism&#8211;is essential for a strong sense of self. Malkin deconstructs our misconceptions of narcissism and offers clear, step-by-step guidance on how to protect ourselves and how to promote healthy narcissism in our partners, our children, and ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How people succeed &#8211; and how you can, too.<br />
                    ***Sunday Times no. 1 bestseller***    </p>
<p>                    Alastair Campbell knows all about winning. As Tony Blair&#8217;s chief spokesman and strategist he helped guide the Labour Party to victory in three successive general elections, and he&#8217;s fascinated by what it takes to win.    </p>
<p>                    How do sports stars excel, entrepreneurs thrive, or individuals achieve their ambition? Is their ability to win innate? Or is the winning mindset something we can all develop? Drawing on the wisdom of an astonishing array of talented people &#8211; from elite athletes to top managers, from rulers of countries to rulers of global business empires &#8211; Alastair Campbell uses his forensic skills, as well as his own experience of politics and sport, to get to the heart of success. He examines how winners tick. He considers how they build great teams. He analyses how they deal with unexpected setbacks and new challenges. He judges what the very different worlds of politics, business and sport can learn from one another. And he sets out a blueprint for winning that we can all follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffett compares stock trading to great athletes: they excel not because of fast neurological responses, but because of their ability to delay as long as possible before reacting. Successful CEOs, fire fighters, and military officers all know how to manage delay to gather as much information as possible to get the results they need.    </p>
<p>                    In Wait, Frank Partnoy argues that decisions of all kinds, whether &#8216;snap&#8217; or long-term, benefit from being made at the last possible moment. The art of knowing how long you can afford to delay before committing is at the heart of many a great decision, whether in a corporate takeover or a marriage proposal. Apologies are better received if they are not rushed and people who can defer gratification are happier and more successful than those who must have everything now. Partnoy demonstrates that the ability to wait is crucial to getting the right answer and that gut instincts are often wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scientific evidence behind why we should maintain a lifestyle more like that of our ancestors to restore our health and well-being.     </p>
<p>                    In GO WILD, Harvard Medical School professor John Ratey, MD, and journalist Richard Manning reveal that although civilization has rapidly evolved, our bodies stopped changing long ago&#8211;creating a disconnect between how we live and what is best for us. This disconnect affects every area of our lives, from our energy levels to our relationships to our general health. Only by using ancient evolutionary instructions to navigate modern life can we realize our true potential in everything including strength, health and well-being, intelligence, happiness, and more. The book addresses modern diseases (from diabetes to cancer to addiction); the problems of the modern diet; exercise; sleep; mindfulness and relationships; and much more.</p>

<p>                    Former Olympian and best-selling author Matthew Syed is one of the advisors Gareth Southgate engaged from outside football in order to find new ways of working as a team. In Rebel Ideas, discover how Southgate &#8216;the man with the plan&#8217; replaced 50 years of hurt with two major tournament semi-finals in three years.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Matthew Syed&#8217;s phenomenal bestseller will change the way you think about success &#8211; for ever.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Syed is a superb storyteller. I couldn&#8217;t put the book down, and I learned so much. A stunning achievement&#8217; Tim Harford, author of The Undercover Economist    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas examines the power of &#8216;cognitive diversity&#8217; &#8211; the ability to think differently about the world around us.    </p>
<p>                    It explains how to harness our unique perspectives, pool our collective intelligence and tackle the greatest challenges of our age &#8211; from climate change to terrorism. It draws on a dazzling range of case studies, including the catastrophic failings of the CIA before 9/11, a fatal communication breakdown on top of Mount Everest and a moving tale of deradicalisation in America&#8217;s Deep South.    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas will strengthen any team or organisation, but has dozens of individual applications, too: from the art of reinvention to the remarkable benefits of personalised nutrition. It shows us how to become more creative, how to collaborate in a world becoming more interconnected, and how to break free of echo chambers that surround us all.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Robinson argues that organisations everywhere are trying to fix a problem that originates in schools and universities: &#8220;It is often said that education and training are the keys to the future. They are, but a key can be turned in two directions. Turn it one way and you lock resources away, even from those they belong to. Turn it the other way and you release resources and give people back to themselves. To realize our true creative potential-in our organizations, in our schools and in our communities we need to think differently about ourselves and to act differently towards each other. We must learn to be creative.&#8221; Ken Robinson The updated 3rd edition features a new introduction, modernized case studies, updated demographics and revised sections around technological developments and recent changes to the education system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Depression doesn&#8217;t happen all at once. It starts gradually and builds momentum over time. If you go through a difficult experience, you may stop taking care of yourself. You may stop exercising and eating healthy, which will end up making you feel even worse as time goes on. You are caught in a downward spiral, but you may feel too tired, too overwhelmed, and too scared to try and pull yourself back up. The good news is that just one small step can be a step in the right direction.    </p>
<p>                    In The Upward Spiral, neuroscientist Alex Korb demystifies the neurological processes in the brain that cause depression and offers effective ways to get better-one little step at a time. In the book, you&#8217;ll discover that there isn&#8217;t &#8220;one big solution&#8221; that will solve your depression. Instead, there are dozens of small, practical things you can do to alleviate your symptoms and start healing. Some are as simple as relaxing certain muscles to reduce feelings of anxiety, while others involve making small efforts toward more positive social interactions. Small steps in the right direction can have profound effects-giving you the power to literally &#8220;reshape&#8221; your brain.    </p>
<p>                    Like most people, you probably didn&#8217;t wake up one day and find yourself completely depressed. Instead, it probably happened over time, as a series of reactions to difficult situations and negative thinking. But if you are ready to reverse the trajectory of your depression and find lasting happiness, this book will show you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER and SHORTLISTED FOR THE WELLCOME BOOK PRIZE 2015     </p>
<p>                    As recently as thirty-five years ago, anxiety did not exist as a diagnostic category. Today, it is the most common form of officially classified mental illness. Scott Stossel gracefully guides us across the terrain of an affliction that is pervasive yet too often misunderstood.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own long-standing battle with anxiety, Stossel presents an astonishing history, at once intimate and authoritative, of the efforts to understand the condition from medical, cultural, philosophical and experiential perspectives. He ranges from the earliest medical reports of Galen and Hippocrates, through later observations by Robert Burton and Soren Kierkegaard, to the investigations by great nineteenth-century scientists, such as Charles Darwin, William James and Sigmund Freud, as they began to explore its sources and causes, to the latest research by neuroscientists and geneticists. Stossel reports on famous individuals who struggled with anxiety, as well as the afflicted generations of his own family. His portrait of anxiety reveals not only the emotion&#8217;s myriad manifestations and the anguish it produces, but also the countless psychotherapies, medications and other (often outlandish) treatments that have been developed to counteract it. Stossel vividly depicts anxiety&#8217;s human toll &#8211; its crippling impact, its devastating power to paralyse &#8211; while at the same time exploring how those who suffer from it find ways to manage and control it.    </p>
<p>                    My Age of Anxiety is learned and empathetic, humorous and inspirational, offering the reader great insight into the biological, cultural and environmental factors that contribute to the affliction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes a narcissist go from self-involved to terrifying? In this national bestseller, Joe Navarro, a leading FBI profiler, unlocks the secrets to the personality disorders that put us all at risk.      </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I should have known.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;How could we have missed the warning signs?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;I always thought there was something off about him.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    When we wake up to new tragedies in the news every day&#8211;shootings, rampages, acts of domestic terrorism&#8211;we often blame ourselves for missing the mania lurking inside unsuspecting individuals. But how could we have known that the charismatic leader had the characteristics of a tyrant? And how can ordinary people identify threats from those who are poised to devastate their lives on a daily basis&#8211;the crazy coworkers, out-of-control family members, or relentless neighbors?     </p>
<p>                    In Dangerous Personalities, former FBI profiler Joe Navarro has the answers. He shows us how to identify the four most common dangerous personalities&#8211;the Narcissist, the Predator, the Paranoid, and the Unstable Personality&#8211; and how to analyze the potential threat level. Along the way, he provides essential tips and tricks to protect ourselves both immediately and in the long-term, as well as how to heal the trauma of being exposed to the destructive egos in our world.</p>

<p>                     Why do successful companies reward failure?<br />
                     What can casinos teach us about building a happy workplace?<br />
                     How do you design an office that enhances both attention to detail and creativity?     </p>
<p>                     In The Best Place to Work, award-winning psychologist Ron Friedman, Ph.D. uses the latest research from the fields of motivation, creativity, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and management to reveal what really makes us successful at work. Combining powerful stories with cutting edge findings, Friedman shows leaders at every level how they can use scientifically-proven techniques to promote smarter thinking, greater innovation, and stronger performance.     </p>
<p>                     Among the many surprising insights, Friedman explains how learning to think like a hostage negotiator can help you diffuse a workplace argument, why placing a fish bowl near your desk can elevate your thinking, and how incorporating strategic distractions into your schedule can help you reach smarter decisions. Along the way, the book introduces the inventor who created the cubicle, the president who brought down the world&#8217;s most dangerous criminal, and the teenager who single-handedly transformed professional tennis&#8211;vivid stories that offer unexpected revelations on achieving workplace excellence.     </p>
<p>                     Brimming with counterintuitive insights and actionable recommendations, The Best Place to Work offers employees and executives alike game-changing advice for working smarter and turning any organization&#8211;regardless of its size, budgets, or ambitions&#8211;into an extraordinary workplace.</p>

<p>                    Sleep is one of the most important aspects of our life, health and longevity and yet it is increasingly neglected in twenty-first-century society, with devastating consequences: every major disease in the developed world &#8211; Alzheimer&#8217;s, cancer, obesity, diabetes &#8211; has very strong causal links to deficient sleep.    </p>

<p>                    Judith Grisel was a daily drug user when she began to consider that her addiction might have a cure, one that she herself could perhaps discover by studying the brain. Now, after twenty-five years as a neuroscientist, she shares what she and other scientists have learned about addiction, enriched by captivating glimpses of her personal journey.    </p>
<p>                    In Never Enough, Grisel reveals the unfortunate bottom line of all regular drug use: there is no such thing as a free lunch. All drugs act on the brain in a way that diminishes their enjoyable effects and creates unpleasant ones with repeated use. Delving into the science of one of the world&#8217;s most pressing health problems, she reveals what is different about the brains of addicts even before they first pick up a drink or drug, and highlights the changes that take place in the brain and behaviour as a result of chronic using.    </p>
<p>                    With compassion and clarity, Grisel describes what drove her to addiction, what helped her recover, and her belief that a &#8216;cure&#8217; for addiction will not be found in our individual brains but in the way we interact with our communities.</p>

<p>                    Oxford economist E. F. Schumacher provides an enlightening study of our economic system and its purpose, challenging the current state of excessive consumption in our society. Offering a crucial message for the modern world struggling to balance economic growth with the human costs of globalisation, Small Is Beautiful puts forward the revolutionary yet viable case for building our economies around the needs of communities, not corporations.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us assume that our creative process is beyond our ability to influence, and pay attention to it only when it isn&#8217;t working properly. For the most part, we go about our daily tasks and everything just works. Until it doesn&#8217;t. Adding to this lack of understanding is the rapidly accelerating pace of work. Each day we are face escalating expectations and a continual squeeze to do more with less. We are asked to produce an ever-increasing amount of brilliance in an ever-shrinking amount of time. There is an unspoken (or spoken!) expectation that we&#8217;ll be accessible 24/7, and as a result we frequently feel like we&#8217;re always on. Now business creativity expert Todd Henry explains how to unleash your creative potential. Whether you&#8217;re a creative by trade or an accidental creative, this book will help you quickly and effectively integrate new ideas into your daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the British Psychological Society Book Award for Popular Psychology    </p>
<p>                    Psychologists have long been aware that most people tend to maintain an irrationally positive outlook on life. In fact, optimism may be crucial to our existence. Tali Sharot&#8217;s original cognitive research demonstrates in surprising ways the biological basis for optimism. In this fascinating exploration, she takes an in-depth, clarifying look at how the brain generates hope and what happens when it fails; how the brains of optimists and pessimists differ; why we are terrible at predicting what will make us happy; how anticipation and dread affect us; and how our optimistic illusions affect our financial, professional, and emotional decisions.    </p>
<p>                    With its cutting-edge science and its wide-ranging and accessible narrative, The Optimism Bias provides us with startling new insight into how the workings of the brain create our hopes and dreams.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Despite 21st-century fears of an &#8216;epidemic&#8217; of loneliness, its history has been sorely neglected. A Biography of Loneliness offers a radically new interpretation of loneliness as an emotional language and experience. Using letters and diaries, philosophical tracts, political discussions, and medical literature from the eighteenth century to the present, historian of the emotions Fay Bound Alberti argues that loneliness is not an ahistorical, universal<br />
                    phenomenon. It is, in fact, a modern emotion: before 1800, its language did not exist. And where loneliness is identified, it is not always bad, but a complex emotional state that differs according to class, gender, ethnicity and experience.    </p>
<p>                    Looking at informative case studies such as Sylvia Plath, Queen Victoria, and Virginia Woolf, A Biography of Loneliness charts the emergence of loneliness as a modern and embodied emotional state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating multi-disciplinary analysis of why curiosity makes the world go round.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A lovely, erudite exploration of what it is that makes us human&#8217; &#8211; Independent on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious&#8217; Albert Einstein.     </p>
<p>                    Everyone is born curious. But only some retain the habits of exploring, learning and discovering as they grow older. Which side of the &#8216;curiosity divide&#8217; are you on?     </p>
<p>                    In Curious Ian Leslie makes a passionate case for the cultivation of our desire to know. Curious people tend to be smarter, more creative and more successful. But at the very moment when the rewards of curiosity have never been higher, it is misunderstood and undervalued, and increasingly practised only by a cognitive elite.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on fascinating research from psychology, sociology and business, Curious looks at what feeds curiosity and what starves it, and uncovers surprising answers. Curiosity isn&#8217;t a quality you can rely on to last a lifetime, but a mental muscle that atrophies without regular exercise. It&#8217;s not a gift, but a habit that parents, schools, workplaces  and individuals need to nurture if it is to thrive. Filled with inspiring stories, case studies and practical advice, Curious will change the way you think about your own mental life, and that of those around you.</p>

<p>                              We are not born knowing what to eat; we each have to figure it out for ourselves. From childhood onwards, we learn how big a portion is and how sweet is too sweet. The way we learn to eat holds the key to why food has gone so disastrously wrong for so many people. But how does this happen? And can we ever change our food habits for the better?    </p>
<p>                              An exploration of the extraordinary and surprising origins of our taste and eating habits, in First Bite award-winning food writer Bee Wilson explains how we can change our palates to lead healthier, happier lives.</p>

<p>                    What if your biggest mistake is that you never make mistakes?     </p>
<p>                    Ryan Babineaux and John Krumboltz, psychologists, career counselors, and creators of the popular Stanford University course &#8220;Fail Fast, Fail Often,&#8221; have come to a compelling conclusion: happy and successful people tend to spend less time planning and more time acting. They get out into the world, try new things, and make mistakes, and in doing so, they benefit from unexpected experiences and opportunities.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the authors&#8217; research in human development and innovation, Fail Fast, Fail Often shows readers how to allow their enthusiasm to guide them, to act boldly, and to leverage their strengths&#8211;even if they are terrified of failure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two New York Times-bestselling authors unveil new research showing what meditation can really do for the brain.     </p>
<p>                     In the last twenty years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it.     </p>
<p>                    Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open readers&#8217; eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change&#8211;even if we continue for years&#8211;without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidson&#8217;s own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice.     </p>
<p>                    Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.</p>

<p>                    What can we learn from our most disastrous failures?    </p>
<p>                    An accidental overdose in a state-of-the-art hospital.    </p>
<p>                    The Starbucks publicity stunt that spectacularly backfired.    </p>

<p>                    As technology rapidly advances, it brings with it an explosion of complexity that can trip us up. Meltdown uses real-life examples to reveal how errors in thinking, perception, and design lie behind both our everyday mistakes and our most terrifying disasters. It reveals how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. This eye-opening book will change the way you see our complex world &#8211; and your place within it.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve been so wowed by a new author&#8221;<br />
                    -Chip Health, co-author of The Power of Moments and Switch A talented journalist reveals the hidden patterns behind what we call &#8220;luck&#8221; &#8212; and shows us how we can all improve outcomes despite life&#8217;s inevitable randomness. &#8220;Do you believe in luck?&#8221; is a polarizing question, one you might ask on a first date. Some of us believe that we make our own luck. Others see inequality everywhere and think that everyone&#8217;s fate is at the whim of the cosmos. Karla Starr has a third answer: unlucky, &#8220;random&#8221; outcomes have predictable effects on our behavior that often make us act in self-defeating ways without even realizing it.  In this groundbreaking book, Starr traces wealth, health, and happiness back to subconscious neurological processes, blind cultural assumptions, and tiny details you&#8217;re in the habit of overlooking. Each chapter reveals how we can cultivate personal strengths to overcome life&#8217;s unlucky patterns. For instance: &#8211; Everyone has free access to that magic productivity app&#8211;motivation. The problem? It isn&#8217;t evenly distributed. What lucky accidents of history explain patterns behind why certain groups of people are more motivated in some situations than others? &#8211; If you look like an underperforming employee, your resume can&#8217;t override the gut-level assumptions that a potential boss will make from your LinkedIn photo. How can we make sure that someone&#8217;s first impression is favorable? &#8211; Just as people use irrelevant traits to make assumptions about your intelligence, kindness, and trustworthiness, we also make inaccurate snap judgments. How do these judgments affect our interactions, and what should we assume about others to maximize our odds of having lucky encounters?  We don&#8217;t always realize when the world&#8217;s invisible biases work to our advantage or recognize how much of a role we play in our own lack of luck. By ending the guessing game about how luck works, Starr allows you to improve your fortunes while expending minimal effort.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nudge meets Hooked in a practical approach to designing products and services that change behavior, from what we buy to how we work. Deciding what to create at modern companies often looks like an episode of Mad Men people throw ideas around until one sounds sexy enough to execute and then they scale it to everyone. The result? Companies overspend on marketing to drive engagement with products and services that people don&#8217;t want and won&#8217;t help them be happier and healthier. Start at the End offers a new framework for design, grounded in behavioral science. Technology executive and behavioral scientist Matt Wallaert argues that the purpose of everything is behavior change. By starting with outcomes instead of processes, the most effective companies understand what people want to do and why they aren&#8217;t already doing it, then build products and services to bridge the gap. Wallaert is a behavioral psychologist who has led product design at organizations ranging from startups like Clover Health to industry leaders such as Microsoft. Whether dissecting the success behind Uber&#8217;s ridesharing service or Flamin&#8217; Hot Cheetos, he underscores with clarity and humor how this approach can improve the way we work and live. This is an essential roadmap for building products that matter&#8211;and changing behavior for the better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new approach to mental disorder. Randolph Nesse&#8217;s insightful book  suggests that conditions such as anxiety and depression have a clear  evolutionary purpose &#8230; This intriguing book turns some age-old  questions about the human condition upside down&#8217; Tim Adams, Observer    </p>
<p>                    One of the world&#8217;s most respected psychiatrists provides a much-needed new evolutionary framework for making sense of mental illness    </p>
<p>                    With his classic book Why We Get Sick, Randolph Nesse established the field of evolutionary medicine. Now he returns with a book that transforms our understanding of mental disorders by exploring a fundamentally new question. Instead of asking why certain people suffer from mental illness, Nesse asks why natural selection has left us with fragile minds at all.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on revealing stories from his own clinical practice and insights from evolutionary biology, Nesse shows how negative emotions are useful in certain situations, yet can become excessive. Anxiety protects us from harm in the face of danger, but false alarms are inevitable. Low mood prevents us from wasting effort in pursuit of unreachable goals, but it often escalates into pathological depression. Other mental disorders, such as addiction and anorexia, result from the mismatch between modern environments and our ancient human past. Taken together, these insights and many more help to explain the pervasiveness of human suffering, and show us new paths for relieving it.    </p>
<p>                    Good Reasons for Bad Feelings will fascinate anyone who wonders how our minds can be so powerful, yet so fragile, and how love and goodness came to exist in organisms shaped to maximize Darwinian fitness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Elegant prose and excellent reporting . . . By the time I had finished reading, I had underlined many intriguing ideas.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;No doubt Inventology will be marketed to the creative business class, but there&#8217;s ample interest here even for readers who aren&#8217;t actively inventing anything.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Globe     </p>
<p>                     A doctor realizes that an innocent-looking tube is killing his patients, then reads a newspaper article that inspires him to create a better version that serves as an early warning system for infections. A father cleans up after his toddler and builds a &#8220;sippy&#8221; cup that won&#8217;t spill. An engineer dreams of a different world and pioneers the cell phone.     </p>
<p>                     By studying breakthroughs like these, we can learn how people imagine their way around &#8220;impossible&#8221; problems to discover groundbreaking answers. Pagan Kennedy reports on how enduring methods of invention can be adapted to the twenty-first century, as millions of us deploy tools like crowdfunding, big data, and 3-D printing to address our needs or realize our dreams. Drawing on fresh research and the surprising stories behind many inventions old and new to reveal the steps that most reliably produce discovery, Inventology is a myth-shattering book and a must-read for anyone who is curious about creativity and the mental leaps required to solve our most challenging problems.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;&#8216;Inventology&#8217; may be a real science; researchers are beginning to study it, and teachers are teaching it . . . A delightful account of how inventors do what they do.&#8221;&#8211;Kirkus Reviews, starred review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Offers a new perspective into the process of invention that will inform and illuminate.&#8221;&#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of the New York Times-bestselling Four Thousand Weeks, a totally original approach to self-help: success through failure, calm through embracing anxiety     </p>
<p>                    Self-help books don&#8217;t seem to work. Few of the many advantages of modern life seem capable of lifting our collective mood. Wealth&#8211;even if you can get it&#8211;doesn&#8217;t necessarily lead to happiness. Romance, family life, and work often bring as much stress as joy. We can&#8217;t even agree on what happiness means. So are we engaged in a futile pursuit? Or are we just going about it the wrong way?<br />
                     Looking both east and west, in bulletins from the past and from far afield, Oliver Burkeman introduces us to an unusual group of people who share a single, surprising way of thinking about life. Whether experimental psychologists, terrorism experts, Buddhists, hardheaded business consultants, Greek philosophers, or modern-day gurus, they argue that in our personal lives, and in society at large, it&#8217;s our constant effort to be happy that is making us miserable. And that there is an alternative path to happiness and success that involves embracing failure, pessimism, insecurity, and uncertainty&#8211;the very things we spend our lives trying to avoid. Thought-provoking, counterintuitive, and ultimately uplifting, The Antidote is the intelligent person&#8217;s guide to understanding the much-misunderstood idea of happiness.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Priya Parker has created both an art and a science to gathering in ways that can bring joy and fulfilment to any meeting&#8217; Deepak Chopra     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!&#8217; Chris Anderson, creator of TED    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     </p>
<p>                    Being deprived of gathering has revealed just how important it is to us; to connect with others, collaborate, share ideas and create moving, life-affirming experiences.    </p>
<p>                    At a time when coming together is more crucial than ever, Priya Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that can help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences in their lives, large and small, for work and for play.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her wide expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings &#8211; a court hearing, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp &#8211; and explains how simple changes can invigorate any group experience. The result is a book full of exciting ideas of real-world applications and one that will forever alter the way you look at your next business meeting, dinner party and garden barbecue.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    From one of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy, Religion for Atheists and The School of Life &#8211; Alain de Botton sets out to understand our universal fear of failure &#8211; and how we might change it    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;De Botton&#8217;s gift is to prompt us to think about how we live and how we might change things&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    We all worry about what others think of us. We all long to succeed and fear failure. We all suffer &#8211; to a greater or lesser degree, usually privately and with embarrassment &#8211; from status anxiety.     </p>
<p>                    Alain de Botton gives a name to this universal condition and sets out to investigate both its origins and possible solutions. He looks at history, philosophy, economics, art and politics &#8211; and reveals the many ingenious ways that great minds have overcome their worries. The result is a book that is not only entertaining and thought-provoking &#8211; but genuinely wise and helpful as well.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;He analyses modern society with great charm, learning and humour. His remedies come as a welcome relief when most books offering solutions to the stresses of life recommend the lotus position&#8217; Daily Mail</p>

<p>                              In Happy Fat, comedian Sofie Hagen shares how she removed fatphobic influences from her daily life and found self-acceptance in a world where judgement and discrimination are rife. From shame and sex to airplane seats, love and getting stuck in public toilets, Sofie provides practical tips for readers.    </p>
<p>                              Part memoir, part social commentary, Happy Fat is a funny, angry and impassioned look at how taking up space can be radical, emboldening and life-changing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re all hypocrites. Why? Hypocrisy is the natural state of the human mind. Robert Kurzban shows us that the key to understanding our behavioral inconsistencies lies in understanding the mind&#8217;s design. The human mind consists of many specialized units designed by the process of evolution by natural selection. While these modules sometimes work together seamlessly, they don&#8217;t always, resulting in impossibly contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and overinflated views of ourselves. This modular, evolutionary psychological view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions about ourselves, as well as a range of scientific theories that require a &#8220;self&#8221; with consistent beliefs and preferences. Modularity suggests that there is no &#8220;I&#8221;. Instead, each of us is a contentious &#8220;we&#8221; &#8211; a collection of discrete but interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our interactions with one another and our experience of the world.<br />
                    In clear language, full of wit and rich in examples, Kurzban explains the roots and implications of our inconsistent minds, and why it is perfectly natural to believe that everyone else is a hypocrite.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When BIC, manufacturer of disposable ballpoint pens, wanted to grow, it looked for an idea beyond introducing new sizes and ink colors. Someone suggested lighters.     </p>
<p>                     LIGHTERS?     </p>
<p>                     With an idea that seemed crazy at first, that bright executive, instead of seeing BIC as a pen company&#8211;a business in the PEN &#8220;box&#8221;&#8211;figured out that there was growth to be found in the DISPOSABLE &#8220;box.&#8221; And he was right. Now there are disposable BIC lighters, razors, even phones. The company opened its door to a host of opportunities.     </p>
<p>                     IT INVENTED A NEW BOX.     </p>
<p>                     Your business can, too. And simply thinking &#8220;out of the box&#8221; is not the answer. True ingenuity needs structure, hard analysis, and bold brainstorming. It needs to start     </p>
<p>                     THINKING IN NEW BOXES    </p>
<p>                     &#8211;a revolutionary process for sustainable creativity from two strategic innovation experts from The Boston Consulting Group (BCG).     </p>
<p>                     To make sense of the world, we all rely on assumptions, on models&#8211;on what Luc de Brabandere and Alan Iny call &#8220;boxes.&#8221; If we are unaware of our boxes, they can blind us to risks and opportunities.     </p>
<p>                     This innovative book challenges everything you thought you knew about business creativity by breaking creativity down into five steps:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Doubt everything. Challenge your current perspectives.<br />
                     &#8211; Probe the possible. Explore options around you.<br />
                     &#8211; Diverge. Generate many new and exciting ideas, even if they seem absurd.<br />
                     &#8211; Converge. Evaluate and select the ideas that will drive breakthrough results.<br />
                     &#8211; Reevaluate. Relentlessly. No idea is a good idea forever. And did we mention Reevaluate? Relentlessly.     </p>
<p>                     Creativity is paramount if you are to thrive in a time of accelerating change. Replete with practical and potent creativity tools, and featuring fascinating case studies from BIC to Ford to Trader Joe&#8217;s, Thinking in New Boxes will help you and your company overcome missed opportunities and stay ahead of the curve.     </p>
<p>                     This book isn&#8217;t a simpleminded checklist. This is Thinking in New Boxes.     </p>
<p>                     And it will be fun. (We promise.)     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Thinking in New Boxes     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Excellent . . . While focusing on business creativity, the principles in this book apply anywhere change is needed and will be of interest to anyone seeking to reinvent herself.&#8221;&#8211;Blogcritics     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Thinking in New Boxes is a five-step guide that leverages the authors&#8217; deep understanding of human nature to enable readers to overcome their limitations and both imagine and create their own futures. This book is a must-read for people living and working in today&#8217;s competitive environment.&#8221;&#8211;Ray O. Johnson, Ph.D., chief technology officer, Lockheed Martin     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Thinking In New Boxes discusses what I believe to be one of the fundamental shifts all companies/brands need to be thinking about: how to think creatively, in order to innovate and differentiate our brands. We need to thrive and lead in a world of accelerating change and this book challenges us to even greater creativity in our thinking. One of the best business books I&#8217;ve read in a long time.&#8221;&#8211;Jennifer Fox, CEO, Fairmont Hotels &#038; Resorts     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;As impressive as teaching new tricks to old dogs, Thinking in New Boxes is both inspirational and practical&#8211;a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to sharpening one&#8217;s wits in order to harness creativity in the workplace.&#8221;&#8211;Peter Gelb, general manager, Metropolitan Opera</p>

<p>                    In the vein of Susan Cain&#8217;s QUIET and Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s DAVID AND GOLIATH, HOW TO FLY A HORSE is a smart, empowering book that dispels the myths around genius and creativity.    </p>
<p>                    There is a myth about how something new comes to be; that geniuses have dramatic moments of insight where great things and thoughts are born whole. Symphonies are composed complete. Science is accomplished with eureka shrieks. Businesses are built by magic touch.    </p>
<p>                    The myth is wrong. Anyone can create.     </p>
<p>                    Acclaimed technology pioneer Kevin Ashton takes us behind the scenes of creation to reveal the true process of discovery and how &#8216;new&#8217; comes to be. From Archimedes to Apple, from Kandinsky to the Coke can, from the Wright brothers &#8211; who set out to &#8216;fly a horse&#8217; &#8211; to Woody Allen, he exposes the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures and countless ordinary and often uncredited acts that led to our most astounding breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of reproduction, and its variants, never change much, but our ideas about the meaning of sex are in constant flux. Switch a decade, cross a border, or traverse class lines and the harmless pleasures of one group become the gravest crimes in another.     </p>
<p>                    Combining meticulous research and lively storytelling, The Boundaries of Desire traces the fast-moving bloodsport of sex law over the past century, and challenges our most cherished notions about family, power, gender, and identity.     </p>
<p>                    Starting when courts censored birth control information as pornography and let men rape their wives, and continuing through the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; and into the present day (when rape, gay rights, sex trafficking, and sex on the internet saturate the news), Berkowitz shows how the law has remained out of synch with the convulsive changes in sexual morality.     </p>
<p>                    By focusing on the stories of real people, Berkowitz adds a compelling human element to what might otherwise be faceless legal battles. The law is made by people, after all, and nothing sparks intolerance &#8211; on the left and right &#8212; more than sex. Ultimately, Berkowitz shows the emptiness of sanctimonious condemnation, and argues that sexual questions are too subtle and volatile for simple, catch-all solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next Generation Indie Book Awards Winner in LGBT . &#8220;An important resource for readers of any age who are struggling to understand their sexual orientation, or those who would like to better understand asexuality.&#8221; -Library Journal, starred review<br />
                    Julie Sondra Decker&#8217;s book functions as a starting point for people interested in asexuality. It covers the basics of what asexuality is and isn&#8217;t, explores the most common issues asexual people may be dealing with, presents some pointers for newly asexual-identified people and the people who love them, and includes some resources to find out more. It&#8217;s for the layperson, written in everyday language.    </p>
<p>                    She writes for people who are on the asexual spectrum, people who think they might be asexual, friends and family and partners of people who have come out as asexual, curious parties, and those looking for information on the subject for their school papers, sexuality studies, and alternative sexuality resources. And it&#8217;s for people who think asexuality doesn&#8217;t exist. Chapters include:    </p>
<p>                    Asexuality as a Sexual Orientation<br />
                    Romantic Orientation<br />
                    Libido and Masturbation<br />
                    Intimate and Sexual Activity<br />
                    Asexual Relationships<br />
                    Asexual Community<br />
                    Should Asexual People Get Therapy and Be Fixed<br />
                    Am I Asexual?<br />
                    Should I Come Out?<br />
                    And much more    </p>
<p>                    If you think you may be asexual, or if you have a friend or partner who may be a sexual, this personal book will help you better understand what it means to be asexual in a world dominated by sexuality.</p>

                         Across the globe, diverse innovators are working in the black, grey, and informal economies to develop solutions to myriad challenges. Far from being &#8220;deviant entrepreneurs&#8221; that pose threats to our social and economic stability, these innovators display remarkable ingenuity, pioneering original methods and best practices that we can learn from and apply to formal markets in urgent need of change.</p>

<p>                    Foreword by Dr. Phil McGraw    </p>
<p>                    Ask yourself&#8230;are you truly who you want to be? Is this the life you really want? Are you living each day as your best self? What can you change, today?    </p>
<p>                    How would you answer those questions? Think about your daily life. Are you thriving, or going through the motions? Are your days full of work, relationships and activities that are true to your authentic self, or do you feel trapped on a treadmill of responsibility? If you dream of a better life, now is the time to turn your dream into reality. And the tools you need are within your grasp, to design a life that is fulfilling on the deepest levels. Best Self will show you how.    </p>

By asking them and leading them to ask themselves a series of important but tough questions-such as &#8220;What are your core values?&#8221;  &#8220;Do you go to bed each day more knowledgeable than when you woke up?&#8221; and &#8220;Am I neglecting some aspect of my physical health out of fear or denial?&#8221;-he helps them see what their Best Selves and Anti-Selves really look like. As a mental health specialist, a personal development coach, and an all-around change agent, Mike has seen the amazing ways in which lives can improve with honesty and clarity.  He understands our struggles intimately, because he&#8217;s faced-and overcome-his own. And he knows that change is possible.     </p>
<p>                    By working through each of the Seven SPHERES of life-Social, Personal, Health, Education, Relationships, Employment and Spiritual Development-Best Self is an accessible and interactive book that distills all of Coach Mike&#8217;s wisdom into a compact, focused guide that will ignite anyone&#8217;s desire for change. Chock full of revealing quizzes, and full of provocative questionnaires, Best Self will empower you to embrace your authenticity, acknowledge what is holding you back, and break through to live a passionate life to the fullest, forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestseller!     </p>
<p>                    A revelatory look at how our environment unconsciously yet dramatically shapes the judgments and decisions we make every day    </p>
<p>                    Most of us go through life believing that we are in control of the choices we make-that we think and behave almost independently from the world around us. But as Drunk Tank Pink illustrates, the truth is our environment shapes our thoughts and actions in myriad ways without our permission or even our knowledge. Armed with surprising data and endlessly fascinating examples, Adam Alter addresses the subtle but substantial ways in which outside forces influence us-such as color&#8217;s influence on mood, our bias in favor of names with which we identify, and how sunny days can induce optimism as well as aggression. Drunk Tank Pink proves that the truth behind our feelings and actions goes much deeper than the choices we take for granted every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For centuries, experts have argued that learning was about memorizing information: You&#8217;re supposed to study facts, dates, and details; burn them into your memory; and then apply that knowledge at opportune times. But this approach to learning isn&#8217;t nearly enough for the world that we live in today, and in Learn Better journalist and education researcher Ulrich Boser demonstrates that how we learn can matter just as much as what we learn.     </p>
<p>                    In this brilliantly researched book, Boser maps out the new science of learning, showing how simple techniques like comprehension check-ins and making material personally relatable can help people gain expertise in dramatically better ways. He covers six key steps to help you &#8220;learn how to learn,&#8221; all illuminated with fascinating stories like how Jackson Pollock developed his unique painting style and why an ancient Japanese counting device allows kids to do math at superhuman speeds. Boser&#8217;s witty, engaging writing makes this book feel like a guilty pleasure, not homework.    </p>
<p>                    Learn Better will revolutionize the way students and society alike approach learning and makes the case that being smart is not an innate ability&#8211;learning is a skill everyone can master. With Boser as your guide, you will be able to fully capitalize on your brain&#8217;s remarkable ability to gain new skills and open up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>

<p>                     This is the kick up the backside the self-help genre needs: an intelligent, provocative and thought-provoking expose of the modern myths that we&#8217;re told make us happier, but in reality screw us up.     </p>
<p>                     Clinical psychologist, Dr Stephen Briers shines a light into the dark corners of self-help and explodes the myths, false hopes, quack philosophies and unrealistic expectations it routinely advocates. It is a refreshing antidote to the `same old same old&#8217; approaches, offering a radical re-think of the way we approach problems in our lives, offering empowering new perspectives and expert advice on avoiding the biggest life traps. Dr Briers questions the perceived wisdom, shakes up the status quo, and encourages us to think again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Take a break and read Rest: you&#8217;ll make smarter decisions, have better relationships, and be happier and more creative&#8221; James Wallman, author of Stuffocation    </p>
<p>                     Do you regularly find yourself too tired after a long day at your desk to do anything other than binge TV, or scroll mindlessly through social media? Do you go on holiday and still compulsively check your email? Do you work through your lunch-break, often not even leaving your desk to get some fresh air?    </p>
<p>                     For most of us, overwork is the new norm, and we never truly take the time to rest and recharge. But as Silicon Valley consultant Alex Soojung-Kim Pang explains in this groundbreaking book, rest needs to be taken seriously and to be done properly, because when you rest better you work better.    </p>
<p>                     Drawing on emerging neuroscience, Rest is packed with easy practical tips for incorporating rest into our everyday:    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Go for a long walk to stimulate and sustain creativity<br />
                     &#8211; Schedule deliberate active rest periods into your diary to try out new activities like painting or learning a language<br />
                     &#8211; Stop working on a task when you know what the next step will be, this will make it easier to get started the next day<br />
                    &#8211; Establish clear boundaries between work and rest time<br />
                     &#8211; Take a nap during the day to increase alertness, boost your concentration and decrease fatigue<br />
                     &#8211; Get good quality sleep at night to stay healthy, solidify memories and generate new ideas    </p>
<p>                     When you rest better you&#8217;ll find that it won&#8217;t just be your work which improves &#8211; you&#8217;ll have more time for hobbies, stronger relationships and you&#8217;ll sleep better, too.    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An incredibly timely read for my own increasingly rest-starved life. This might be the book to finally persuade us that downtime isn&#8217;t in conflict with good work; rather, it&#8217;s an essential ingredient of it&#8221; Oliver Burkeman, Guardian</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your phone the first thing you reach for when you wake up? And the  last thing you see before you sleep? Do you find the hours slip away as  you idly scroll through your social media timeline?     </p>
<p>                     In short, are you addicted to your phone? If so, How to Break Up with Your Phone is here to help.     </p>
<p>                     How to Break Up With Your Phone  is a smart, practical and useful plan to help you conquer your mobile  phone addiction in just 30 days &#8211; and take back your life in the  process.     </p>
<p>                    Recent studies have shown that spending extended time  on our phones affects our ability to form new memories, think deeply,  focus and absorb information, and the hormones triggered every time we  hear our phones buzz both add to our stress levels and are the hallmark  signs of addiction. In How to Break Up with Your Phone,  award-winning science journalist Catherine Price explores the effects  that our constant connectivity is having on our brains, bodies,  relationships, and society at large and asks, how much time do you really want to spend on your phone?     </p>
<p>                    Over  the course of 30 days, Catherine will guide you through an  easy-to-follow plan that enables you to identify your goals, priorities  and bad habits, tidy your apps, prune your email, and take time away.  Lastly, you will create a new, healthier relationship with your phone  and establish habits and routines to ensure this new relationship  sticks.     </p>
<p>                    You don&#8217;t have to give up your phone forever; instead  you will be more mindful not only of how you use your phone, but also  about how you choose to spend the precious moments of your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When Ada Calhoun found herself in the throes of a midlife crisis, she thought that she had no right to complain. She was married with children and a good career. So why did she feel miserable? And why did it seem that the women around her were miserable, too?    </p>
<p>                    Calhoun decided to find some answers. She looked into housing costs, HR trends, credit card debt averages and divorce data. At every turn, she saw a pattern: sandwiched between the Boomers and the Millennials, Gen X women were facing new problems as they entered middle age, problems that were largely overlooked. Speaking with women across America about their experiences as the generation raised to &#8216;have it all,&#8217; Calhoun found that most were exhausted, terrified about money, under-employed, and overwhelmed. Instead of being heard, they were told instead to lean in, take &#8216;me-time&#8217;, or make a chore chart to get their lives and homes in order.    </p>
<p>                    In Why We Can&#8217;t Sleep, Calhoun opens up the cultural and political contexts of this predicament and offers solutions for how to pull oneself out of the abyss-and keep the next generation of women from falling in. The result is reassuring, empowering and essential reading for all middle-aged women, and anyone who hopes to understand them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a bestselling author and the most-followed psychologist on Twitter, this &#8220;intriguing new slant to personal transformation&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews) shows you how to take control of your life in an instant.  Victorian philosopher William James had a theory about emotion and behavior: It isn&#8217;t that our feelings guide our actions (feel happy and you will laugh). On the contrary, it is our actions that guide our emotions (laugh and you will feel happy). This led James to a remarkable conclusion: &#8220;If you want a quality, act as if you already have it.&#8221; Roused by James&#8217;s astonishing discovery, renowned psychologist and bestselling author Richard Wiseman confirms James&#8217;s principle and shows how the self-help genre has for too long put the cart before the horse in trying to help us take control of our lives. Bringing to the table a dazzling array of firsthand experiments, surprising histories, and psychological case studies, Wiseman illustrates in brilliant detail how we can apply this principle in our daily lives:  Smile to become measurably happier Wash your hands to drive away guilt Clench your fist to increase your willpower Eat with your nondominant hand to lose weight Nod while speaking to become more persuasive Act like a newlywed to rekindle your marriage  Lively, engaging, and truly mind-changing, The As If Principle is that rare gem that offers real, workable solutions for your day-to-day goals while helping you to instantly take control of your emotions. Whether it&#8217;s quitting a bad habit, persevering through a difficult task, or achieving your dream self, The As If Principle can help. Don&#8217;t just think about changing your life. Do it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Habits are more powerful than your will &#8211; if you know how to make them work for you    </p>
<p>                    Two strings are hanging from a ceiling, one at the centre of the room, one near the wall. You&#8217;re asked to tie the strings together, but you can&#8217;t reach both at the same time. You look around the room and see a table and a pair of pliers. How would you solve the problem?    </p>
<p>                    When confronted with challenges, most people let habits rule them (in this case, ignoring the pliers, the creative tool at your disposal). That is not surprising when you realise that at least a third of our waking hours are lived on auto-pilot &#8211; ruminating over past events, clicking through websites trawling for updates and the like. Such unconscious thoughts and actions are powerful. But the habits of the mind do not have to control us &#8211; we can steer them.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on hundreds of fascinating studies, psychologist Jeremy Dean &#8211; the mind behind the hugely popular and insightful website PsyBlog &#8211; shares how the new brain science of habit can be harnessed to your benefit, whether you&#8217;re hoping to eat moreveg, take an evening run, clear out your email backlog, or be more creative when faced with challenges at work and at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk and coauthor of The Grand Design (with Stephen Hawking), a startling and eye-opening examination of how the unconscious mind shapes our experience of the world.     </p>
<p>                     Winner of the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award     </p>
<p>                     Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world&#8211;our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment&#8211;is largely driven by the mind&#8217;s subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events&#8211;along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this culmination of five decades of acclaimed studies in presidential history, Doris Kearns Goodwin offers an illuminating exploration of the origin, uncertain growth, and finally, the exercise of fully developed leadership.    </p>
<p>                    Are leaders born or made? Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the man make the times or does the times make the man?    </p>
<p>                    In Leadership Goodwin draws upon four of the presidents she has studied &#8211; Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson &#8211; to show how they first recognized leadership qualities within themselves, and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entry into public life, when their paths were filled with confusion, hope, and fear, we can share their struggles and follow their development into leaders.    </p>
<p>                    Leadership tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to forever shatter their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times.     </p>
<p>                    No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities and temperament, they shared a fierce ambition, a hunger to succeed beyond expectations. All four, at their best, were guided by a sense of moral purpose that led them at moments of great challenge to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.    </p>
<p>                    This seminal work provides a roadmap for aspiring and established leaders. In today&#8217;s polarized world, these stories of authentic leadership in time of surpassing fracture and fear take on a singular urgency.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.&#8217; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    Everyone says they want to be happy. But that&#8217;s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness &#8211; from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#8217;s suggested routes to happiness and success &#8211; such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals &#8211; can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety.    </p>
<p>                    Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that &#8216;everything&#8217;s fine&#8217; even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Immensely positive and life-affirming&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;This is the blue print to a good life&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering researcher gives us a new understanding of stress and trauma, as well as the tools to heal and thrive.    </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking book examines the cultural norms that impede resilience in America, especially our collective tendency to disconnect stress from its potentially extreme consequences and override our need to recover. It explains the science of how to direct our attention to perform under stress and recover from trauma, exploring how our survival brain and thinking brain react to traumatic situations differently.    </p>
<p>                    By directing our attention in particular ways, we can widen the window within which our thinking brain and survival brain work together cooperatively. When we use awareness to regulate our biology this way, we can access our best, uniquely human qualities: our compassion, courage, curiosity, creativity, and connection with others. By building our resilience, we can train ourselves to make wise decisions and access choice &#8211; even during times of incredible stress, uncertainty and change.    </p>
<p>                    With stories from men and women Dr Stanley has trained in settings as varied as military bases, healthcare facilities, as well as her own striking experiences with stress and trauma, she gives readers hands-on strategies they can use themselves, whether they want to perform under pressure or heal from traumatic experience, while at the same time pointing our understanding in a new direction.    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Bessel Van Der Kolk, bestselling author of The Body Keeps the Score.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Widen the Window is a comprehensive overview of stress and trauma, responses to it, and tools for healing and thriving. It&#8217;s not only for those in high-intensity work, but for everyone.&#8217; &#8211; Mindful Magazine</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity&#8211;and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy    </p>
<p>                     Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. Whether it&#8217;s a confounding work problem or a faltering relationship or an unclear medical diagnosis, we face constant uncertainty. And we&#8217;re continually bombarded with information, much of it contradictory.     </p>
<p>                     Managing ambiguity&#8211;in our jobs, our relationships, and daily lives&#8211;is quickly becoming an essential skill. Yet most of us don&#8217;t know where to begin.     </p>
<p>                     As Jamie Holmes shows in Nonsense, being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We&#8217;re hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. This can be useful, of course. When a tiger is chasing you, you can&#8217;t be indecisive. But as Nonsense reveals, our need for closure has its own dangers. It makes us stick to our first answer, which is not always the best, and it makes us search for meaning in the wrong places. When we latch onto fast and easy truths, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective.     </p>
<p>                     In other words, confusion&#8211;that uncomfortable mental place&#8211;has a hidden upside. We just need to know how to use it. This lively and original book points the way.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Filled with illuminating stories&#8211;from spy games and doomsday cults to Absolut Vodka&#8217;s ad campaign and the creation of Mad Libs&#8211;Nonsense promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions.     </p>
<p>                     In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn&#8217;t IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It&#8217;s how we deal with what we don&#8217;t understand.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Genuinely brave and human&#8217; &#8211; The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Wildly brilliant&#8217; &#8211; Elle    </p>
<p>                    The true story of how a renowned writer&#8217;s struggle with mood storms led her to try a remedy as drastic as it is forbidden: microdoses of LSD. Her fascinating journey provides a window into one family and the complex world of a once-infamous drug seen through new eyes.    </p>
<p>                    When a small vial arrives in her mailbox from &#8216;Lewis Carroll,&#8217; Ayelet Waldman is at a low point. Her mood storms have become intolerably severe; she has tried nearly every medication possible; her husband and children are suffering with her. So she opens the vial, places two drops on her tongue, and joins the ranks of an underground but increasingly vocal group of scientists and civilians successfully using therapeutic microdoses of LSD. As Waldman charts her experience over the course of a month &#8211; bursts of productivity, sleepless nights, a newfound sense of equanimity &#8211; she also explores the history and mythology of LSD, the cutting-edge research into the drug, and the byzantine policies that control it. Drawing on her experience as a federal public defender, and as the mother of teenagers, and her research into the therapeutic value of psychedelics, Waldman has produced a book that is eye-opening, often hilarious, and utterly enthralling.</p>

<p>                    In this game-changing book, Professor Edward Bullmore reveals the breakthrough new science on the link between mental depression and physical inflammation. He explains how and why mental disorders can have their roots in the immune system and explores a whole new way of looking at how mind, brain and body all work together in a sometimes misguided effort to help us survive in a hostile world.</p>

In a concise and relatable manner, Peak Performance explains the strong connection between mind and body and how everyone can apply certain techniques to enhance their own achievements. This book is an entertaining and actionable guide to optimising personal performance that shows readers how to get the most from themselves. Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness highlight great performers across various disciplines including Olympic marathoner Meb Keflezighi, three-time Grammy Award winner Don Was, and renowned mathematician David Goss. This book discusses the science and application of each principle of success and concludes with prescriptive techniques.<br />

If you want to take your game to the next level, whatever &#8216;your game&#8217; may be, Peak Performance will teach you how.</p>

That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness.     </p>
<p>                    Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s famous investigations of optimal experience have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (the leading researcher into &#8216;flow states&#8217; &#8211;Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling author Dan Ariely reveals fascinating new insights into motivation&#8211;showing that the subject is far more complex than we ever imagined.     </p>
<p>                    Every day we work hard to motivate ourselves, the people we live with, the people who work for and do business with us. In this way, much of what we do can be defined as being &#8220;motivators.&#8221; From the boardroom to the living room, our role as motivators is complex, and the more we try to motivate partners and children, friends and coworkers, the clearer it becomes that the story of motivation is far more intricate and fascinating than we&#8217;ve assumed.     </p>
<p>                    Payoff investigates the true nature of motivation, our partial blindness to the way it works, and how we can bridge this gap. With studies that range from Intel to a kindergarten classroom, Ariely digs deep to find the root of motivation&#8211;how it works and how we can use this knowledge to approach important choices in our own lives. Along the way, he explores intriguing questions such as: Can giving employees bonuses harm productivity? Why is trust so crucial for successful motivation? What are our misconceptions about how to value our work? How does your sense of your mortality impact your motivation?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Achieving faster, better, cheaper, and more creative innovation outcomes with the 5&#215;5 framework: 5 people, 5 days, 5 experiments, $5,000, and 5 weeks.     </p>
<p>                    What is the best way for a company to innovate? Advice recommending &#8220;innovation vacations&#8221; and the luxury of failure may be wonderful for organizations with time to spend and money to waste. The Innovator&#8217;s Hypothesis addresses the innovation priorities of companies that live in the real world of limits. Michael Schrage advocates a cultural and strategic shift: small teams, collaboratively&#8211;and competitively&#8211;crafting business experiments that make top management sit up and take notice. He introduces the 5&#215;5 framework: giving diverse teams of five people up to five days to come up with portfolios of five business experiments costing no more than $5,000 each and taking no longer than five weeks to run. Successful 5x5s, Schrage shows, make people more effective innovators, and more effective innovators mean more effective innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mindfulness,the art of paying attention with an open and curious mind to present-moment experiences,has attracted ever-growing interest and tens of thousands of practitioners, who have come to the discipline from both within and outside the Buddhist tradition. In Fully Present, leading mindfulness researchers and educators Dr. Sue Smalley and Diana Winston provide an all-in-one guide for anyone interested in bringing mindfulness to daily life as a means of enhancing well-being. Fully Present provides both a scientific explanation for how mindfulness positively and powerfully affects the brain and the body as well as practical guidance to develop both a practice and mindfulness in daily living, not only through meditation but also during daily experiences, such as waiting in line at the supermarket, exercising, or facing difficult news.</p>

<p>                    The science of &#8216;sexonomics&#8217; is born:    </p>
<p>                    How much money does an ugly guy need to have to attract as many women via an online dating site as a hot man?<br />
                    Is modern marriage just an opportunity to consume more goods and services?<br />
                    Does raising the price of beer reduce risky sex?<br />
                    Why does a spike in the sale of sex toys predict an upcoming recession, while an increase in the number of breast lifts indicates a perkier economy is on the way?<br />
                    Which comes first: a prosperous nation or a promiscuous one?    </p>
<p>                    Once you read Dirty Money, you&#8217;ll never look at your money &#8211; or your relationships &#8211; the same way again</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Surprise: Embrace the Unpredictable and Engineer the Unexpected is a fascinating look at how we can handle and harness surprise in our work, relationships, and everyday lives.      </p>
<p>                    Pop Quiz!     </p>
<p>                    Do you prefer when:<br />
                    A) Things go according to plan?<br />
                    B) When the unexpected happens?     </p>
<p>                    Most of us pick control and predictability. Yet research reveals a counterintuitive truth: surprise is the key that unlocks growth, innovation, and connection. It is also the secret ingredient in our best memories.     </p>
<p>                    Through colorful narratives and compelling scientific findings, authors Tania Luna and Dr. LeeAnn Renninger shine a light on the world&#8217;s least understood and most intriguing emotion. They reveal how shifting our perception of surprise lets us thrive in the face of uncertainty. And they show us how surprise acts as a shortcut that turns a typical product into a meaningful experience, a good idea into a viral one, awkward small talk into engaging conversation, and daily life into an adventure.</p>

<p>                    Widely admired psychological researcher Rag Raghunathan sets out to find the answer, undertaking extensive research into the happiness of students, business people, stay-at-home-parents, lawyers, and artists, among others. From his research he reveals a crucial discovery: many of the psychological traits that lead to success ironically get in the way of happiness.    </p>
<p>                    Forging a new way forward, Raghunathan shows how we can transform these key traits of success, namely the need to be loved, the need for importance and the need for control, and replace them with other behaviours, goals and values to improve our life-long levels of happiness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A riveting ride through your own brain&#8217; &#8211; Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    WINNER of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&#8217;s book prize for &#8216;The Promotion of Social and Personality Science&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    If humans are fundamentally good, why do we engage in acts of great cruelty? If we are evil, why do we sometimes help others at a cost to ourselves?     </p>
<p>                    Whether humans are good or evil is a question that has plagued philosophers and scientists for as long as there have been philosophers and scientists.    </p>
<p>                    Many argue that we are fundamentally selfish, and only the rules and laws of our societies and our own relentless efforts of will can save us from ourselves. But is this really true?     </p>
<p>                    Abigail Marsh is a social neuroscientist who has closely studied the brains of both the worst and the best among us-from children with psychopathic traits whose families live in fear of them, to adult altruists who have given their own kidneys to strangers. Her groundbreaking findings suggest a possibility that is more optimistic than the dominant view. Humans are not good or evil, but are equally (and fundamentally) capable of good and evil.    </p>
<p>                    In The Fear Factor Marsh explores the human capacity for caring, drawing on cutting edge research findings from clinical, translational and brain imaging investigations on the nature of empathy, altruism, and aggression and brings us closer to understanding the basis of humans&#8217; social nature.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart, engaging and funny. It will make you question everything you think you know about what you want&#8217; Caroline Criado Perez, author of Invisible Women    </p>
<p>                    Be ambitious; find everlasting love; look after your health &#8230; There are countless stories about how we ought to live our lives. These narratives can make our lives easier, and they might sometimes make us happier too. But they can also trap us and those around us.    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Ever After, bestselling happiness expert Professor Paul Dolan draws on a variety of studies ranging over wellbeing, inequality and discrimination to bust the common myths about our sources of happiness. He shows that there can be many unexpected paths to lasting fulfilment. Some of these might involve not going into higher education, choosing not to marry, rewarding acts rooted in self-interest and caring a little less about living forever.    </p>
<p>                    By freeing ourselves from the myth of the perfect life, we might each find a life worth living.</p>

<p>                    Psychiatry has come a long way since the days of chaining &#8220;lunatics&#8221; in cold cells and parading them as freakish marvels before a gaping public.     </p>
<p>                    But, as Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, the former president of the American Psychiatric Association, reveals in his extraordinary and eye-opening book, the path to legitimacy for &#8220;the black sheep of medicine&#8221; has been anything but smooth.     </p>
<p>                    In Shrinks, Dr. Lieberman traces the field from its birth as a mystic pseudo-science through its adolescence as a cult of &#8220;shrinks&#8221; to its late blooming maturity &#8212; beginning after World War II &#8212; as a science-driven profession that saves lives. With fascinating case studies and portraits of the luminaries of the field &#8212; from Sigmund Freud to Eric Kandel &#8212; Shrinks is a gripping and illuminating read, and an urgent call-to-arms to dispel the stigma of mental illnesses by treating them as diseases rather than unfortunate states of mind.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A lucid popular history&#8230;At once skeptical and triumphalist. It shows just how far psychiatry has come.&#8221; &#8211;Julia M. Klein, Boston Globe</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people want to be successful in life. And of course, everyone wants to be happy. When it comes to the pursuit of success and happiness, most people assume the same formula: if you work hard, you will become successful, and once you become successful, then you&#8217;ll be happy. The only problem is that a decade of cutting-edge research in the field of positive psychology has proven that this formula is backwards. Success does not beget happiness.    </p>
<p>                    Based on the largest study ever conducted on happiness and human potential (a survey conducted by the author of more than 1,600 students), Harvard lecturer Shawn Achor shares seven core principles of positive psychology that each one of us can use to improve our performance, grow our careers, and gain a competitive edge at work. He reveals how happiness actually fuels success and performance, not the other way around. Why? Because when we are happier and more positive we are more engaged, creative, resilient to stress, and productive. The Happiness Advantage will appeal to anyone who wants practical advice on how to become happier and also more successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Extraordinary and courageous . . . No doubt if everyone were to read this book, the world would change.&#8221;&#8212;New York Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    New York Times-bestselling author Ron Powers&#8217; critically acclaimed narrative of the social history of mental illness in America paired with the deeply personal story of his two sons&#8217; battles with schizophrenia.    </p>
<p>                    From the centuries of torture of &#8220;lunatiks&#8221; at Bedlam Asylum to the infamous eugenics era to the follies of the anti-psychiatry movement to the current landscape in which too many families struggle alone to manage afflicted love ones, Powers limns our fears and myths about mental illness and the fractured public policies that have resulted.     </p>
<p>                    Braided with that history is the moving story of Powers&#8217;s beloved son Kevin&#8211;spirited, endearing, and gifted&#8211;who triumphed even while suffering from schizophrenia until finally he did not, and the story of his courageous surviving son Dean, who is also schizophrenic.     </p>
<p>                    A blend of history, biography, memoir, and current affairs ending with a consideration of where we might go from here, this is a thought-provoking look at a dreaded illness that has long been misunderstood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than 5 million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are &#8216;wired to connect&#8217; and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect our lives.    </p>
<p>                    Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers, shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies, down to the level of our genes &#8211; for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world. Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a &#8216;neural ballet&#8217; that connects us brain-to-brain with those around us.    </p>
<p>                    Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the &#8216;dark side&#8217; of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for &#8216;mindsight&#8217;, as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.    </p>
<p>                    In this book Daniel Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation and altruism &#8211; provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why are people around the world so very different? What makes us live, buy, even love as we do? The answers are in the codes. In The Culture Code, internationally revered cultural anthropologist and marketing expert Clotaire Rapaille reveals for the first time the techniques he has used to improve profitability and practices for dozens of Fortune 100 companies. His groundbreaking revelations shed light not just on business but on the way every human being acts and lives around the world. Rapaille&#8217;s breakthrough notion is that we acquire a silent system of codes as we grow up within our culture. These codes&#8211;the Culture Code&#8211;are what make us American, or German, or French, and they invisibly shape how we behave in our personal lives, even when we are completely unaware of our motives. What&#8217;s more, we can learn to crack the codes that guide our actions and achieve new understanding of why we do the things we do. Rapaille has used the Culture Code to help Chrysler build the PT Cruiser&#8211;the most successful American car launch in recent memory. He has used it to help Procter &#038; Gamble design its advertising campaign for Folger&#8217;s coffee &#8211; one of the longest lasting and most successful campaigns in the annals of advertising. He has used it to help companies as diverse as GE, AT&#038;T, Boeing, Honda, Kellogg, and L&#8217;Oréal improve their bottom line at home and overseas. And now, in The Culture Code, he uses it to reveal why Americans act distinctly like Americans, and what makes us different from the world around us. In The Culture Code, Dr. Rapaille decodes two dozen of our most fundamental archetypes&#8211;ranging from sex to money to health to America itself&#8211;to give us &#8220;a new set of glasses&#8221; with which to view our actions and motivations. Why are we so often disillusioned by love? Why is fat a solution rather than a problem? Why do we reject the notion of perfection? Why is fast food in our lives to stay? The answers are in the Codes. Understanding the Codes gives us unprecedented freedom over our lives. It lets us do business in dramatically new ways. And it finally explains why people around the world really are different, and reveals the hidden clues to understanding us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated with bonus material, including a new foreword and afterword with new research, this New York Times bestseller is essential reading for a time when mental health is constantly in the news.     </p>
<p>                    In this astonishing and startling book, award-winning science and history writer Robert Whitaker investigates a medical mystery: Why has the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States tripled over the past two decades?     </p>
<p>                    Interwoven with Whitaker&#8217;s groundbreaking analysis of the merits of psychiatric medications are the personal stories of children and adults swept up in this epidemic. As Anatomy of an Epidemic reveals, other societies have begun to alter their use of psychiatric medications and are now reporting much improved outcomes . . . so why can&#8217;t such change happen here in the United States? Why have the results from these long-term studies&#8211;all of which point to the same startling conclusion&#8211;been kept from the public?     </p>
<p>                    Our nation has been hit by an epidemic of disabling mental illness, and yet, as Anatomy of an Epidemic reveals, the medical blueprints for curbing that epidemic have already been drawn up.     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Anatomy of an Epidemic     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The timing of Robert Whitaker&#8217;s Anatomy of an Epidemic, a comprehensive and highly readable history of psychiatry in the United States, couldn&#8217;t be better.&#8221;&#8211;Salon     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How does your personality shape your life ,  and what, if anything, can you do about it?Are you hardwired for happiness, or born to brood? Do you think you&#8217;re in charge of your future, or do you surf the waves of unknowable fate? Would you be happier, or just less socially adept, if you were less concerned about what other people thought of you? And what about your  Type A&#8221; spouse: is he or she destined to have a heart attack, or just drive you to drink?In the past few decades, new scientific research has transformed old ideas about the nature of human personality. Neuroscientists, biologists, and psychological scientists have reexamined the theories of Freud and Jung as well as the humanistic psychologies of the 1960s, upending the simplistic categorizations of personality  types,&#8221; and developing new tools and methods for exploring who we are. Renowned professor and pioneering research psychologist Brian R. Little has been at the leading edge of this new science. In this wise and witty book he shares a wealth of new data and provocative insights about who we are, why we act the way we do, what we can,and can&#8217;t,change, and how we can best thrive in light of our  nature.&#8221; Me, Myself, and Us  explores questions that are rooted in the origins of human consciousness but are as commonplace as yesterday&#8217;s breakfast conversation, such as whether our personality traits are  set&#8221; by age thirty or whether our brains and selves are more plastic. He considers what our personalities portend for our health and success, and the extent to which our well-being depends on the personal projects we pursue.Through stories, studies, personal experiences, and entertaining interactive assessments,  Me, Myself, and Us  provides a lively, thought-provoking, and ultimately optimistic look at the possibilities and perils of being uniquely ourselves, while illuminating the selves of the familiar strangers we encounter, work with, and love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To perform better in any situation &#8211; in your career, hobbies, relationships, or in any facet of your life &#8211; it is critical to develop psychological skills, which, just like physical abilities, can be taught, learned, and practiced. Both as individuals and as groups, we can tone these<br />
                    psychological skills and use them to heighten awareness, foster talents and technical abilities, and reach peak performance. Mental preparedness and psychological awareness are the keys to thriving in any environment.     </p>
<p>                    Few understand the importance of psychological skills better than the internationally recognized professor Michael Bar-Eli. As both a sports and organizational psychologist for more than 35 years, Bar-Eli has not only researched the science of performance but has also worked directly with elite<br />
                    athletes, coaches, and teams to help them improve their success on the court or field. Boost! takes the lessons he&#8217;s learned from sports psychology and translates them for leaders and managers at any stage in their career. With prescriptive advice, Bar-Eli illustrates how anyone can apply these<br />
                    lessons to better support and inspire co-workers and employees and create a sustainable, successful working environment and business.     </p>
<p>                    Boost! breaks down the complex behavioral science of getting ahead. Through original scientific research, unique case studies, and anecdotes from the world of sports and beyond, Bar-Eli explains the psychological underpinnings of human behavior and how we can harness this knowledge to perform at our<br />
                    highest levels, succeeding in our careers and personal lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of us have experienced creative connection, and glimpsed its power. Yet, for centuries, the myth of the lone genius has obscured the critical story of the power of collaboration.     </p>
<p>                    In Powers of Two, Joshua Wolf Shenk argues that creative pairs are the exemplars for innovation. Drawing on years of research on great partnerships in history &#8211; from Lennon and McCartney to Marie and Pierre Curie, plus hundreds more in fields including literature, popular culture, art and business &#8211; Shenk identifies the common journey pairs take from the spark of initial connection, through the passage to a cognitive &#8216;joint identity&#8217; to competition and the struggle for power.     </p>
<p>                    Using scientific and psychological insights, he uncovers new truths about epic duos &#8211; and sheds new light on the genesis of some of the greatest creative work in history. He reveals hidden partnerships among people known only for their individual work (like C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien), and even &#8216;adversarial collaborations&#8217; among those who are out to beat each other. This revelatory and lyrical book will make us see creative exchange as the central terrain of our psyches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. That&#8217;s because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts so we sound smart and in control and so we fit into society.     </p>
<p>                     But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How do we get unstuck?     </p>
<p>                     For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique he&#8217;s used for years to solve all types of business problems and generate ideas for books, articles, and blog posts.     </p>
<p>                     Freewriting is deceptively simple: start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor won&#8217;t be able to keep up with your output&#8211;you&#8217;ll generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldn&#8217;t have created any other way.     </p>
<p>                     Levy shares his six secrets to freewriting as well as fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepower&#8211;seven of which are new to this edition. Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your raw freewriting into something you can share with the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the spirit of Gretchen Rubin&#8217;s megaseller The Happiness Project and Eric Weiner&#8217;s The Geography of Bliss, a journalist embarks on a project to discover what it takes to love where you live    </p>
<p>                    The average restless American will move 11.7 times in a lifetime. For Melody Warnick, it was move #6, from Austin, Texas, to Blacksburg, Virginia, that threatened to unhinge her. In the lonely aftermath of unpacking, she wondered: Aren&#8217;t we supposed to put down roots at some point? How does the place we live become the place we want to stay? This time, she had an epiphany. Rather than hold her breath and hope this new town would be her family&#8217;s perfect fit, she would figure out how to fall in love with it-no matter what.<br />
                         How we come to feel at home in our towns and cities is what Warnick sets out to discover in This Is Where You Belong. She dives into the body of research around place attachment-the deep sense of connection that binds some of us to our cities and increases our physical and emotional well-being-then travels to towns across America to see it in action. Inspired by a growing movement of placemaking, she examines what its practitioners are doing to create likeable locales. She also speaks with frequent movers and loyal stayers around the country to learn what draws highly mobile Americans to a new city, and what makes us stay. The best ideas she imports to her adopted hometown of Blacksburg for a series of Love Where You Live experiments designed to make her feel more locally connected. Dining with her neighbors. Shopping Small Business Saturday. Marching in the town Christmas parade.<br />
                         Can these efforts make a halfhearted resident happier? Will Blacksburg be the place she finally stays? What Warnick learns will inspire you to embrace your own community-and perhaps discover that the place where you live right now . . . is home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Two neuroscience experts explain how their 4-Step Method can help identify negative thoughts and change bad habits for good.     </p>
<p>                    A leading neuroplasticity researcher and the coauthor of the groundbreaking books Brain Lock and The Mind and the Brain, Jeffrey M. Schwartz has spent his career studying the human brain. He pioneered the first mindfulness-based treatment program for people suffering from OCD, teaching patients how to achieve long-term relief from their compulsions.Schwartz works with psychiatrist Rebecca Gladding to refine a program that successfully explains how the brain works and why we often feel besieged by overactive brain circuits (i.e. bad habits, social anxieties, etc.) the key to making life changes that you want&#8211;to make your brain work for you&#8211;is to consciously choose to &#8220;starve&#8221; these circuits of focused attention, thereby decreasing their influence and strength.    </p>
<p>                    You Are Not Your Brain carefully outlines their program, showing readers how to identify negative impulses, channel them through the power of focused attention, and ultimately lead more fulfilling and empowered lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the locker room to the living room to the boardroom&#8211;how winners become winners . . . and stay that way.     </p>
<p>                    Is success simply a matter of money and talent? Or is there another reason why some people and organizations always land on their feet, while others, equally talented, stumble again and again?     </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s a fundamental principle at work-confidence-that makes the difference between winning and losing in any competition, be it a high school basketball game or a high-stakes business situation. In Confidence, Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter shows why organizations of all types may be brimming with talent but not be winners. Based on her extraordinary investigation of success and failure in companies such as Continental Airlines and Verizon and sports teams such as the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, as well as the arenas of education, health care, and politics, Kanter explores a new theory and practice of success and provides people in leadership positions with a prescriptive program for maintaining a winning streak or turning around a downward spiral.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with brilliant, practical ideas, Confidence provides fresh thinking about success in all facets of life&#8211;from the factors that can make or break corporations and governments to the keys for successful relationships in the workplace or at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A &#8220;courageous, compassionate, and rigorous every-person&#8217;s guide&#8221; (Christina Bethell, PhD, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health) that shows the link between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs)  and diseases, and how to cope and heal from these emotional traumas.    </p>
<p>                    Your biography becomes your biology. The emotional trauma we suffer as children not only shapes our emotional lives as adults, but it also affects our physical health, longevity, and overall well-being. Scientists now know on a bio-chemical level exactly how parents&#8217; chronic fights, divorce, death in the family, being bullied or hazed, and growing up with a hypercritical, alcoholic, or mentally ill parent can leave permanent, physical &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; on our brains.    </p>
<p>                    When children encounter sudden or chronic adversity, stress hormones cause powerful changes in the body, altering the body&#8217;s chemistry. The developing immune system and brain react to this chemical barrage by permanently resetting children&#8217;s stress response to &#8220;high,&#8221; which in turn can have a devastating impact on their mental and physical health as they grow up.    </p>
<p>                    Donna Jackson Nakazawa shares stories from people who have recognized and overcome their adverse experiences, shows why some children are more immune to stress than others, and explains why women are at particular risk. &#8220;Groundbreaking&#8221; (Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance) in its research, inspiring in its clarity, Childhood Disrupted explains how you can reset your biology-and help your loved ones find ways to heal. &#8220;A truly important gift of understanding-illuminates the heartbreaking costs of childhood trauma and like good medicine offers the promising science of healing and prevention&#8221; (Jack Kornfield, author of A Path With Heart).</p>

<p>                    In How to Create a Mind, Ray Kurzweil offers a provocative exploration of the most important project in human-machine civilisation: reverse engineering the brain to understand precisely how it works and using that knowledge to create even more intelligent machines. Kurzweil explores how the brain functions, how the mind emerges from the brain, and the implications of vastly increasing the powers of our intelligence in addressing the world&#8217;s problems. He thoughtfully examines emotional and moral intelligence and the origins of consciousness and envisions the radical &#8211; arguably inevitable &#8211; future of our merging with the intelligent technology we are creating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature, Steven Pinker looks at how the relationship between words and thoughts can help us understand who we are.    </p>
<p>                      Why do so many swear words involve topics like sex, bodily functions or the divine? Why do some children&#8217;s names thrive while others fall out of favour? Why do we threaten and bribe and seduce in such elaborate, often comical ways? How can a choice of metaphor damn a politician or start a war? And why do we rarely say what we actually mean?     </p>
<p>                      Language, as Steven Pinker shows, is at the heart of our lives, and through the way we use it &#8211; whether to inform, persuade, entertain or manipulate &#8211; we can glimpse the very essence of what makes us human.     </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Awesome&#8217;<br />

<p>                      &#8216;Anyone interested in language should read The Stuff of Thought &#8230; moments of genuine revelation and some very good jokes&#8217;<br />
                      Mark Haddon, Sunday Telegraph Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;No one writes about language as clearly as Steven Pinker, and this is his best book yet&#8217;<br />
                      David Crystal, Financial Times    </p>
<p>                      Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Until 2003, he taught in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He conducts research on language and cognition, writes for publications such as The New York Times, Time and Slate, and is the author of six books, including The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In How to Have a Good Day, economist and former McKinsey partner Caroline Webb shows readers how to use recent findings from behavioral economics, psychology, and neuroscience to transform our approach to everyday working life.    </p>
<p>                    Advances in these behavioral sciences are giving us ever better understanding of how our brains work, why we make the choices we do, and what it takes for us to be smart and savvy. But it&#8217;s not always been easy to see how to apply these insights in the workplace &#8211; until now.    </p>
<p>                    In How to Have a Good Day, Webb explains how three big scientific ideas can help us be at our best every day. She shows us exactly how to apply this science to our plans, tasks and conversations, in step-by-step guidance that allows us to:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Set better priorities<br />
                    &#8211; Make the hours go further<br />
                    &#8211; Turn every interaction into a success<br />
                    &#8211; Strengthen our personal impact<br />
                    &#8211; Be resilient in the face of setbacks<br />
                    &#8211; Sustain our energy over the course of the day     </p>
<p>                    Webb teaches us how to be at our best under pressure, and gives us specific tools to tackle common work challenges &#8211; from conflict with colleagues, to dull meetings and packed inboxes.    </p>
<p>                    Filled with stories of people who have used Webb&#8217;s insights to boost their job satisfaction and performance at work, How to Have a Good Day is the book so many people wanted when they finished Nudge, Blink and Thinking Fast and Slow, and were looking for practical ways to apply this fascinating science to their own lives and careers.    </p>
<p>                    A remarkable and much needed book, How to Have a Good Day firmly delivers on its promise, showing us all how to have a lifetime of good days.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Wise, fun and humane. The best behavioural self-help book by far. Everyone should read it.&#8217; &#8211; Cass R. Sunstein, co-author of Nudge</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Psychologists and philosophers have long grappled with the mysteries of dreaming, and now-thanks largely to recent innovations in brain imaging -neuroscientists are starting to join the conversation. In this ground-breaking book, award-winning journalist Andrea Rock traces the brief but fascinating history of this emerging field. She then takes us into modern sleep labs across the country, asking the questions that intrigue us all: Why do we remember only a fraction of our dreams? Why are dreams usually accompanied by intense emotions? Can dreams truly spark creative thought or help solve problems? Are the universal dream interpretations of Freud and Jung valid? Accessible and engaging, The Mind at Night shines a bright light on our nocturnal journeys and tells us what the sleeping mind reveals about our waking hours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The urge to tidiness seems to be rooted deep in the human psyche. Many of us feel threatened by anything that is vague, unplanned, scattered around or hard to describe. We find comfort in having a script to rely on, a system to follow, in being able to categorise and file away.    </p>
<p>                    We all benefit from tidy organisation &#8211; up to a point. A large library needs a reference system. Global trade needs the shipping container. Scientific collaboration needs measurement units. But the forces of tidiness have marched too far. Corporate middle managers and government bureaucrats have long tended to insist that everything must have a label, a number and a logical place in a logical system. Now that they are armed with computers and serial numbers, there is little to hold this tidy-mindedness in check. It&#8217;s even spilling into our personal lives, as we corral our children into sanitised play areas or entrust our quest for love to the soulless algorithms of dating websites. Order is imposed when chaos would be more productive. Or if not chaos, then . . . messiness.    </p>
<p>                    The trouble with tidiness is that, in excess, it becomes rigid, fragile and sterile. In Messy, Tim Harford reveals how qualities we value more than ever &#8211; responsiveness, resilience and creativity &#8211; simply cannot be disentangled from the messy soil that produces them.     </p>
<p>                    This, then, is a book about the benefits of being messy: messy in our private lives; messy in the office, with piles of paper on the desk and unread spreadsheets; messy in the recording studio, the laboratory or in preparing for an important presentation; and messy in our approach to business, politics and economics, leaving things vague, diverse and uncomfortably made-up-on-the-spot. It&#8217;s time to rediscover the benefits of a little mess.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re in the midst of a parenting climate that feeds on more. More expert advice, more gear, more fear about competition and safety, and more choices to make about education, nutrition, even entertainment. The result? Overwhelmed, confused parents and overscheduled, overparented kids.    </p>
<p>                    In MINIMALIST PARENTING, Christine Koh and Asha Dornfest offer a fresh approach to navigating all of this conflicting background &#8220;noise.&#8221;  They show how to tune into your family&#8217;s unique values and priorities and confidently identify the activities, stuff, information, and people that truly merit space in your life.    </p>
<p>                    The book begins by showing the value of a minimalist approach, backed by the authors&#8217; personal experience practicing it. It then leads parents through practical strategies for managing time, decluttering the home space, simplifying mealtimes, streamlining recreation, and prioritizing self-care. Filled with parents&#8217; personal stories, readers will come away with a unique plan for a simpler life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER &#8211; OVER 1.5 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A deeply compassionate guide to self-care &#8211; simple and profound&#8217; Sir Kenneth Branagh    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you want to free yourself from anxiety and stress, and feel truly at ease with yourself, then read this book&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Authoritative, beautifully written and much-loved by its readers, Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world has become a word-of-mouth bestseller and global phenomenon. It reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that you can incorporate into daily life to break the cycle of anxiety, stress unhappiness and exhaustion. It promotes the kind of happiness that gets into your bones and allows you to meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.     </p>
<p>                    Mindfulness is based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Co-developed by Professor Mark Williams of Oxford University, MBCT is recommended by the UK&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is as effective as drugs for preventing depression. But, equally, it works for the rest of us who aren&#8217;t depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the relentless demands of the modern world.     </p>
<p>                    By investing just a few minutes each day, this classic guide to mindfulness will put you back in control of your life once again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unprecedented history of the personality test conceived a century ago by a mother and her daughter&#8211;fiction writers with no formal training in psychology&#8211;and how it insinuated itself into our boardrooms, classrooms, and beyond. The basis for the HBO Max documentary, Persona    </p>
<p>                    The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It is used regularly by Fortune 500 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language of personality types&#8211;extraversion and introversion, sensing and intuiting, thinking and feeling, judging and perceiving&#8211;has inspired television shows, online dating platforms, and Buzzfeed quizzes. Yet despite the test&#8217;s widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $2 billion industry, have struggled to validate its results&#8211;no less account for its success. How did Myers-Briggs, a homegrown multiple choice questionnaire, infiltrate our workplaces, our relationships, our Internet, our lives?     </p>
<p>                    First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of devoted homemakers, novelists, and amateur psychoanalysts, Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life entirely its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was administered to some of the twentieth century&#8217;s greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo, until it could be found just as easily in elementary schools, nunneries, and wellness retreats as in shadowy political consultancies and on social networks.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, The Personality Brokers takes a critical look at the personality indicator that became a cultural icon. Along the way it examines nothing less than the definition of the self&#8211;our attempts to grasp, categorize, and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you, you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fascinating . . . If you&#8217;re a generalist who has ever felt overshadowed by your specialist colleagues, this book is for you&#8217; &#8211; Bill Gates    </p>
<p>                    The instant Sunday Times Top Ten and New York Times bestseller<br />
                    Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award<br />
                    A Financial Times Essential Reads    </p>
<p>                    A powerful argument for how to succeed in any field: develop broad interests and skills while everyone around you is rushing to specialize.     </p>
<p>                    From the &#8216;10,000 hours rule&#8217; to the power of Tiger parenting, we have been taught that success in any field requires early specialization and many hours of deliberate practice. And, worse, that if you dabble or delay, you&#8217;ll never catch up with those who got a head start.     </p>
<p>                    This is completely wrong.    </p>
<p>                    In this landmark book, David Epstein shows you that the way to succeed is by sampling widely, gaining a breadth of experiences, taking detours, experimenting relentlessly, juggling many interests &#8211; in other words, by developing range.    </p>
<p>                    Studying the world&#8217;s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors and scientists, Epstein demonstrates why in most fields &#8211; especially those that are complex and unpredictable &#8211; generalists, not specialists are primed to excel. No matter what you do, where you are in life, whether you are a teacher, student, scientist, business analyst, parent, job hunter, retiree, you will see the world differently after you&#8217;ve read Range. You&#8217;ll understand better how we solve problems, how we learn and how we succeed. You&#8217;ll see why failing a test is the best way to learn and why frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers.     </p>
<p>                    As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, Range shows how people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive and why spreading your knowledge across multiple domains is the key to your success, and how to achieve it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved Range&#8217; &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.&#8217; &#8211; Daniel H. Pink    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;So much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education.&#8217; &#8211; Susan Cain, bestselling author of Quiet</p>

<p>                    Debunks the idea that aging inevitably brings infirmity and unhappiness and instead offers a trove of practical, evidence-based guidance for living longer and better.<br />
                    &#8211;Daniel H. Pink, author of When and Drive     </p>
<p>                    SUCCESSFUL AGING delivers powerful insights:<br />
                     &#8211; Debunking the myth that memory always declines with age<br />
                     &#8211; Confirming that health span&#8211;not life span&#8211;is what matters<br />
                     &#8211; Proving that sixty-plus years is a unique and newly recognized developmental stage<br />
                     &#8211; Recommending that people look forward to joy, as reminiscing doesn&#8217;t promote health     </p>
<p>                     Levitin looks at the science behind what we all can learn from those who age joyously, as well as how to adapt our culture to take full advantage of older people&#8217;s wisdom and experience. Throughout his exploration of what aging really means, using research from developmental neuroscience and the psychology of individual differences, Levitin reveals resilience strategies and practical, cognitive- enhancing tricks everyone should do as they age.     </p>
<p>                     Successful Aging inspires a powerful new approach to how readers think about our final decades, and it will revolutionize the way we plan for old age as individuals, family members, and citizens within a society where the average life expectancy continues to rise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like most people, you think that your choices and behaviors are driven by your individual, personal tastes and opinions.<br />
                        You picked a jacket because you liked the way it looked. You picked a particular career because you found itinteresting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions seems so obvious that it is not even worth mentioning. Except that it&#8217;s wrong.<br />
                        Without our realizing it, other people&#8217;s behavior &#8211; what psychologists call &#8220;social influence&#8221; &#8211; has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane (which movie to see or place to have lunch) to the momentous (which career path to take or person to marry).<br />
                        We make riskier decisions because someone patted us on the shoulder. We like the name Mia because Madison and Sophia are popular names this year. Even strangers, or people we may never meet, have a startling impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes towards a welfare policy totally shift if we&#8217;re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans, even though the policy is the same in both cases.<br />
                        But social influence doesn&#8217;t just lead us to do the same things as others. Like a magnet it can attract, but it also can repel. In some cases we conform, or imitate others around us. But in other cases we diverge, or avoid particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don&#8217;t want to look like the soccer mom.<br />
                        By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it: we can affect others behavior and use others to help us make better-informed decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times-bestselling author of Better Than Normal, esteemed psychiatrist Dale Archer, M.D., reveals how ADHD might be the key to your success.     </p>
<p>                     For decades, in the United States and in countries around the world, physicians delivered the diagnosis of ADHD to patients as bad news and warned them about a lifelong struggle of managing symptoms. But The ADHD Advantage explodes this outlook, arguing that some of the most highly successful entrepreneurs, leaders, and entertainers have reached the pinnacle of success not in spite of their ADHD but because of it.     </p>
<p>                    People with ADHD are restless, endlessly curious, often adventurous, willing to take smart risks, and unusually resilient, and their ranks include some of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time. Sharing the stories of highly successful people with ADHD, Archer offers a vitally important and inspiring new way to recognize ADHD traits in oneself or in one&#8217;s loved ones and then leverage them to great advantage. Readers will learn to harness mental energy for greater creativity, embrace multitasking, and build a path to great success&#8211;without medication. As someone who not only has ADHD himself but has never used medication to treat it, Dr. Archer understands the condition from a unique professional and personal standpoint. Armed with new science and research, and his own personal experience, he teaches readers to embrace their natural strengths and innate potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific and philosophical concepts can change the way we solve problems by helping us to think more effectively about our behavior and our world. Surprisingly, despite their utility, many of these tools remain unknown to most of us.     </p>
<p>                    In Mindware, the world-renowned psychologist Richard E. Nisbett presents these ideas in clear and accessible detail, offering a tool kit for better thinking and wiser decisions. He has made a distinguished career of studying and teaching such powerful problem-solving concepts as the law of large numbers, statistical regression, cost-benefit analysis, sunk costs and opportunity costs, and causation and correlation, probing how best to teach others to use them effectively in their daily lives. In this groundbreaking book, he shows that a course in a given field&#8211;statistics or economics, for example&#8211;often doesn&#8217;t work as well as a few minutes of more practical instruction in analyzing everyday situations. Mindware shows how to reframe common problems in such a way that these powerful scientific and statistical concepts can be applied to them. The result is an enlightening and practical guide to the most powerful tools of reasoning ever developed&#8211;tools that can easily be used to make better professional, business, and personal decisions.</p>

                    Why can some people effortlessly command the attention of everyone in the room?    </p>
<p>                    What makes some individuals seem immediately credible and others appear inherently untrustworthy?    </p>
<p>                    And how is it that precisely the same idea can be enthusiastically embraced or roundly rejected depending on who has put it forward?    </p>
<p>                    When we talk to others, we assume that they are carefully weighing our words and arguments. But these are far from  being the only factors that hold sway.    </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking new book, bestselling behavioural scientists Stephen Martin and Joseph Marks explore the eight powerful human traits that help determine whether what we have to say gets heard or lands on deaf ears. They show how seemingly irrelevant details about our demeanour influence others&#8217; responses. They explain how trust is won, even when it may not be deserved. They show how the most trivial of signals &#8211; like the shape of our face, the shoes we wear or the car we drive &#8211; can influence how people respond to us.    </p>
<p>                    And in a world of uncertainty and fake news they demonstrate how, increasingly, the Messenger is the Message.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Some books make us better citizens. Others make us better at our jobs. This amazing book does both!&#8217;<br />

                    Professor Robert Cialdini, author of Influence and Pre-suasion    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Messengers is engaging, informative and entertaining. It will change the way you think about who you follow and take advice from. But why would you listen to me? Read their book to find out.&#8217;<br />
                    Professor Tali Sharot, author of The Optimism Bias and The Influential Mind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A powerful, profoundly illuminating exploration of one of the most important subjects of our time. Martin and Marks have a terrific talent for combining evidence and research with lively and vivid writing. Trust these messengers!&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, human beings tend to think of happiness as a natural right. But they haven&#8217;t always felt this way. For the ancient Greeks, happiness meant virtue. For the Romans, it implied prosperity and divine favor. For Christians, happiness was synonymous with God. Throughout history, happiness has been equated regularly with the highest human calling, the most perfect human state. Yet it&#8217;s only within the past two hundred years that human beings have begun to think of happiness as not just an earthly possibility but also as an earthly entitlement, even an obligation. In this sweeping new book, historian Darrin M. McMahon argues that our modern belief in happiness is the product of a dramatic revolution in human expectations carried out since the eighteenth century.<br />
                    In the tradition of works by Peter Gay and Simon Schama, Happiness draws on a multitude of sources, including art and architecture, poetry and scripture, music and theology, and literature and myth, to offer a sweeping intellectual history of man&#8217;s most elusive yet coveted goal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our lives are getting faster and faster. We are engulfed in constant distraction from email, social media and our &#8216;always on&#8217; work culture. We are too busy, too overloaded with information and too focused on analytical left-brain thinking processes to be creative. Too Fast to Think exposes how our current work practices, media culture and education systems are detrimental to innovation. The speed and noise of modern life is undermining the clarity and quiet that is essential to power individual thought. Our best ideas are often generated when we are free to think diffusely, in an uninterrupted environment, which is why moments of inspiration so often occur in places completely separate to our offices.     </p>
<p>                    To reclaim creativity, Too Fast to Think teaches you how to retrain your brain into allowing creative ideas to emerge, before they are shut down by interruption, distraction or the self-doubt of your over-rational brain. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to maximize their creative potential, as well as that of their team. Supported by cutting-edge research from the University of the Arts London and insightful interviews with business leaders, academics, artists, politicians and psychologists, Chris Lewis takes a holistic approach to explain the 8 crucial traits that are inherently linked to creation and innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In  Ungifted , cognitive psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman,who was relegated to special education as a child,offers a new way of looking at intelligence. He explores the latest research in genetics, neuroscience, and psychology to challenge the conventional wisdom about the childhood predictors of adult success, arguing for a more holistic approach to intelligence that takes into account each individual&#8217;s abilities, engagement, and personal goals. Combining original research and a singular compassion,  Ungifted  increases our appreciation for all different kinds of minds and ways of achieving both personally meaningful and publicly recognized forms of success.</p>

<p>                    It  shapes every interaction we have, whether we&#8217;re trying to get a  two-year-old to eat green vegetables or ask for a promotion at work. But  how do we really gain and maintain power &#8211; through coercion or cooperation?  What does it do to our behaviour? And what makes us lose power? In  twenty revolutionary &#8216;power principles&#8217;, renowned psychologist Dacher  Keltner turns everything we thought we knew about influence and status  upside down, redefining power for our times.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Keltner is the  most interesting psychologist in America. It&#8217;s only a matter of time  before his ideas spread everywhere&#8217; Michael Lewis    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are the safest humans who ever lived &#8211; the statistics prove it. And yet the media tells a different story with its warnings and scare stories. How is it possible that anxiety has become the stuff of daily life?    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking, compulsively readable book, Dan Gardner shows how our flawed strategies for perceiving risk influence our lives, often with unforeseen and sometimes-tragic consequences. He throws light on our paranoia about everything from paedophiles to terrorism and reveals how the most significant threats are actually the mundane risks to which we pay little attention.    </p>
<p>                    Speaking to psychologists and scientists, as well as looking at the influence of the media and politicians, Gardner uncovers one of the central puzzles of our time: why are the safest people in history living in a culture of fear?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A beautifully written, eminently readable and uniquely important challenge to conventional wisdom&#8217; J. D. Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy    </p>
<p>                    Never has our society felt more divided.     </p>
<p>                    In Political Tribes, Amy Chua diagnoses the cause of our current political discord: tribalism. In many parts of the world, the group identities that matter most &#8211; the ones that people will kill and die for &#8211; are ethnic, religious, sectarian or clan-based. Time and time again our blindness to tribalism has undermined our foreign policy.    </p>
<p>                    At home, we have recently witnessed the rise of identity politics, a movement that encourages us to define ourselves against, and thereby exclude, others. The shock results of the US election and the Brexit referendum show that tribalism is a social truth that we ignore at our peril. When people are defined by their differences to each other, extremism becomes the common ground, and the grand ideals of democracy have a hard time competing with a more primal need to belong.    </p>
<p>                    If we are to transcend our political tribes, we must rediscover a broader, more nuanced unity that acknowledges the reality of our group differences. Insightful, challenging and provocative, Amy Chua&#8217;s groundbreaking book could not be more timely.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the crossroads of psychology and religion, this catalyzing work applied the scientific method to a field abounding in abstract theory. William James believed that individual religious experiences, rather than the precepts of organized religions, were the backbone of the world&#8217;s religious life. His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences &#8211; all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E. Marty discusses how James&#8217;s pluralistic view of religion led to his remarkable tolerance of extreme forms of religious behaviour, his challenging, highly original theories, and his welcome lack of pretension in all of his observations on the individual and the divine.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnificent opus &#8230; extraordinary, spellbinding &#8230; this book does what no other on autism has done&#8217; Ann Bauer, Washington Post    </p>
<p>                    *Pulitzer finalist 2017*    </p>
<p>                    The stunning history of autism as it has been discovered and felt by parents, children and doctors    </p>
<p>                    Nearly seventy-five years ago, Donald Triplett of Forest, Mississippi became the first child diagnosed with autism. In a Different Key tells the extraordinary story of the world his diagnosis created &#8211; a riveting human drama that takes us across continents and through some of the great social movements of the twentieth century.    </p>
<p>                    The history of autism is, above all, the story of families fighting for a place in the world for their children. It is the story of women like Ruth Sullivan, who rebelled against a medical establishment that blamed &#8220;refrigerator mothers&#8221; for causing autism, of fathers who pushed scientists to dig harder for treatments, of parents who forced schools to accept their children. But many others played starring roles too: doctors like Leo Kanner, who pioneered our understanding of autism, scientists who sparred over how to treat autism, and those with autism, like Temple Grandin and Ari Ne&#8217;eman, who explained their inner worlds and championed a philosophy of &#8216;neurodiversity&#8217;.     </p>
<p>                    This is also a story of fierce controversy: from the question of whether there is truly an autism &#8216;epidemic&#8217;, and whether vaccines played a part in it, to scandals involving &#8216;facilitated communication&#8217;, one of many treatments that have proved to be blind alleys. And there are dark turns too: we learn about experimenters feeding LSD to children with autism, or shocking them with electricity to change their behaviour; and the authors reveal, for the first time, that Hans Asperger, discoverer of the syndrome named after him, may have cooperated with the Nazis in sending disabled children to their deaths.    </p>
<p>                    By turns intimate and panoramic, In a Different Key takes us on a journey from an era when families were shamed and children were condemned to institutions, to one in which parents and people with autism push not simply for inclusion, but for a new understanding of autism: as difference rather than disability.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;With deft prose and page after page of keen insights, Heffernan shows why we close our eyes to facts that threaten our families, our livelihood, and our self-image&#8211;and, even better, she points the way out of the darkness.&#8221; &#8211;Daniel H. Pink  In the tradition of Malcolm Gladwell and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Margaret Heffernan&#8217;s Willful Blindness is a tour de force on human behavior that will open your eyes. Why, after every major accident and blunder, do we look back and say, How could we have been so blind? Why do some people see what others don&#8217;t? And how can we change? Drawing on studies by psychologists and neuroscientists, and from interviews with business leaders, whistleblowers, and white collar criminals, distinguished businesswoman and writer Margaret Heffernan examines the phenomenon of willful blindness, exploring the reasons that individuals and groups are blind to impending personal tragedies, corporate collapses, engineering failures-even crimes against humanity. We turn a blind eye in order to feel safe, to avoid conflict, to reduce anxiety, and to protect prestige. But greater understanding leads to solutions, and Heffernan shows how-by challenging our biases, encouraging debate, discouraging conformity, and not backing away from difficult or complicated problems-we can be more mindful of what&#8217;s going on around us and be proactive instead of reactive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you ever think you&#8217;re the only one making any sense? Or tried to reason with your partner with disastrous results? Do long, rambling answers drive you crazy? Or does your colleague&#8217;s abrasive manner get your back up?     </p>
<p>                    You are not alone. After a disastrous meeting with a highly successful entrepreneur, who was genuinely convinced he was &#8216;surrounded by idiots&#8217;, communication expert and bestselling author, Thomas Erikson dedicated himself to understanding how people function and why we often struggle to connect with certain types of people.    </p>
<p>                    Originally published in Swedish in 2014 as Omgiven Av Idioter, Erikson&#8217;s Surrounded by Idiots is already an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide, of which over 750,000 copies have been sold in Sweden alone. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with &#8211; in and out of the office &#8211;  based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way(s) we speak and share information.     </p>
<p>                    Erikson will help you understand yourself better, hone communication and social skills, handle conflict with confidence, improve dynamics with your boss and team, and get the best out of the people you deal with and manage. He also shares simple tricks on body language, improving written communication and advice on when to back away or when to push on, and when to speak up or indeed shut up. Packed with &#8216;aha!&#8217; and &#8216;oh no!&#8217; moments, Surrounded by Idiots will help you understand and influence those around you, even people you currently think are beyond all comprehension.     </p>
<p>                    And with a bit of luck you can also be confident that the idiot out there isn&#8217;t you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re someone who dreams of penning a bestseller, read this book&#8217; The Week    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;What if the success of E.L.James and Dan Brown was not so random? What  if there were an algorithm that could pick out the bestseller DNA  concealed within these books before they&#8217;re published? This is the  audacious claim made by Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers &#8230; Smart,  savvy and full of ideas&#8217; Fiona Wilson, The Times    </p>
<p>                    Girl on the Train. Fifty Shades. The Goldfinch. Why do some books capture the whole world&#8217;s attention? In The Bestseller Code, Archer and Jockers boldly claim that not only can mega-hits be explained and identified &#8211; but they&#8217;ve built the algorithm to prove it. Using cutting-edge text mining techniques, they have developed a model that analyses theme, plot, style and character  to explain why some books resonate more than others with readers. Provocative, entertaining, and ground-breaking, The Bestseller Code explores the hidden patterns at work in the biggest hits and, more importantly, the real reasons we love to read.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Non-formulaic, eye-opening, deeply-researched &#8211; and really worth your time&#8217; GQ    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;When a story captures the imagination of millions, that&#8217;s magic. Can  you qualify magic? Archer and Jockers just may have done so&#8217; Sylvia Day,  no.1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The claims are eye-grabbing . . . and also highly plausible&#8217; Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, Spectator    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Years of experience as a magician taught Tim David that real magic is all about words, and the way they influence the minds of the audience. What sets a professional magician apart from an amateur are people skills like communication, influence, and engagement-skills that are also effective in the workplace. By applying seven &#8220;magic&#8221; words in a business setting, David offers tools for effective and persuasive communication.    </p>
<p>                    You will learn:    </p>
<p>                      The secret word that Harvard psychologists discovered is the key to unlocking human motivation<br />
                      How one very special word (spoken only inside your mind) mysteriously has a profound positive impact on those around you<br />
                      The number one mistake that managers make during 1-on-1&#8217;s, and the one simple word that can fix it all<br />
                      What Dale Carnegie dubs &#8220;the sweetest sound in any language&#8221;<br />
                      How one tiny word can instantly change someone&#8217;s mind for the better<br />
                      The single word that an in-depth study of thousands of hours of call center recordings revealed as the quickest way to reduce differences and calm people down<br />
                      How the infamous &#8220;But Eraser&#8221; works and why so many people mess it up<br />
                      The REAL magic behind the word &#8220;thanks&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    The seven words:<br />
                      Magic Word #1 &#8211; Because<br />
                      Magic Word #2 &#8211; &#8220;Name&#8221;<br />
                      Magic Word #3 &#8211; If<br />
                      Magic Word #4 &#8211; But<br />
                      Magic Word #5 &#8211; Absolutely<br />
                      Magic Word #6 &#8211; Thanks<br />

<p>                     Dr. Joseph Annibali has treated thousands of people with overloaded, overstimulated brains. Some people describe their brain as being &#8220;in chaos&#8221;; others feel that their brain is &#8220;on fire.&#8221; But whether they are ultimately diagnosed with anxiety, disabling OCD, depression, bipolar disorder, or even substance abuse, the underlying problem is a Too-Busy Brain, a great irritant that interferes with attention, concentration, focus, mood, and often much more. It may even be a sign of undetected damage to either the brain or the body itself. But through practical strategies, understandable explanations, and prescriptive mind-management techniques, Dr. Annibali will help readers finally reclaim their brains and get back in control of their lives.</p>

This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>
