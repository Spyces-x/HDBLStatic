Charlamagne Tha God-the self-proclaimed &#8220;Prince of Pissing People Off,&#8221; cohost of Power 105.1&#8217;s The Breakfast Club, and &#8220;the most important voice in hip-hop&#8221;-shares his eight principles for unlocking your God-given privilege.    </p>
<p>                    In Black Privilege, Charlamagne presents his often controversial and always brutally honest insights on how living an authentic life is the quickest path to success. This journey to truth begins in the small town of Moncks Corner, South Carolina, and leads to New York and headline-grabbing interviews and insights from celebrities like Kanye West, Kevin Hart, Malcolm Gladwell, Lena Dunham, Jay Z, and Hillary Clinton.    </p>
<p>                    Black Privilege lays out all the great wisdom Charlamagne&#8217;s been given from many mentors, and tells the uncensored story of how he turned around his troubled early life by owning his (many) mistakes and refusing to give up on his dreams, even after his controversial opinions got him fired from several on-air jobs. These life-learned principles include:    </p>
<p>                    -There are no losses in life, only lessons<br />
                     -Give people the credit they deserve for being stupid-starting with yourself<br />
                     -It&#8217;s not the size of the pond but the hustle in the fish<br />
                     -When you live your truth, no one can use it against you<br />
                     -We all have privilege, we just need to access it    </p>
<p>                    By combining his own story with bold advice and his signature commitment to honesty no matter the cost, Charlamagne hopes Black Privilege will empower you to live your own truth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES-BESTSELLING BOOK BY ONE OF BRITAIN&#8217;S BEST-LOVED COMIC WRITERS</p>
<p>                    **Pre-order now: David Mitchell&#8217;s new book Dishonesty is the Second-best Policy**</p>
<p>                    There are many aspects of modern life that trouble award-winning comedian David Mitchell, such as: </p>
<p>                    Why is every film or TV programme a sequel or a remake? </p>
<p>                    Why are people so f***ing hung up about swearing? </p>
<p>                    Why do the asterisks in that sentence make it ok? </p>
<p>                    Why do so many people want to stop other people doing things, and how can they be stopped from stopping them?</p>
<p>                    Join Mitchell on a tour of the absurdities of our times &#8211; from Ryanair to Richard III, Downton Abbey to phone etiquette, UKIP to hotdogs made of cats. Funny, provocative and shot through with refreshing amounts of common sense, Thinking About It Only Makes It Worse celebrates and commiserates on the state of things in our not entirely glorious modern world.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Mitchell is an exceptionally clever, eloquent and spot-on commentator. We should be grateful for him.&#8217; Daily Mail, Books of the Year</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The #1 New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    **A hilarious, thoughtful, and in-depth exploration of the pleasures and perils of modern romance from Aziz Ansari, the Emmy-award winning star of Master of None and one of this generation&#8217;s sharpest comedic voices**    </p>
<p>                    In the old days, most people would find a decent person who lived in their village or neighbourhood, and after deciding they weren&#8217;t a murderer, get married and have kids &#8211; all by the age of 22.     </p>
<p>                    Now we spend years of our lives searching for our perfect soul mate and, thanks to dating apps, mobile phones and social media, we have more romantic options than ever before in human history. Yet we also have to confront strange new dilemmas, such as what to think when someone is too busy to reply to a text but has time to post a photo of their breakfast on Instagram. And if we have so many more options, why aren&#8217;t people any less frustrated?     </p>
<p>                    For years, American comedian Aziz Ansari has been aiming his comic insight at dating and relationships, and in Modern Romance, he teams up with award-winning sociologist Eric Klinenberg to investigate love in the age of technology. They enlisted some of the world&#8217;s leading social scientists, conducted hundreds of interviews, analyzed the behavioural data, and researched dating cultures from Tokyo to Buenos Aires to New York City. The result is an unforgettable picture of modern love, combining Ansari&#8217;s irreverent humour with cutting-edge social science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Anyone seeking to influence others must first know their own story, and how to tell it properly. Whether you&#8217;re proposing a risky new venture, trying to close a deal, or leading a charge against injustice, you have a story to tell. Tell it well and you will create a shared experience with your listeners that can have profound results.    </p>
<p>                    In this modern classic, Annette Simmons reminds us that the oldest tool of influence is also the most powerful. Fully revised and updated to account for new technology and social media, along with two new chapters on the role of stories in the development of civilization and how to adjust your story to your specific goal, Simmons showcases over a hundred examples of effective storytelling drawn from the front lines of business and government, as well as myths, fables, and parables from around the world. Whether writing a screenplay, or announcing a corporate reorganization, Simmons illustrates how story can be used in ways that cold facts, bullet points, and directives can&#8217;t. These stories, combined with practical storytelling techniques, show anyone how to become a more effective communicator and achieve their goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A five-time Moth GrandSLAM winner and bestselling novelist shows how to tell a great story &#8212; and why doing so matters.    </p>
<p>                     Whether we realize it or not, we are always telling stories. On a first date or job interview, at a sales presentation or therapy appointment, with family or friends, we are constantly narrating events and interpreting emotions and actions. In this compelling book, storyteller extraordinaire Matthew Dicks presents wonderfully straightforward and engaging tips and techniques for constructing, telling, and polishing stories that will hold the attention of your audience (no matter how big or small). He shows that anyone can learn to be an appealing storyteller, that everyone has something &#8220;storyworthy&#8221; to express, and, perhaps most important, that the act of creating and telling a tale is a powerful way of understanding and enhancing your own life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A terrific and timely book that makes a compelling case for fundamentally rethinking how your business communicates. Recommended!&#8221;<br />
                    -Jay Baer, founder of Convince &#038; Convert and author of Hug Your Haters    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Once upon a time, storytelling was confused with talking at people. Not anymore. Shane and Joe are your narrators in a journey that will transform how you talk to other human beings to be more believable, relevant, compelling and unforgettable.&#8221;<br />
                    -Brian Solis, experience architect, digital anthropologist, best-selling author    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Shane Snow and Joe Lazauskas spend the overwhelming majority of their time thinking, writing, and theorizing about brand storytelling &#8211; so you don&#8217;t have to. They&#8217;re smart and they know this topic inside out (and sideways). Read their book. While I can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll rise to Shane and Joe&#8217;s ridiculously obsessive level, you will be infinitely better prepared to tell your own brand&#8217;s story. Promise!&#8221;<br />
                    -Rebecca Lieb, Analyst, Author &#038; Advisor    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The Contently team understands the power of story, and how to craft and spread a great narrative, like no other. In an era where brand, design, and mission are a competitive advantage for every business, Contently underscores the importance of stories and how they transform companies and industries.&#8221;<br />
                    -Scott Belsky, Entrepreneur, Investor, &#038; Author (Founder of Behance, bestselling author of Making Ideas Happen)    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a better way to illustrate the power of story telling than by telling great stories. This book should be required reading not just by those with content in their titles, but by anyone in Marketing AND Sales. Then, when you&#8217;re done, give it to your CEO to read&#8230; but make sure you get it back, because I guarantee you&#8217;ll refer to it more than once.&#8221;<br />
                    -Shawna Dennis, Senior Marketing Leader    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Neuroscience, algorithms, illustrations, personal anecdotes and good, old-fashioned empathy: This entertaining and informative tome journeys to the core of how we communicate and pushes us, as marketers and humans, to do it better, &#8220;speeding the reader through and leaving us wanting more.&#8221;<br />
                    -Ann Hynek, VP of global content marketing at Morgan Stanley    </p>
<p>                     Transform your business through the power of storytelling.    </p>
<p>                     Content strategists Joe Lazauskas and Shane Snow offer an insider&#8217;s guide to transforming your business-and all the relationships that matter to it-through the art and science of telling great stories.    </p>
<p>                     Smart businesses today understand the need to use stories to better connect with the people they care about. But few know how to do it well. In The Storytelling Edge, the strategy minds behind Contently, the world renowned content marketing technology company, reveal their secrets that have helped award-winning brands to build relationships with millions of advocates and customers.    </p>
<p>                     Join as they dive into the neuroscience of storytelling, the elements of powerful stories, and methodologies to grow businesses through engaging and accountable content.    </p>
<p>                     With The Storytelling Edge you will discover how leaders and workers can craft the powerful stories that not only build brands and engage customers, but also build relationships and make people care-in work and in life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn the science and master the art of telling a great story Stories for Work walks you through the science of storytelling, revealing the secrets behind great storytellers and showing you how to master the art of storytelling in business. Stories hold a unique place in our psyche, and the right story at the right time can be a game-changer in business; whether tragedy, triumph, tension or transition, a good story can captivate the listener and help you achieve your goals.
