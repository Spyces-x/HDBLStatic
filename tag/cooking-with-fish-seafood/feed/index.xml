<p>                    Everything you never knew about sushi&#8211; its surprising origins, the colorful lives of its chefs, and the bizarre behavior of the creatures that compose it    </p>
<p>                    Trevor Corson takes us behind the scenes at America&#8217;s first sushi-chef training academy, as eager novices strive to master the elusive art of cooking without cooking. He delves into the biology and natural history of the edible creatures of the sea, and tells the fascinating story of an Indo-Chinese meal reinvented in nineteenth-century Tokyo as a cheap fast food. He reveals the pioneers who brought sushi to the United States and explores how this unlikely meal is exploding into the American heartland just as the long-term future of sushi may be unraveling.    </p>
<p>                    The Story of Sushi is at once a compelling tale of human determination and a delectable smorgasbord of surprising food science, intrepid reporting, and provocative cultural history.</p>
