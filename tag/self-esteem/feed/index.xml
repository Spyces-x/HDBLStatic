										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The monumental bestseller Quiet has been recast in a new edition that empowers introverted kids and teens      </p>
<p>                     Susan Cain sparked a worldwide conversation when she published Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#8217;t Stop Talking. With her inspiring book, she permanently changed the way we see introverts and the way introverts see themselves.     </p>
<p>                     The original book focused on the workplace, and Susan realized that a version for and about kids was also badly needed. This book is all about kids&#8217; world&#8211;school, extracurriculars, family life, and friendship. You&#8217;ll read about actual kids who have tackled the challenges of not being extroverted and who have made a mark in their own quiet way. You&#8217;ll hear Susan Cain&#8217;s own story, and you&#8217;ll be able to make use of the tips at the end of each chapter. There&#8217;s even a guide at the end of the book for parents and teachers.     </p>
<p>                     This insightful, accessible, and empowering book, illustrated with amusing comic-style art, will be eye-opening to extroverts and introverts alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how TEN habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour &#8211; the NEW book from the creator of the chimp management mind model and author of the million copy selling The Chimp Paradox .    </p>
<p>                    My Hidden Chimp is an effective and powerful new educational book that offers parents, teachers and carers some ideas and thoughts on how to help children to develop healthy habits for life. The science behind the habits is discussed in a practical way with exercises and activities to help children think the habits through and start putting them into practice. The neuroscience of the mind is simplified for children to understand and then use to their advantage.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Steve Peters explains neuroscience in a straightforward and intuitive way &#8211; offering up 10 simple habits that we as adults and children should have in our arsenal to deal with everyday life.    </p>
<p>                    They include:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Smiling<br />
                    &#8211; The importance of talking through your feelings<br />
                    &#8211; Learning how to say sorry<br />
                    &#8211; Knowing how to ask for help    </p>
<p>                    By also explaining the developing &#8216;chimp&#8217; brain in children, he shows us how 10 habits can help children to understand and manage their emotions and behaviour. These 10 habits should and can be retained for life.    </p>
<p>                    This is an important and another groundbreaking new book from the bestselling author of The Chimp Paradox and the creator of the chimp management mind model.</p>
