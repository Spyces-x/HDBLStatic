										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distrust That Particular Flavor &#8211; an acclaimed nonfiction collection by William Gibson, bestselling author of Neuromancer</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The future&#8217;s already here: it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed&#8217;</p>
<p>                    William Gibson was writing fiction when he predicted the internet. And as his stories bled into reality so he became one of the first to report on the real-world consequences of cyberspace&#8217;s growth and development.</p>
<p>                    Now, with the dust settling on the first internet revolution, comes Gibson&#8217;s first collection of non-fiction &#8211; essays from the technological and cultural frontiers of this new world. </p>
<p>                    Covering a variety of subjects, they include:</p>
<p>                    &#8211; Metrophagy &#8211; the Art and Science of Digesting Great Cities<br />
                    &#8211; An account of obsession in &#8216;the world&#8217;s attic&#8217; &#8211; eBay<br />
                    &#8211; Reasons why &#8216;The Net is a Waste of Time&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Singapore as &#8216;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; A primer on Japan, our default setting for the future </p>
<p>                    These and many other pieces, collected for the first time in Distrust that Particular Flavour, are studded with revealing autobiographical fragments and map the development of Gibson&#8217;s acute perceptions about modern life. Readers of Neal Stephenson, Ray Bradbury and Iain M. Banks will love this book.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Gibson is a prophet and a satirist, a black comedian and an astounding architect of cool. He&#8217;s also responsible for much of the world we live in&#8217; Spectator</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Part-detective story, part-cultural snapshot &#8230; all bound by Gibson&#8217;s pin-sharp prose&#8217; Arena</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Roughly half the world&#8217;s population speaks languages derived from a shared linguistic source known as Proto-Indo-European. But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, and how did they manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization. Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia&#8217;s steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior&#8217;s chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange.<br />
                    He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper mining, warfare, and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding. The Horse, the Wheel, and Language solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries&#8211;the source of the Indo-European languages and English&#8211;and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tracy Kidder&#8217;s &#8220;riveting&#8221; (Washington Post) story of one company&#8217;s efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market won both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award and has become essential reading for understanding the history of the American tech industry.  Computers have changed since 1981, when The Soul of a New Machine first examined the culture of the computer revolution. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations.<br />
                    The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century. &#8220;Fascinating&#8230;A surprisingly gripping account of people at work.&#8221; &#8211;Wall Street Journal    </p>

<p>                    Now, we all sense that something has changed.

<p>                    In New Power, Jeremy Heimans and Henry Timms confront the biggest story of our age and trace how New Power is the key to understanding where we are and will prosper in the 21st Century.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on examples from business, politics, popular culture and social justice, as well as case studies of organisations like LEGO and TED, they explain the forces that are changing the course of our age.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of Who Owns the Future, an MIT Media Lab scientist imagines how everyday objects can intuit our needs, improve our lives, and form &#8220;an ethereal interconnection of gadgets and human desires that&#8230;will pervade our lives in the very near future&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal).     </p>
<p>                    We are now standing at the precipice of the next transformative development, a world in which technology becomes more human. Soon, connected technology will be embedded in hundreds of everyday objects we already use: our cars, wallets, watches, umbrellas, even our trash cans. These objects will respond to our needs, come to know us, and even learn to think ahead on our behalf. David Rose calls these devices&#8211;which are just beginning to creep into the marketplace&#8211;Enchanted Objects.     </p>
<p>                     In Rose&#8217;s vision of the future, technology atomizes, combining itself with the objects that make up the very fabric of daily living. Such innovations will be woven into the background of our environment, enhancing human relationships, channeling desires for omniscience, long life, and creative expression. The enchanted objects of fairy tales and science fiction will enter real life.     </p>
<p>                     Groundbreaking, timely, and provocative, Enchanted Objects is a &#8220;delightful&#8221; (The New York Times) blueprint for a better future, where efficient solutions come hand in hand with technology that delights our senses. It is essential reading for designers, technologists, entrepreneurs, business leaders, and anyone who wishes to take a glimpse into the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first person who will live to be 150 years old has already been born.<br />
                    The screen that we peer into will soon be within us.<br />
                    We could soon be taking happiness pills before breakfast.<br />

<p>                    This is a new world we are walking into. And the man who began this journey won&#8217;t be the man who ends this journey. Where Will Man Take Us? explores the changes technology is bringing about in us-as a society and as a species. What will the next generation turn into, what will it be like, how will the new Adam and Eve live and love?<br />
                    In this book, Atul Jalan tackles nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, quantum computing and genetics, seamlessly weaving the future of technology with the changing dynamics of human love, morality and ethics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Trenchant, expansive essays on the cultural consequences of ongoing, all-permeating technological innovation    </p>
<p>                    In 1994, Sven Birkerts published The Gutenberg Elegies, his celebrated rallying cry to resist the oncoming digital advances, especially those that might affect the way we read literature and experience art&#8211;the very cultural activities that make us human.<br />
                     After two decades of rampant change, Birkerts has allowed a degree of everyday digital technology into his life. He refuses to use a smartphone, but communicates via e-mail and spends some time reading online. In Changing the Subject, he examines the changes that he observes in himself and others&#8211;the distraction when reading on the screen; the loss of personal agency through reliance on GPS and one-stop information resources; an increasing acceptance of &#8220;hive&#8221; behaviors. &#8220;An unprecedented shift is underway,&#8221; he argues, and &#8220;this transformation is dramatically accelerated and more psychologically formative than any previous technological innovation.&#8221; He finds solace in engagement with art, particularly literature, and he brilliantly describes the countering energy available to us through acts of sustained attention, even as he worries that our increasingly mediated existences are not conducive to creativity.<br />
                     It is impossible to read Changing the Subject without coming away with a renewed sense of what is lost by our wholesale acceptance of digital innovation and what is regained when we immerse ourselves in a good book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach a great turning point in history when technology is poised to redefine what it means to be human, The Fourth Age offers fascinating insight into AI, robotics, and their extraordinary implications for our species. &#8220;If you only read just one book about the AI revolution, make it this one&#8221; (John Mackey, cofounder and CEO, Whole Foods Market).     </p>
<p>                    In The Fourth Age, Byron Reese makes the case that technology has reshaped humanity just three times in history: 100,000 years ago, we harnessed fire, which led to language; 10,000 years ago, we developed agriculture, which led to cities and warfare; 5,000 years ago, we invented the wheel and writing, which lead to the nation state.    </p>
<p>                    We are now on the doorstep of a fourth change brought about by two technologies: AI and robotics. &#8220;Timely, highly informative, and certainly optimistic&#8221; (Booklist), The Fourth Age provides an essential background on how we got to this point, and how-rather than what-we should think about the topics we&#8217;ll soon all be facing: machine consciousness, automation, changes in employment, creative computers, radical life extension, artificial life, AI ethics, the future of warfare, superintelligence, and the implications of extreme prosperity.    </p>
<p>                    By asking questions like &#8220;Are you a machine?&#8221; and &#8220;Could a computer feel anything?&#8221;, Reese leads you through a discussion along the cutting edge in robotics and AI, and provides a framework by which we can all understand, discuss, and act on the issues of the Fourth Age and how they&#8217;ll transform humanity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tear down the obstacles to creative innovation in your organization    </p>
<p>                     Unlocking Creativity is an exploration of the creative process and how organizations can clear the way for innovation. In many organizations, creative individuals face stubborn resistance to new ideas. Managers and executives oftentimes reject innovation and unconventional approaches due to misplaced allegiance to the status quo. Questioning established practices or challenging prevailing sentiments is frequently met with stiff resistance. In this climate of stifled creativity and inflexible adherence to conventional wisdom, potentially game-changing ideas are dismissed outright. Senior leaders claim to value creativity, yet often lack the knowledge to provide a creative framework. Unlocking Creativity offers effective methods and real-world examples of how the most successful organizations create cultures of innovation and experimentation.    </p>
<p>                     Best-selling author and scholar Michael Roberto presents a thorough investigation of organizational obstacles to creative thought. Highly relevant to the growth crises many enterprises face in today&#8217;s economic landscape, this book examines how to break barriers to spark creativity and foster new ideas. This insightful and informative work allows business executives, senior managers, and organization leaders to:    </p>
<p>                    Recognize the six organizational mindsets that impede creativity and innovation<br />
                    Learn how to tear down the barriers that obstruct the creative process<br />
                    Create an environment that allows talented people to thrive<br />
                    Encourage creative collaboration in teams throughout an organization    </p>
<p>                     Leaders do not have to conceive innovative ideas, but rather open the path for curious and creative employees within their organization. Unlocking Creativity: How to Solve Any Problem and Make the Best Decisions aids organizations in removing obstacles to the creative process and helps to form an atmosphere of imagination and innovation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in times of increasing inscrutability. Our news feeds are filled with unverified, unverifiable speculation, much of it automatically generated by anonymous software. As a result, we no longer understand what is happening around us. Underlying all of these trends is a single idea: the belief that quantitative data can provide a coherent model of the world, and the efficacy of computable information to provide us with ways of acting within it. Yet the sheer volume of information available to us today reveals less than we hope. Rather, it heralds a new Dark Age: a world of ever-increasing incomprehension.    </p>
<p>                    In his brilliant new work, leading artist and writer James Bridle offers us a warning against the future in which the contemporary promise of a new technologically assisted Enlightenment may just deliver its opposite: an age of complex uncertainty, predictive algorithms, surveillance, and the hollowing out of empathy. Surveying the history of art, technology and information systems he reveals the dark clouds that gather over discussions of the digital sublime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Lyons was Technology Editor at Newsweek Magazine for years, a magazine writer at the top of his profession. One Friday morning he received a phone call: his job no longer existed. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was unemployed and facing financial oblivion. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the nebulous role of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What could possibly go wrong?     </p>
<p>                     What follows is a hilarious and excoriating account of Dan&#8217;s time at the start-up and a revealing window onto the dysfunctional culture that prevails in a world flush with cash and devoid of experience. Filled with stories of meaningless jargon, teddy bears at meetings, push-up competitions and all-night parties, this uproarious tale is also a trenchant analysis of the dysfunctional start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them. It is a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to cash out with a fortune.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD 2019    </p>
<p>                                From one of the most important economic thinkers of our time, a brilliant and far-seeing analysis of the current populist backlash against globalization and how revitalising community can save liberal market democracy.     </p>
<p>                              Raghuram Rajan, author of the 2010 FT &#038; Goldman-Sachs Book of the Year Fault Lines, has an unparalleled vantage point onto the social and economic consequences of globalization and their ultimate effect on politics and society.     </p>
<p>                              In The Third Pillar he offers up a magnificent big-picture framework for understanding how three key forces &#8211; the economy, society, and the state &#8211; interact, why things begin to break down, and how we can find our way back to a more secure and stable plane.    </p>
<p>                              The &#8216;third pillar&#8217; of the title is society. Economists all too often understand their field as the relationship between the market and government, and leave social issues for other people. That&#8217;s not just myopic, Rajan argues; it&#8217;s dangerous. All economics is actually socioeconomics &#8211; all markets are embedded in a web of human relations, values and norms. As he shows, throughout history, technological innovations have ripped the market out of old webs and led to violent backlashes, and to what we now call populism. Eventually, a new equilibrium is reached, but it can be ugly and messy, especially if done wrong.     </p>
<p>                              Right now, we&#8217;re doing it wrong. As markets scale up, government scales up with it, concentrating economic and political power in flourishing central hubs and leaving the periphery to decompose, figuratively and even literally. Instead, Rajan offers a way to rethink the relationship between the market and civil society and argues for a return to strengthening and empowering local communities as an antidote to growing despair and unrest.    </p>
<p>                              The Third Pillar is a masterpiece of explication, a book that will be a classic of its kind for its offering of a wise, authoritative and humane explanation of the forces that have wrought such a sea change in our lives. His ultimate argument that decision-making has to be watered at the grass roots or our democracy will continue to wither is sure to be both provocative and agenda-setting across the world.</p>

<p>                                Microsoft&#8217;s CEO tells the inside story of the company&#8217;s continuing transformation, while tracing his own journey from a childhood in India to leading some of the most significant changes of the digital era.    </p>
<p>                                LONGLISTED FOR THE FT &#038; MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD    </p>
<p>                              Satya Nadella grew up in India, studied in the US and went on to become Microsoft&#8217;s third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. In Hit Refresh he offers a unique view of the transformation happening inside one of the world&#8217;s most iconic tech companies, and the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology humankind has experienced &#8211; including artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and quantum computing.    </p>
<p>                              Nadella examines how people, organisations and societies can and must transform &#8211; &#8216;hit refresh&#8217; &#8211; in their persistent quest for new energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal. Yet at its core, this book is about humans, and how one of our essential qualities &#8211; empathy &#8211; will become ever more valuable in a world where technological advancement will alter the status quo as never before.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this book, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum contribute significantly to one of the most important issues of our time &#8211; how to move forward in the Fourth Industrial Revolution&#8217; Jack Ma, Executive Chairman, Alibaba Group Holding, People&#8217;s Republic of China    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s no secret that technologies are reshaping the world&#8217;s economies and societies. To manage the risks and spread the benefits, we have to act now, and in the interest of stakeholders everywhere&#8217; Andrew McAfee, Co-Founder, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, MIT, USA    </p>
<p>                    We are on the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. And this one will be unlike any other in human history.    </p>
<p>                    Characterized by new technologies fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will impact all disciplines, economies and industries &#8211; and it will do so at an unprecedented rate. World Economic Forum data predicts that by 2025 we will see: commercial use of nanomaterials 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than human hair; the first transplant of a 3D-printed liver; 10% of all cars on US roads being driverless; and much more besides.    </p>
<p>                    In The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Schwab outlines the key technologies driving this revolution, discusses the major impacts on governments, businesses, civil society and individuals, and offers bold ideas for what can be done to shape a better future for all.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are extraordinary. Leadership has to be equally extraordinary to manage the complexities of systemic change&#8217; Eric Schmidt, Technical Advisor, Alphabet, USA</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has disrupted the news industry&#8211;its relationships, forms, and business models&#8211;but it also provides no end of opportunities for improving, expanding, reimagining, and sustaining journalism. Geeks Bearing Gifts: Imagining New Futures for News is a creative, thought-provoking and entertaining exploration of the possible future(s) of news by Professor Jeff Jarvis, who leads the Tow-Knight Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism at the CUNY Graduate School of Journalism.     </p>
<p>                    To Jarvis, journalism helps a community better organize its knowledge so it can better organize itself: &#8220;But we in the field came to define ourselves less by our value and mission and more by our media and tools&#8211;ink on pulp or slick paper, sound or images over airwaves. Now we have new tools to exploit. Those tools require new skills and create new value. But at the core, we serve citizens and communities.&#8221; He offers not a single definitive future of journalism and news, but a range of possibilities depending on how journalists and journalism evolve&#8211;with the help of the &#8220;geeks&#8221; whose advances in media technology offer many opportunities for journalists and media entrepreneurs who are willing to think creatively and take risks.     </p>
<p>                    Jarvis, one of the preeminent voices on emerging forms of journalism, news delivery, and community engagement, advises many media companies, startups, and foundations. He is a former president and creative director of Advance.net, the online arm of Advance Publications, and was the creator and founding editor of Entertainment Weekly; Sunday editor and associate publisher of the New York Daily News; TV critic for TV Guide and People; a columnist on the San Francisco Examiner; and assistant city editor and reporter for the Chicago Tribune.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>TRUST IS FUNDAMENTAL TO EVERY ACTION, EVERY RELATIONSHIP, EVERY TRANSACTION    </p>
<p>                    AND IT MATTERS NOW MORE THAN EVER BEFORE&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book world-renowned trust expert Rachel Botsman reveals that we are at the tipping point of one of the biggest social transformations in human history. We might have lost faith in institutions and leaders, but millions of people travel in cars with total strangers, exchange digital currencies, or find themselves trusting a bot.     </p>
<p>                    We still trust: but not the way we used to.    </p>
<p>                    If we are to benefit from this radical shift, we must understand how trust is built, managed, lost and repaired in the digital age. In the first book to explain this new world, Botsman provides a definitive guide of this uncharted landscape &#8211; and explores what&#8217;s next for humanity.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brilliantly describes how the established trust framework is undergoing a radical transformation as digital technologies take root in every facet of our lives&#8217; Marc Benioff, Chairman &#038; CEO, Salesforce    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating and well researched&#8230;every reader will gain new insights&#8217; Geoff Mulgan, Chief Executive, Nesta    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A rare book that will cause you to think deeply about your business, your relationships and your life&#8217; Don Tapscott, bestselling author of Wikinomics and Blockchain Revolution</p>
