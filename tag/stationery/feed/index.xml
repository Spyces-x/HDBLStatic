										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I was in my class 12th, I chose economics as a subject. It&#8217;s a beautiful subject with intricate concepts and I thoroughly loved it. But there was a problem. I had to read through 569 pages of the book to understand the concepts. But only about 100 of those pages were relevant. So I made notes of these concepts for exam purpose.After the exams, these notes lay gathering dust on my shelf. And when I got selected in University of Manchester for Economics, I realised how much knowledge lays buried in our shelves and how much time it will take another student to make the same notes. Why not form it in a book for ready reference of all those students who are taking the #isc board this year?Presenting to you all #theeconomicsguide_roadtoboard which is a compendium of ready made notes of microeconomics for class 12th. No need to shift through hundreds of pages of filler material. No need to spend hours to make notes from the book. All of this is ready for you at this link.It&#8217;s time to study smart and spend your worthy time more productively. Do share with your friends and family who are giving the board exams.    </p>
