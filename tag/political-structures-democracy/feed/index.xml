										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Will set your hair on end&#8217; Telegraph, Top 50 Books of the Year</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Life is what happens between Michael Lewis books. I forgot to breathe while reading The Fifth Risk&#8217; Michael Hofmann, TLS, Books of the Year</p>
<p>                    The phenomenal new book from the international bestselling author of The Big Short</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The election happened &#8230; And then there was radio silence.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    The   morning after Trump was elected president, the people who ran the US   Department of Energy &#8211; an agency that deals with some of the most   powerful risks facing humanity &#8211; waited to welcome the incoming   administration&#8217;s transition team. Nobody appeared. Across the US   government, the same thing happened: nothing.</p>
<p>                    People don&#8217;t  notice  when stuff goes right. That is the stuff government does. It  manages  everything that underpins our lives from funding free school  meals, to  policing rogue nuclear activity, to predicting extreme  weather events.  It steps in where private investment fears to tread,  innovates and  creates knowledge, assesses extreme long-term risk. </p>
<p>                    And now, government is under attack. By its own leaders.</p>
<p>                    In The Fifth Risk,   Michael Lewis reveals the combustible cocktail of wilful ignorance and   venality that is fuelling the destruction of a country&#8217;s fabric. All  of  this, Lewis shows, exposes America and the world to the biggest risk  of  all. It is what you never learned that might have saved you.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Superb, hugely enjoyable &#8230; a spirited examination of the hubris and  hypocrisy of the super-rich who claim they are helping the world&#8217; Aditya  Chakrabortty, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    What explains the spreading backlash against the global elite? In this revelatory investigation, Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, showing how the elite follow a &#8216;win-win&#8217; logic, fighting for equality and justice any way they can &#8211; except ways that threaten their position at the top.     </p>
<p>                    But why should our gravest problems be solved by consultancies, technology companies and corporate-sponsored charities instead of public institutions and elected officials? Why should we rely on scraps from the winners? Trenchant and gripping, this is an indispensable guide and call to action for elites and citizens alike.    </p>

<p>                    &#8216;A sort of survival book, a sort of symptom-diagnosis manual in terms of losing your democracy and what tyranny and authoritarianism look like up close&#8217; Rachel Maddow    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;These 128 pages are a brief primer in every important thing we might have learned from the history of the last century, and all that we appear to have forgotten&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                     History does not repeat, but it does instruct.    </p>
<p>                     In the twentieth century, European democracies collapsed into fascism, Nazism and communism. These were movements in which a leader or a party claimed to give voice to the people, promised to protect them from global existential threats, and rejected reason in favour of myth. European history shows us that societies can break, democracies can fall, ethics can collapse, and ordinary people can find themselves in unimaginable circumstances.    </p>
<p>                     History can familiarise, and it can warn. Today, we are no wiser than the Europeans who saw democracy yield to totalitarianism in the twentieth century. But when the political order seems imperilled, our advantage is that we can learn from their experience to resist the advance of tyranny.    </p>
<p>                     Now is a good time to do so.</p>

<p>                    What happens when you take on the European establishment?     </p>
<p>                    Read as world-famous, provocative economist, and former Greece finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, blows the lid on his battle with EU officials over the Greek debt crisis.     </p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                              Varoufakis sparked one of the most spectacular and controversial battles in recent political history with his attempt to renegotiate Greece&#8217;s relationship with the European Union. Yet despite the mass support of the Greek people, and simple logic of his arguments, he succeeded only in provoking the fury of Europe&#8217;s political, financial and media elite.<br />
                                                                                                                                                                                          Exposing the real business taking place behind the EU&#8217;s closed doors, Varoufakis reveals all in this fearless, personal account. Adults In The Room is an extraordinary tale of brinkmanship, hypocrisy, collusion and betrayal that will shake the European and economic establishment to its foundations.     </p>
<p>                    Varoufakis is sending out an urgent wake-up call to renew European democracy before it is too late.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A provocative, timely account of the changing face of jounalism from a pioneer of the new-media revolution.    For a long time, media organisations have controlled the news, treating their audiences as products for advertisers.       Yet as journalism has moved online and behind paywalls, the public is demanding more say in how the news is created.       They are using blogs, Twitter, and Facebook to share stories, and selecting their sources to create their own &#8216;front page&#8217;.   In this lively, biting critique, media commentator Tim Dunlop explores the rise of the audience, and how unprepared the mainstream media has been for this changing balance of power.       Drawing on his experiences as prominent political blogger, he argues that the future of meaningful journalism &#8211; the sort we need in order to be informed citizens &#8211; will increasingly rely on journalists and editors taking the audience into their confidence and working with them, rather than against them.   The New Front Page is a passionate plea on behalf of those tired of being talked down to by the fourth estate.       Perceptive and illuminating, it asks audiences and media to work together to hold the powerful to account, and to produce the sort of news and analysis that enriches public debate.   &#8216;A fascinating account of how digital technology has changed Australian media forever.&#8217;       Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief of The Guardian Australia   &#8216;An essential guide to understanding our insurgent new media.&#8217;       Lindsay Tanner, author of Sideshow   &#8216;Dunlop writes with humour, passion, and insight.&#8217;       Gay Alcorn, journalist</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The greatest obstacle to sound economic policy is not entrenched special interests or rampant lobbying, but the popular misconceptions, irrational beliefs, and personal biases held by ordinary voters. This is economist Bryan Caplan&#8217;s sobering assessment in this provocative and eye-opening book. Caplan argues that voters continually elect politicians who either share their biases or else pretend to, resulting in bad policies winning again and again by popular demand. Boldly calling into question our most basic assumptions about American politics, Caplan contends that democracy fails precisely because it does what voters want. Through an analysis of Americans&#8217; voting behavior and opinions on a range of economic issues, he makes the convincing case that noneconomists suffer from four prevailing biases: they underestimate the wisdom of the market mechanism, distrust foreigners, undervalue the benefits of conserving labor, and pessimistically believe the economy is going from bad to worse.<br />
                    Caplan lays out several bold ways to make democratic government work better&#8211;for example, urging economic educators to focus on correcting popular misconceptions and recommending that democracies do less and let markets take up the slack. The Myth of the Rational Voter takes an unflinching look at how people who vote under the influence of false beliefs ultimately end up with government that delivers lousy results. With the upcoming presidential election season drawing nearer, this thought-provoking book is sure to spark a long-overdue reappraisal of our elective system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why our democracies need urgent reform, before it&#8217;s too late    </p>
<p>                    A generation after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the world is once again on the edge of chaos. Demonstrations have broken out from Belgium to Brazil led by angry citizens demanding a greater say in their political and economic future, better education, heathcare and living standards. The bottom line of this outrage is the same; people are demanding their governments do more to improve their lives faster, something which policymakers are unable to deliver under conditions of anaemic growth. Rising income inequality and a stagnant economy are threats to both the developed and the developing world, and leaders can no longer afford to ignore this gathering storm.    </p>
<p>                    In Edge of Chaos, Dambisa Moyo sets out the new political and economic challenges facing the world, and the specific, radical solutions needed to resolve these issues and reignite global growth. Dambisa enumerates the four headwinds of demographics, inequality, commodity scarcity and technological innovation that are driving social and economic unrest, and argues for a fundamental retooling of democratic capitalism to address current problems and deliver better outcomes in the future. In the twenty-first century, a crisis in one country can quickly become our own, and fragile economies produce a fragile international community. Edge of Chaos is a warning for advanced and emerging nations alike: we must reverse the dramatic erosion in growth, or face the consequences of a fragmented and unstable global future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>IAN BREMMER WAS NAMED LINKEDIN&#8217;S #1 TOP INFLUENCER in 2017    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Required reading to help repair a world in pieces and build a world at peace&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary General     </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Ian Bremmer is provocative, controversial, and always intelligent about the state of the world, which he knows so well&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Christine Lagarde, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund     </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    From Brexit, to Donald Trump, to extremist parties in Europe and the developing world, populism has dominated recent headlines.     </p>
<p>                    But what explains the rise of leaders who stoke nationalist anger in their countries, from Le Pen to Erdogan? How long will the populist wave last? Who will be the winners and losers in this climate, and how can we defend the values of democracy, free trade and international cooperation?     </p>
<p>                    No one is better suited to explore these questions than Ian Bremmer, the CEO of the Eurasia Group and acclaimed Time magazine columnist. Analysing the social, economic and technological forces fuelling this new wave of populism, Bremmer explains why we&#8217;re witnessing a rejection of the democratic, global, cosmopolitan trends of the late 20th century. Us vs. Them is a definitive guide to navigating the shifting political landscape, for businesses looking to weather and survive the populist storm.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Global politics is a jungle today. Thank goodness Ian Bremmer can be your guide&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; David Miliband, president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A masterful analysis of why global crashed and populism soared&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Adam Grant, author of Give and Take, and Originals and Option B with Sheryl Sandberg</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>** THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER**<br />
                    The never-before-told inside story of the Steele Dossier and the Trump-Russia investigation    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;The best procedural yet written about the discovery of Trump&#8217;s Russia ties&#8217; New York Times    </p>
<p>                    In the autumn of 2015, the founders of the Washington-based intelligence firm Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, were hired by a republican client to look into the records of Donald Trump. What began as a march through a mind-boggling trove of lawsuits and sketchy overseas projects soon took a darker turn, as they became the first to uncover Trump&#8217;s disturbing ties to the Kremlin and the crimes that since have plagued his presidency.     </p>
<p>                     To help them decipher this alarming evidence, they engaged the services of an old acquaintance, the former British MI6 agent and Russia expert Christopher Steele. Steele would produce the notorious dossier which disclosed that the Trump team was deeply compromised by a hostile foreign power bent on disrupting the West and influencing the US presidential election.    </p>
<p>                     In Crime in Progress, the authors break their silence for the first time, chronicling their high-stakes investigation and their desperate efforts to warn both the American and British governments, the FBI and the media, to little avail &#8211; and no matter the costs. Yet when the dossier finally exploded onto the world stage after a leak, a ten-person research firm above a Starbucks in Washington was thrust into the centre of the biggest news story on the planet &#8211; a story that would lead to the Mueller report and disrupt Trump&#8217;s secret planned rapprochement with Putin&#8217;s Russia that could have re-ordered the western alliance. After four years on his trail, the authors&#8217; inescapable conclusion is that Trump is an asset of the Russian government, whether he knows it or not.     </p>
<p>                     A real-life political thriller with the makings of a modern classic, Crime in Progress is the definitive story of the pursuit of the truth about Trump and one of the greatest betrayals in American history.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I&#8217;ve read all the books on this subject &#8211; this is the one you want to read . . . I feel fairly steeped in this matter and I learned something on every page&#8217; Rachel Maddow, MSNBC     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;You don&#8217;t need to read John le Carre or Tom Clancy to find espionage thrills in Washington these days, turn over any stone in the Beltway&#8217;s secret world and you&#8217;ll observe the seething mass of conspiracy and subterfuge beneath . . . Take Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch, who have become central characters in a quite terrifying international spy thriller&#8217; Josh Glancy, Sunday Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Crisp, clear and quietly devastating&#8217; Guardian<br />
                    &#8216;Excellent, authoritative, highly readable&#8217; Irish Times    </p>
<p>                    A succinct, expert guide to how we got to Brexit    </p>
<p>                    After all the debates, manoeuvrings, recriminations and exaltations,  Brexit is upon us. But, as Kevin O&#8217;Rourke writes, Brexit did not emerge  out of nowhere: it is the culmination of events  that have been under  way for decades and have historical roots stretching back well beyond  that. Brexit has a history.    </p>
<p>                    O&#8217;Rourke, one of the leading economic  historians of his generation, explains not only how British attitudes  to Europe have evolved, but also how the EU&#8217;s history explains why it  operates as it does today &#8211; and how that history has shaped the ways in  which it has responded to Brexit. Why are the economics, the politics  and the history so tightly woven together? Crucially, he also explains  why the question of the Irish border is not just one of customs and  trade, but for the EU goes to the heart of what it is about.  The way in  which British, Irish and European histories continue to interact with  each other will shape the future of Brexit &#8211; and of the continent.    </p>
<p>                    Calm and lucid, A Short History of Brexit  rises above the usual fray of discussions to provide fresh perspectives  and understanding of the most momentous political and economic change  in Britain and the EU for decades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Read the inspiring Sunday Times bestselling memoir from the first woman, and woman of colour, to serve as Vice President of the United States.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A life story that genuinely entrances&#8217; Los Angeles Times    </p>
<p>                    The daughter of immigrants and civil rights activists, Vice President Kamala Harris was raised in a California community that cared deeply about social justice. As she rose to prominence as a political leader, her experiences would become her guiding light as she grappled with an array of complex issues and learned to bring a voice to the voiceless.    </p>
<p>                    Now, in The Truths We Hold, Harris reckons with the big challenges we face together. Drawing on the hard-won wisdom and insight from her own career and the work of those who have most inspired her, she communicates a vision of shared struggle, shared purpose, and shared values as we confront the great work of our day.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A manual for the 21st-century citizen&#8230; accessible, refreshingly critical, relevant and urgent&#8217; &#8211;  Financial Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Fascinating and deeply disturbing&#8217; &#8211; Yuval Noah Harari, Guardian Books of the Year     </p>
<p>                    In this New York Times bestseller, Cathy O&#8217;Neil, one of the first champions of algorithmic accountability, sounds an alarm on the mathematical models that pervade modern life &#8212; and threaten to rip apart our social fabric.    </p>
<p>                    We live in the age of the algorithm. Increasingly, the decisions that affect our lives &#8211; where we go to school, whether we get a loan, how much we pay for insurance &#8211; are being made not by humans, but by mathematical models. In theory, this should lead to greater fairness: everyone is judged according to the same rules, and bias is eliminated.     </p>
<p>                    And yet, as Cathy O&#8217;Neil reveals in this urgent and necessary book, the opposite is true. The models being used today are opaque, unregulated, and incontestable, even when they&#8217;re wrong. Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination. Tracing the arc of a person&#8217;s life, O&#8217;Neil exposes the black box models that shape our future, both as individuals and as a society. These &#8220;weapons of math destruction&#8221; score teachers and students, sort CVs, grant or deny loans, evaluate workers, target voters, and monitor our health.     </p>
<p>                    O&#8217;Neil calls on modellers to take more responsibility for their algorithms and on policy makers to regulate their use. But in the end, it&#8217;s up to us to become more savvy about the models that govern our lives. This important book empowers us to ask the tough questions, uncover the truth, and demand change.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The people of the Congo have suffered from a particularly brutal colonial rule, American interference after independence, decades of robbery at the hands of the dictator Mobutu and periodic warfare which continues even now in the East of the country. But, as this insightful political history makes clear, the Congolese people have not taken these multiple oppressions lying down and have fought over many years to establish democratic institutions at home and free themselves from foreign exploitation; indeed these are two aspects of a single project.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Nzongola-Ntalaja is one of his country&#8217;s leading intellectuals and his panoramic understanding of the personalities and events, as well as class, ethnic and other factors, make his book a lucid, radical and utterly unromanticized account of his countrymen&#8217;s struggle. His people&#8217;s defeat and the state&#8217;s post-colonial crisis are seen as resulting from a post-independence collapse of the anti-colonial alliance between the masses and the national leadership .    </p>
<p>                    This book is essential reading for understanding what is happening in the Congo and the Great Lakes region under the rule of the late President Kabila, and now his son. It will also stand as a milestone in how to write the modern political history of Africa.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;An ordinary person&#8217;s guide to hope. Read this book&#8217; Arundhati Roy<br />
                    &#8216;As accessible as it is brilliant&#8217; Owen Jones<br />
                    &#8216;A genuine page turner&#8217; Michelle Alexander    </p>
<p>                    Naomi Klein &#8211; award-winning journalist, bestselling author of No Logo, The Shock Doctrine and This Changes Everything, scourge of brand bullies and corporate liars &#8211; gives us the toolkit we need to survive our surreal, shocking age.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This  is a look at how we arrived at this surreal political moment, how to  keep it from getting a lot worse, and how, if we keep our heads, we can  flip the script.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Remember when love was supposed to  Trump hate? Remember when the oil companies and bankers seemed to be  running scared? What the hell happened? And what can we do about it?  Naomi Klein shows us how we got here, and how we can make things better.      </p>
<p>                    No Is Not Enough reveals, among other things, that the  disorientation we&#8217;re feeling is deliberate. That around the world, shock  political tactics are being used to generate crisis after crisis,  designed to force through policies that will destroy people, the  environment, the economy and our security. That extremism isn&#8217;t a freak  event &#8211; it&#8217;s a toxic cocktail of our times.     </p>
<p>                    From how to trash  the Trump megabrand to the art of reclaiming the populist argument,  Naomi Klein shows all of us how we can break the spell and win the world  we need. Don&#8217;t let them get away with it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Who better than Naomi to make sense of this madness, and help us find a way out? A top-of-the-stack must read&#8217; Michael Stipe    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Naomi  Klein&#8217;s new book incites us brilliantly to interweave our No with a  programmatic Yes. A manual for emancipation&#8217; Yanis Varoufakis    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Magnificent &#8230; a courageous coruscating counterspell&#8217; Junot Diaz</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; An urgent argument that America and other democracies are in peril because they have lost the will to defend the values and institutions that sustain freedom and prosperity. Now updated with a new preface!    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Epic and debate-shifting.&#8221;&#8211;David Brooks, New York Times  Only once in the last 250,000 years have humans stumbled upon a way to lift ourselves out of the endless cycle of poverty, hunger, and war that defines most of history. If democracy, individualism, and the free market were humankind&#8217;s destiny, they should have appeared and taken hold a bit earlier in the evolutionary record. The emergence of freedom and prosperity was nothing short of a miracle.  As Americans we are doubly blessed, because the radical ideas that made the miracle possible were written not just into the Constitution but in our hearts, laying the groundwork for our uniquely prosperous society. Those ideas are:  &#8211; Our rights come from God, not from the government.  <br />
                     &#8211; The government belongs to us; we do not belong to it.  <br />
                     &#8211; The individual is sovereign. We are all captains of our own souls, not bound by the circumstances of our birth.  <br />
                     &#8211; The fruits of our labors belong to us.   In the last few decades, these political virtues have been turned into vices. As we are increasingly taught to view our traditions as a system of oppression, exploitation, and privilege, the principles of liberty and the rule of law are under attack from left and right. For the West to survive, we must renew our sense of gratitude for what our civilization has given us and rediscover the ideals and habits of the heart that led us out of the bloody muck of the past&#8211;or back to the muck we will go.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE CLASSIC NATIONAL BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    A wonderful, splendid book&#8211;a book that should be read by every American, student or otherwise, who wants to understand his country, its true history, and its hope for the future. -Howard Fast    </p>
<p>                    Historian Howard Zinn&#8217;s A People&#8217;s History of the United States chronicles American history from the bottom up, throwing out the official narrative taught in schools&#8211;with its emphasis on great men in high places&#8211;to focus on the street, the home, and the workplace.    </p>
<p>                    Known for its lively, clear prose as well as its scholarly research, it is the only volume to tell America&#8217;s story from the point of view of&#8211;and in the words of&#8211;America&#8217;s women, factory workers, African-Americans, Native Americans, the working poor, and immigrant laborers. As Zinn shows, many of our country&#8217;s greatest battles&#8211;the fights for a fair wage, an eight-hour workday, child-labor laws, health and safety standards, universal suffrage, women&#8217;s rights, racial equality&#8211;were carried out at the grassroots level, against bloody resistance.     </p>
<p>                    Covering Christopher Columbus&#8217;s arrival through President Clinton&#8217;s first term, A People&#8217;s History of the United States features insightful analysis of the most important events in our history. This edition also includes an introduction by Anthony Arnove, who wrote, directed, and produced The People Speak with Zinn and who coauthored, with Zinn, Voices of a People&#8217;s History of the United States.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of TIME magazine&#8217;s All-TIME 100 Best Nonfiction Books<br />
                     One of Times Literary Supplement&#8217;s Hundred Most Influential Books Since the War<br />
                     One of National Review&#8217;s 100 Best Nonfiction Books of the Century<br />
                      One of Intercollegiate Studies Institute&#8217;s 50 Best Books of the 20th Century  How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat it poses to individual freedom? In this classic book, Milton Friedman provides the definitive statement of an immensely influential economic philosophy&#8211;one in which competitive capitalism serves as both a device for achieving economic freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom.     </p>
<p>                     First published in 1962, Friedman&#8217;s Capitalism and Freedom is one of the most significant works of economic theory ever written. Enduring in its eminence and esteem, it has sold nearly a million copies in English, has been translated into eighteen languages, and continues to inform economic thinking and policymaking around the world. This new edition includes prefaces written by Friedman for both the 1982 and 2002 reissues of the book, as well as a new foreword by Binyamin Appelbaum, lead economics writer for the New York Times editorial board.</p>
