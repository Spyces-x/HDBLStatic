										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive history of the flamboyant life of Ian Fleming and his most famous creation, James Bond.    </p>
<p>                    This new biography of Ian Fleming presents a fresh and illuminating portrayal of the iconic creator of James Bond. Oliver Buckton provides the first in-depth exploration of the entire process of Ian Fleming&#8217;s writing-from initial conception, through composition, to his involvement in the innovative publication methods of his books. He also investigates the vital impact of Fleming&#8217;s work in naval intelligence during World War Two on his later writings, especially the wartime operations he planned and executed and how they drove the plots of the James Bond novels. Buckton considers the vital role of wartime deception, disinformation, and propaganda in shaping Fleming&#8217;s later techniques and imaginative creations. Offering a radically new view of Fleming&#8217;s relationships with women, Buckton traces the role of strong, independent, and intelligent women such as Maud Russell, Phyllis Bottome, and his wife, Ann, on Fleming&#8217;s portrayal of female characters. The book concludes with a thorough analysis of the James Bond films from Eon productions, and their influence in promoting, while also distorting, the public&#8217;s recognition of Fleming&#8217;s writing.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&#8217; The prophetic words of Galadriel, addressed to Frodo as he prepared to travel from Lothlorien to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, are just as pertinent to J R R Tolkien&#8217;s own fiction. For decades, hobbits and the other fantastical creatures of Middle-earth have captured the imaginations of a fiercely loyal tribe of readers, all enhanced by the immense success of Peter Jackson&#8217;s films: first &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;, and now his new &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;. But for all Tolkien&#8217;s global fame and the familiarity of modern culture with Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Sam, the sources of the great mythmaker&#8217;s own myth-making have been neglected. Mark Atherton here explores the chief influences on Tolkien&#8217;s work: his boyhood in the West Midlands; the landscapes and seascapes which shaped his mythologies; his experiences in World War I; his interest in Scandinavian myth; his friendships, especially with the other Oxford-based Inklings; and the relevance of his themes, especially ecological themes, to the present-day.<br />
                    &#8220;There and Back Again&#8221; offers a unique guide to the varied inspirations behind Tolkien&#8217;s life and work, and sheds new light on how a legend is born.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re someone who dreams of penning a bestseller, read this book&#8217; The Week    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;What if the success of E.L.James and Dan Brown was not so random? What  if there were an algorithm that could pick out the bestseller DNA  concealed within these books before they&#8217;re published? This is the  audacious claim made by Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers &#8230; Smart,  savvy and full of ideas&#8217; Fiona Wilson, The Times    </p>
<p>                    Girl on the Train. Fifty Shades. The Goldfinch. Why do some books capture the whole world&#8217;s attention? In The Bestseller Code, Archer and Jockers boldly claim that not only can mega-hits be explained and identified &#8211; but they&#8217;ve built the algorithm to prove it. Using cutting-edge text mining techniques, they have developed a model that analyses theme, plot, style and character  to explain why some books resonate more than others with readers. Provocative, entertaining, and ground-breaking, The Bestseller Code explores the hidden patterns at work in the biggest hits and, more importantly, the real reasons we love to read.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Non-formulaic, eye-opening, deeply-researched &#8211; and really worth your time&#8217; GQ    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;When a story captures the imagination of millions, that&#8217;s magic. Can  you qualify magic? Archer and Jockers just may have done so&#8217; Sylvia Day,  no.1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The claims are eye-grabbing . . . and also highly plausible&#8217; Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, Spectator    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thought-provoking and interesting &#8230; Here is a book worth reading&#8217; David Bond, Financial Times</p>
