										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Five hundred years before the birth of Jesus, a God-realized being named Lao-tzu in ancient China dictated 81 verses, which are regarded by many as the ultimate commentary on the nature of our existence. The classic text of these 81 verses, called the Tao Te Ching or the Great Way, offers advice and guidance that is balanced, moral, spiritual, and always concerned with working for the good. In this book, Dr. Wayne W. Dyer has reviewed hundreds of translations of the Tao Te Ching and has written 81 distinct essays on how to apply the ancient wisdom of Lao-tzu to today&#8217;s modern world. This work contains the entire 81 verses of the Tao, compiled from Wayne&#8217;s researching of 10 of the most well-respected translations of text that have survived for more than 25 centuries. Each chapter is designed for actually living the Tao or the Great Way today. Some of the chapter titles are &#8216;Living with Flexibility,&#8217; &#8216;Living Without Enemies,&#8217; and &#8216;Living by Letting Go.&#8217; Each of the 81 brief chapters focuses on living the Tao and concludes with a section called &#8216;Doing the Tao Now.&#8217;<br />
                    Wayne spent one entire year reading, researching, and meditating on Lao-tzu&#8217;s messages, practicing them each day and ultimately writing down these essays as he felt Lao-tzu wanted you to know them. This is a work to be read slowly, one essay a day. As Wayne says, &#8216;This is a book that will forever change the way you look at your life, and the result will be that you&#8217;ll live in a new world aligned with nature. Writing this book changed me forever, too. I now live in accord with the natural world and feel the greatest sense of peace I&#8217;ve ever experienced. I&#8217;m so proud to present this interpretation of the Tao Te Ching, and offer the same opportunity for change that it has brought me.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Watts is the perfect guide for a course correction in life, away from materialism and its empty promise (Deepak Chopra). Here he shows us how&#8211;in an age of unprecedented anxiety&#8211;we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life.    </p>
<p>                    Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not&#8211;and cannot&#8211;know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of &#8216;writing beautifully the unwritable.'&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing from Buddhist and yogic precepts, this practical guide offers tools for becoming a better, more compassionate communicator at home, at work, and in the world     </p>
<p>                     Have you ever tried to tell someone what you want only to feel misunderstood and frustrated? Or hesitated to ask for what you needed because you didn&#8217;t want to burden the other person? Or been stuck in blame or anger that wouldn&#8217;t go away?     </p>
<p>                     Judith and Ike Lasater, long-term students of yoga and Buddhism, experienced dilemmas like these, too. Even though they had studied the yoga principle of satya (truth) and the Buddhist precept of right speech, it was not until they began practicing Marshall Rosenberg&#8217;s techniques of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) that they understood how to live satya and right speech.     </p>
<p>                     In What We Say Matters, Judith and Ike describe their journey through NVC and how speech becomes a spiritual practice based on giving and receiving with compassion&#8211;everywhere, all the time&#8211;whether at home, at work, or in the world. Their writing is deeply personal, punctuated by their recounts of trial and error, success and failure, laughter and challenge&#8211;even in writing this book! They guide you through an introduction to NVC with clear explanations, poignant examples, suggested exercises, and helpful resources. With practice, you&#8217;ll learn new ways to:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Extend empathy to yourself and others<br />
                    &#8211; Distinguish between feelings and needs<br />
                    &#8211; Make requests rather than demands<br />
                    &#8211; Choose connection over conflict<br />
                    &#8211; Create mutually satisfying outcomes</p>
