<p>                    When poor farm boy Eragon finds a polished stone in the forest, he thinks it&#8217;s a lucky discovery. Perhaps, he will be able to buy his family food for the winter.     </p>
<p>                    But, when a baby dragon hatches out of the stone, Eragon realises he&#8217;s stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.     </p>
<p>                    His simple life is shattered, and he&#8217;s thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic and power. To navigate this dark terrain, and survive his cruel king&#8217;s evil ways, he must take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders.     </p>
<p>                    Will he succeed? The fate of the Empire rests in his hands. . .    </p>
