										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now with an all-new bonus chapter&#8211;in the bestselling The House of Kennedy, &#8220;James Patterson applies his writerly skills to real-life history . . . re-telling the political clan&#8217;s rise and fall and rise again (and fall again) with novelistic style&#8221; (People).      </p>
<p>                    The Kennedys have always been a family of charismatic adventurers, raised to take risks and excel, living by the dual family mottos: &#8220;To whom much is given, much is expected&#8221; and &#8220;Win at all costs.&#8221; And they do&#8211;but at a price.     </p>
<p>                    Across decades and generations, the Kennedys have occupied a unique place in the American imagination: charmed, cursed, at once familiar and unknowable. The House of Kennedy is a revealing, fascinating account of America&#8217;s most storied family, as told by America&#8217;s most trusted storyteller.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;People keep telling me I can be a great man. I&#8217;d rather be a good one.&#8221;-John F. Kennedy, Jr. </p>
<p>                    Where were you the day John died? Like his father&#8217;s assassination and the death of Princess Diana, the tragic plane crash that took the life of JFK Jr. on July 16, 1999, is one of the defining moments of our lives &#8211; an event that moved us so deeply we will never forget where we were the day we heard the news. With good reason. No other American had lived his entire life in the spotlight &#8211; from his rambunctious toddlerhood in the Kennedy White House and heartbreaking salute to his father&#8217;s coffin to his daredevil Sexiest Man Alive bachelor days and his final years poised on the brink of fatherhood and a brilliant political career. </p>
<p>                    Now, in the manner of his other number one New York Times best seller The Day Diana Died, respected Kennedy family biographer Christopher Andersen makes The Day John Died available for the first time as an ebook. Andersen draws on important sources &#8211; many talking here for the first time &#8211; to recreate in vivid and startling detail the events leading up to that fateful night off the coast of Martha&#8217;s Vineyard. An inspiring, sympathetic, and compelling look at one of the most remarkable young men of our time, The Day John Died is more than just the definitive biography of JFK Jr. It is a bittersweet saga of triumph, love, loss, fate &#8211; and promise unfulfilled. It is the story of America&#8217;s son. </p>
<p>                    About the Author: Christopher Andersen is the critically acclaimed author of 18 New York Times best sellers, including six about the Kennedy family &#8211; Jack and Jackie, Jackie After Jack, The Day John Died, Sweet Caroline, These Few Precious Days, and The Good Son &#8211; as well as the No.1 international best seller The Day Diana Died. A former TIME Magazine contributing editor and senior editor of People, Andersen has also written for The New York Times, Life, Vanity Fair, and countless other publications.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times bestseller now updated with a new foreword</p>
<p>                    Among millions of Holocaust victims sent to Auschwitz II-Birkenau in 1944, Priska, Rachel, and Anka each passed through its infamous gates with a secret. Strangers to each other, they were newly pregnant, and facing an uncertain fate without their husbands. Alone, scared, and with so many loved ones already lost to the Nazis, these young women were privately determined to hold on to all they had left: their lives, and those of their unborn babies.</p>
<p>                    That the gas chambers ran out of Zyklon-B just after the babies were born, before they and their mothers could be exterminated, is just one of several miracles that allowed them all to survive and rebuild their lives after World War II. Born Survivors follows the mothers&#8217; incredible journey &#8211; first to Auschwitz, where they each came under the murderous scrutiny of Dr. Josef Mengele; then to a German slave labour camp where, half-starved and almost worked to death, they struggled to conceal their condition; and finally, as the Allies closed in, their hellish 17-day train journey with thousands of other prisoners to the Mauthausen death camp in Austria. Hundreds died along the way but the courage and kindness of strangers, including guards and civilians, helped save these women and their children.</p>
<p>                    Sixty-five years later, the three &#8216;miracle babies&#8217; met for the first time at Mauthausen for the anniversary of the liberation that ultimately saved them. United by their remarkable experiences of survival against all odds, they now consider each other &#8220;siblings of the heart.&#8221; In Born Survivors, Wendy Holden brings all three stories together for the first time to mark their seventieth birthdays and the seventieth anniversary of the ending of the war.</p>
<p>                    A heart-stopping account of how three mothers and their newborns fought to survive the Holocaust, Born Survivors is also a life-affirming celebration of our capacity to care and to love amid inconceivable cruelty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER</p>
<p>                    Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.</p>
<p>                    In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.</p>
<p>                    Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online &#8211; a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet&#8217;s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A clear-eyed account of learning how to lead in a chaotic world, by General Jim Mattis&#8211;the former Secretary of Defense and one of the most formidable strategic thinkers of our time&#8211;and Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense and combat Marine. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A four-star general&#8217;s five-star memoir.&#8221;&#8211;The Wall Street Journal </p>
<p>                     Call Sign Chaos is the account of Jim Mattis&#8217;s storied career, from wide-ranging leadership roles in three wars to ultimately commanding a quarter of a million troops across the Middle East. Along the way, Mattis recounts his foundational experiences as a leader, extracting the lessons he has learned about the nature of warfighting and peacemaking, the importance of allies, and the strategic dilemmas&#8211;and short-sighted thinking&#8211;now facing our nation. He makes it clear why America must return to a strategic footing so as not to continue winning battles but fighting inconclusive wars. </p>
<p>                     Mattis divides his book into three parts: Direct Leadership, Executive Leadership, and Strategic Leadership. In the first part, Mattis recalls his early experiences leading Marines into battle, when he knew his troops as well as his own brothers. In the second part, he explores what it means to command thousands of troops and how to adapt your leadership style to ensure your intent is understood by your most junior troops so that they can own their mission. In the third part, Mattis describes the challenges and techniques of leadership at the strategic level, where military leaders reconcile war&#8217;s grim realities with political leaders&#8217; human aspirations, where complexity reigns and the consequences of imprudence are severe, even catastrophic. </p>
<p>                     Call Sign Chaos is a memoir of a life of warfighting and lifelong learning, following along as Mattis rises from Marine recruit to four-star general. It is a journey about learning to lead and a story about how he, through constant study and action, developed a unique leadership philosophy, one relevant to us all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER </p>
<p>                    In his bare-knuckles account, Stevens confesses to the reader that the entire apparatus of his Republican Party is built on a pack of lies&#8230; This reckoning inspired Stevens to publish this blistering, tell-all history&#8230; Although this book will be a hard read for any committed conservatives, they would do well to ponder it.<br />
                    &#8211;Julian E. Zelizer, The New York Times </p>
<p>                    From the most successful Republican political operative of his generation, a searing, unflinching, and deeply personal exposé of how his party became what it is today </p>
<p>                    Stuart Stevens spent decades electing Republicans at every level, from presidents to senators to local officials. He knows the GOP as intimately as anyone in America, and in this new book he offers a devastating portrait of a party that has lost its moral and political compass. </p>
<p>                    This is not a book about how Donald J. Trump hijacked the Republican Party and changed it into something else. Stevens shows how Trump is in fact the natural outcome of five decades of hypocrisy and self-delusion, dating all the way back to the civil rights legislation of the early 1960s. Stevens shows how racism has always lurked in the modern GOP&#8217;s DNA, from Goldwater&#8217;s opposition to desegregation to Ronald Reagan&#8217;s welfare queens and states&#8217; rights rhetoric. He gives an insider&#8217;s account of the rank hypocrisy of the party&#8217;s claims to embody family values, and shows how the party&#8217;s vaunted commitment to fiscal responsibility has been a charade since the 1980s. When a party stands for nothing, he argues, it is only natural that it will be taken over by the loudest and angriest voices in the room. </p>
<p>                    It Was All a Lie is not just an indictment of the Republican Party, but a candid and often lacerating mea culpa. Stevens is not asking for pity or forgiveness; he is simply telling us what he has seen firsthand. He helped to create the modern party that kneels before a morally bankrupt con man and now he wants nothing more than to see what it has become burned to the ground.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Susan E. Rice, National Security Advisor to President Barack Obama and US Ambassador to the United Nations, reveals her powerful story with unflinching candor in this New York Times bestseller.</p>
<p>                     Mother, wife, scholar, diplomat, and fierce champion of American interests and values, Susan Rice powerfully connects the personal and the professional. Taught early, with tough love, how to compete and excel as an African American woman in settings where people of color are few, Susan now shares the wisdom she learned along the way in this &#8220;personal and honest&#8230;ode to public service&#8221; (NPR).</p>
<p>                     Laying bare the family struggles that shaped her early life she also examines the ancestral legacies that influenced her. Rice&#8217;s elders-immigrants on one side and descendants of slaves on the other-encouraged each generation to rise. And rise they did, in uniform and in the pulpit, as educators, community leaders, and public servants.</p>
<p>                     Susan too rose rapidly. She served throughout the Clinton administration, becoming one of the nation&#8217;s youngest assistant secretaries of state and, later, one of President Obama&#8217;s most trusted advisors.</p>
<p>                     Rice provides an insider&#8217;s account of some of the most complex issues confronting the United States over three decades, from &#8220;Black Hawk Down&#8221; in Somalia to the genocide in Rwanda, and from conflicts in Libya and Syria to the Ebola epidemic, a secret channel to Iran, and the opening to Cuba during the Obama years.</p>
<p>                     With unmatched insight and characteristic bluntness, she reveals previously untold stories behind recent national security challenges, including confrontations with Russia and China, the war against ISIS, the fallout from Edward Snowden&#8217;s NSA leaks, the US response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, and the surreal transition to the Trump administration.</p>
<p>                     Although you might think you know Susan Rice-whose name became synonymous with Benghazi following her Sunday news show appearances after the deadly 2012 terrorist attacks in Libya-now, through these pages, you truly will know her for the first time. &#8220;An astute, analytical take on recent American political history,&#8221; (Publishers Weekly, starred review) Tough Love makes an urgent appeal to the American public to bridge our dangerous domestic divides in order to preserve our democracy and sustain our global leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Penguin Classic     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Age can never dull this kind of writing,&#8221; writes the Chicago Tribune of John Steinbeck&#8217;s dispatches from World War II, filed for the New York Herald Tribune in 1943, which vividly captured the human side of war. Writing from England in the midst of the London blitz, North Africa, and Italy, Steinbeck focuses on the people as opposed to the battles, portraying everyone from the guys in the bomber crew to Bob Hope on his USO tour. He eats and drinks with soldiers behind enemy lines, talks with them, and fights beside them. First published in book form in 1958, these writings, now with a new introduction by Mark Bowden, create an unforgettable portrait of life in wartime that continues to resonate with truth and humanity.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In his signature larger-than-life style, Arnold Schwarzenegger&#8217;s Total Recall is a revealing self-portrait of his illustrious, controversial, and truly unique life. </p>
<p>                    The greatest immigrant success story of our time. </p>
<p>                     His story is unique, and uniquely entertaining, and he tells it brilliantly in these pages. </p>
<p>                     He was born in a year of famine, in a small Austrian town, the son of an austere police chief. He dreamed of moving to America to become a bodybuilding champion and a movie star. </p>
<p>                     By the age of twenty-one, he was living in Los Angeles and had been crowned Mr. Universe. </p>
<p>                     Within five years, he had learned English and become the greatest bodybuilder in the world. </p>
<p>                     Within ten years, he had earned his college degree and was a millionaire from his business enterprises in real estate, landscaping, and bodybuilding. He was also the winner of a Golden Globe Award for his debut as a dramatic actor in Stay Hungry. </p>
<p>                     Within twenty years, he was the world&#8217;s biggest movie star, the husband of Maria Shriver, and an emerging Republican leader who was part of the Kennedy family. </p>
<p>                     Thirty-six years after coming to America, the man once known by fellow body-builders as the Austrian Oak was elected governor of California, the seventh largest economy in the world. </p>
<p>                     He led the state through a budget crisis, natural disasters, and political turmoil, working across party lines for a better environment, election reforms, and bipartisan solutions. </p>
<p>                     With Maria Shriver, he raised four fantastic children. In the wake of a scandal he brought upon himself, he tried to keep his family together. </p>
<p>                     Until now, he has never told the full story of his life, in his own voice. </p>
<p>                     Here is Arnold, with total recall.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[The Gulag Archipelago] helped to bring down an empire. Its importance can hardly be exaggerated&#8217; Doris Lessing, Sunday Telegraph</p>
<p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WITH A NEW FOREWORD BY JORDAN B. PETERSON</p>
<p>                    A vast canvas of camps, prisons, transit centres and secret police, of informers and spies and interrogators but also of everyday heroism, The Gulag Archipelago is Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s grand masterwork. Based on the testimony of some 200 survivors, and on the recollection of Solzhenitsyn&#8217;s own eleven years in labour camps and exile, it chronicles the story of those at the heart of the Soviet Union who opposed Stalin, and for whom the key to survival lay not in hope but in despair.</p>
<p>                    A thoroughly researched document and a feat of literary and imaginative power, this edition of The Gulag Archipelago was abridged into one volume at the author&#8217;s wish and with his full co-operation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY JANET MASLIN, THE NEW YORK TIMES</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Victoria the Queen, Julia Baird&#8217;s exquisitely wrought and meticulously researched biography, brushes the dusty myth off this extraordinary monarch&#8217; The New York Times Book Review (Editor&#8217;s Choice).</p>
<p>                    The true story for fans of the hit ITV drama series Victoria starring Jenna Coleman, this page-turning biography reveals the real woman behind the myth: a bold, glamorous, unbreakable queen. Drawing on previously unpublished papers, this stunning book is a story of love and heartbreak, of devotion and grief, of strength and resilience.</p>
<p>                    When Victoria was born, in 1819, the world was a very different place. Revolution would begin to threaten many of Europe&#8217;s monarchies in the coming decades. In Britain, a generation of royals had indulged their whims at the public&#8217;s expense, and republican sentiment was growing. The Industrial Revolution was transforming the landscape, and the British Empire was commanding ever larger parts of the globe. Born into a world where woman were often powerless, during a century roiling with change, Victoria went on to rule the most powerful country on earth with a decisive hand.</p>
<p>                    Fifth in line to the throne at the time of her birth, Victoria was an ordinary woman thrust into an extraordinary role. As a girl, she defied her mother&#8217;s meddling and an adviser&#8217;s bullying, forging an iron will of her own. As a teenage queen, she eagerly grasped the crown and relished the freedom it brought her. At twenty years old, she fell passionately in love with Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, eventually giving birth to nine children. She loved sex and delighted in power. She was outspoken with her ministers, overstepping boundaries and asserting her opinions. After the death of her adored Albert, she began a controversial, intimate relationship with her servant John Brown. She survived eight assassination attempts over the course of her lifetime. And as science, technology, and democracy were dramatically reshaping the world, Victoria was a symbol of steadfastness and security-queen of a quarter of the world&#8217;s population at the height of the British Empire&#8217;s reach.</p>
<p>                    Drawing on sources that include revelations about Victoria&#8217;s relationship with John Brown, Julia Baird brings vividly to life the fascinating story of a woman who struggled with so many of the things we do today: balancing work and family, raising children, navigating marital strife, losing parents, combating anxiety and self-doubt, finding an identity, searching for meaning. This sweeping, page-turning biography gives us the real woman behind the myth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As President Trump&#8217;s National Security Advisor, John Bolton spent many of his 453 days in the room where it happened, and the facts speak for themselves. </p>
<p>                    The result is a White House memoir that is the most comprehensive and substantial account of the Trump Administration, and one of the few to date by a top-level official. With almost daily access to the President, John Bolton has produced a precise rendering of his days in and around the Oval Office. What Bolton saw astonished him: a President for whom getting reelected was the only thing that mattered, even if it meant endangering or weakening the nation. &#8220;I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn&#8217;t driven by reelection calculations,&#8221; he writes. In fact, he argues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump&#8217;s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy-and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the Administration to raise alarms about them.</p>
<p>                    He shows a President addicted to chaos, who embraced our enemies and spurned our friends, and was deeply suspicious of his own government. In Bolton&#8217;s telling, all this helped put Trump on the bizarre road to impeachment. &#8220;The differences between this presidency and previous ones I had served were stunning,&#8221; writes Bolton, who worked for Reagan, Bush 41, and Bush 43. He discovered a President who thought foreign policy is like closing a real estate deal-about personal relationships, made-for-TV showmanship, and advancing his own interests. As a result, the US lost an opportunity to confront its deepening threats, and in cases like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea ended up in a more vulnerable place. </p>
<p>                    Bolton&#8217;s account starts with his long march to the West Wing as Trump and others woo him for the National Security job. The minute he lands, he has to deal with Syria&#8217;s chemical attack on the city of Douma, and the crises after that never stop. As he writes in the opening pages, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t like turmoil, uncertainty, and risk-all the while being constantly overwhelmed with information, decisions to be made, and sheer amount of work-and enlivened by international and domestic personality and ego conflicts beyond description, try something else.&#8221; </p>
<p>                    The turmoil, conflicts, and egos are all there-from the upheaval in Venezuela, to the erratic and manipulative moves of North Korea&#8217;s Kim Jong Un, to the showdowns at the G7 summits, the calculated warmongering by Iran, the crazy plan to bring the Taliban to Camp David, and the placating of an authoritarian China that ultimately exposed the world to its lethal lies. But this seasoned public servant also has a great eye for the Washington inside game, and his story is full of wit and wry humor about how he saw it played.</p>
