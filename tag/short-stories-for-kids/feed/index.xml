                    A can&#8217;t-live-without guide for guests of the Hotel Valhalla, this volume contains facts about the Norse gods as well as other characters and creatures you might encounter if you are fortunate enough to be chosen as one of Odin&#8217;s brave warriors.<br />
                    So you&#8217;ve made it to Valhalla. Now what?This &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; guide to the gods, goddesses, and other important figures of Norse mythology was commissioned by Helgi, who, after more than a millennium as manager of Hotel Valhalla, became fed up with answering the same questions from newly deceased heroes at check-in.<br />
                    The profiles provide essential stats, interviews, and personal reflections so you can identify the gods and avoid those awkward introductions. Handy facts about other beings round out this go-to tome. You&#8217;ll never see Ratatosk as a cute little rodent or confuse a dwarf with an elf ever again!    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Beloved characters from the Magnus Chase series star in these short stories, each set in a different one of the Nine Worlds from Norse mythology.<br />
                    The Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard trilogy may have concluded, but we haven&#8217;t heard the last of our favorite peeps from the Nine Worlds.<br />
                    Join Hearthstone, Blitzen, Samirah, Alex, Jack, T.J., Mallory, Halfborn, and more on a hilarious and unforgettable journey through Rick Riordan&#8217;s unique take on Norse mythology.<br />
                    While Magnus is off visiting his cousin, Annabeth, his friends find themselves in some sticky, hairy, and smelly situations as they try to outwit moronic giants, murderous creatures, and meddlesome gods.<br />
                    Can they stave off Ragnarok at least until Magnus gets back?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to an awful camp orientation video created by the god Apollo, Percy Jackson and other residents of Camp Half-Blood answer such questions as What is this place? and Do I get to keep the T-shirt? Newbies can check out the section on the Divine Cabins, read up on Magical Landmarks, and consult the chapter of Training Arenas.<br />
                    But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there. For instance, campers do not always co-exist in peace and harmony. The camp is not run with superior efficiency. Prophecies do not flow forth with great regularity.<br />
                    Sprinkled throughout are stories from heroes who have called Camp Half-Blood home or just passed through on their way to places unknown. Chiron himself introduces the book with a brief history of training based on his millennia of experience. And, of course, there are divine words of wisdom from the god Apollo himself, because . . . well, because the demigod authors would prefer not to be struck down, thank you very much.    </p>
