										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Homer called it a divine substance. Plato described it as especially dear to the gods. As Mark Kurlansky so brilliantly relates here, salt has shaped civilisation from the beginning, and its story is a glittering, often surprising part of the history of mankind. Wars have been fought over salt and, while salt taxes secured empires across Europe and Asia, they have also inspired revolution &#8211; Gandhi&#8217;s salt march in 1930 began the overthrow of British rule in India.     </p>
<p>                    From the rural Sichuan province where the last home-made soya sauce is produced to the Cheshire brine springs that supplied salt around the globe, Mark Kurlansky has produced a kaleidoscope of world history, a multi-layered masterpiece that blends political, commercial, scientific, religious and culinary records into a rich and memorable tale.</p>

<p>                    Brian Murray was not an investment pro when he bought his first commercial property. He was a teacher looking to build some side income. Armed with his passion for business and a lot of common sense, he developed a simple yet highly effective approach to investing that he still uses today at his multimillion-dollar real estate company.     </p>
<p>                    Crushing It in Apartments and Commercial Real Estate is a beginner&#8217;s guide to investing based on Murray&#8217;s experience bootstrapping his way from newbie investor to award-winning CEO of Washington Street Properties. Murray shares the secrets to his success through straightforward, actionable advice that will help you get started no matter what your experience level, or how much cash you have on hand. You&#8217;ll learn how to:     </p>
<p>                      Find and creatively finance commercial property Grow a portfolio without any help from outside investors and without taking on excessive debt Use your small-investor status as a competitive advantage over corporate investors Identify simple, practical ways to increase profits while keeping costs low      </p>
<p>                    Murray also shares real-life stories that reveal exactly how he grew his business, and the hard lessons he learned along the way (so you don&#8217;t have to). Whether you already invest in real estate and want to go bigger, or you&#8217;ve never owned a property, this book gives you the tools and wisdom you need to crush it in apartments and commercial real estate.    </p>
<p>                    Brian Murray is the founder and CEO of Washington Street Properties, a commercial real estate investment company that has been ranked on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States for three years in a row.
