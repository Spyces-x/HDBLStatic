										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For fans of David Sedaris, Tina Fey and Caitlin Moran comes Furiously Happy from Jenny Lawson, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened.    </p>
<p>                    In Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Jenny Lawson regaled readers with uproarious stories of her bizarre childhood. In Furiously Happy she explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. And terrible ideas are what Jenny does best.    </p>
<p>                    As Jenny says: &#8216;You can&#8217;t experience pain without also experiencing the baffling and ridiculous moments of being fiercely, unapologetically, intensely and (above all) furiously happy.&#8217;  It&#8217;s a philosophy that has &#8211; quite literally &#8211; saved her life.    </p>
<p>                    Jenny&#8217;s first book, Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, was ostensibly about family, but deep down it was about celebrating your own weirdness. Furiously Happy is a book about mental illness, but under the surface it&#8217;s about embracing joy in fantastic and outrageous ways.  And who doesn&#8217;t need a bit more of that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During his 84-year life Benjamin Franklin was America&#8217;s best scientist, inventor, publisher, business strategist, diplomat, and writer. He was also one of its most practical political thinkers. America&#8217;s first great publicist, he carefully crafted his own persona, portrayed it in public and polished it for posterity. In this riveting new biography Walter Isaacson provides readers with a full portrait of Franklin&#8217;s public and private life &#8211; his loyal but neglected wife, his bastard son with whom he broke over going to war with England, his endless replacement families and his many amorous, but probably unconsummated, liaisons. But this is not just a biography of Benjamin Franklin but rather a fascinating look at American and European political history at that time. Isaacson examines the run up to the Revolutionary War, the intimate relations between Britain, France and the colonies and the decisive events that led to America&#8217;s independence. Just as David McCullough brought life to the historic figure of John Adams, Isaacson portrays Franklin in the flesh, showing readers how this radical man helped define America&#8217;s national character and personality.</p>

<p>                                NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE<br />
                    Oscar Nominated For Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay    </p>
<p>                                Set amid the civil rights movement, the never-before-told true story of NASA&#8217;s African-American female mathematicians who played a crucial role in America&#8217;s space program.    </p>
<p>                              Before Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, a group of professionals worked as &#8216;Human Computers&#8217;, calculating the flight paths that would enable these historic achievements. Among these were a coterie of bright, talented African-American women. Segregated from their white counterparts, these &#8216;colored computers&#8217; used pencil and paper to write the equations that would launch rockets, and astronauts, into space.    </p>
<p>                              Moving from World War II through NASA&#8217;s golden age, touching on the civil rights era, the Space Race, the Cold War, and the women&#8217;s rights movement, Hidden Figures interweaves a rich history of mankind&#8217;s greatest adventure with the intimate stories of five courageous women whose work forever changed the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firebrand conservative columnist, commentator, Internet entrepreneur, and #1 New York Times bestselling author Michelle Malkin tells the fascinating, little-known stories of the inventors who have contributed to American exceptionalism and technological progress.     </p>
<p>                    Call them America&#8217;s &#8220;tinkerpreneurs&#8221;&#8211;unsung innovators who commercialized their &#8220;little&#8221; ideas to create products, companies, wealth, and opportunities that thrive today. Tireless, self-made, and largely self-taught, they raised our standard of living with the creation of items we daily take for granted, from razors to bottle caps, flashlights to bridge cables.     </p>
<p>                    This entertaining and enlightening treasury is, in part, Michelle Malkin&#8217;s response to President Obama&#8217;s infamous assertion that &#8220;if you&#8217;ve got a business, you didn&#8217;t build that.&#8221; She examines how factors such as profit motive, intellectual property rights, patriotism, faith, family, and an unwavering belief in American exceptionalism set the stage for the creation of toilet paper, glass bottles, the hydroelectric power plant, and more.     </p>
<p>                    Demonized by the left as greedy villains and selfish barons, these visionaries have nurtured job-creating powerhouses used today by &#8220;progressive&#8221; propagandists who can&#8217;t comprehend how much comfort and convenience they enjoy as a result of the ingenious contributions by these original American dreamers. Are they rich? You bet. They earned their private rewards for the public good. Find out Who Built That&#8211;and the next time you turn on your air conditioner, say thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Moneyball meets medicine in this remarkable chronicle of one of the greatest scientific quests of our time&#8211;the groundbreaking program to answer the most essential question for humanity: how do we live and die?&#8211;and the visionary mastermind behind it.    </p>
<p>                    Medical doctor and economist Christopher Murray began the Global Burden of Disease studies to gain a truer understanding of how we live and how we die. While it is one of the largest scientific projects ever attempted&#8211;as breathtaking as the first moon landing or the Human Genome Project&#8211;the questions it answers are meaningful for every one of us: What are the world&#8217;s health problems? Who do they hurt? How much? Where? Why?    </p>
<p>                    Murray argues that the ideal existence isn&#8217;t simply the longest but the one lived well and with the least illness. Until we can accurately measure how people live and die, we cannot understand what makes us sick or do much to improve it. Challenging the accepted wisdom of the WHO and the UN, the charismatic and controversial health maverick has made enemies&#8211;and some influential friends, including Bill Gates who gave Murray a $100 million grant.    </p>
<p>                    In Epic Measures, journalist Jeremy N. Smith offers an intimate look at Murray and his groundbreaking work. From ranking countries&#8217; healthcare systems (the U.S. is 37th) to unearthing the shocking reality that world governments are funding developing countries at only 30% of the potential maximum efficiency when it comes to health, Epic Measures introduces a visionary leader whose unwavering determination to improve global health standards has already changed the way the world addresses issues of health and wellness, sets policy, and distributes funding.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1940s and 50s, when the newly minted Jet Propulsion Laboratory needed quick-thinking mathematicians to calculate velocities and plot trajectories, they recruited an elite group of young women who, with only pencil, paper, and mathematical prowess, transformed rocket design, helped bring about the first American satellites, and made the exploration of the solar system possible. Rise of the Rocket Girls tells the stories of these women&#8211;known as &#8220;human computers&#8221;&#8211;who broke the boundaries of both gender and science. Based on extensive research and interviews, Nathalia Holt offers a unique perspective on the role of women in science: both where we&#8217;ve been, and the far reaches of space to which we&#8217;re heading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back on the earth after three spaceflights, Chris Hadfield&#8217;s captivating memoir An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth reveals extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality.    </p>
<p>                    Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4,000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft, and become a YouTube sensation with his performance of David Bowie&#8217;s &#8216;Space Oddity&#8217; in space. The secret to Chris Hadfield&#8217;s success &#8211; and survival &#8211; is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst &#8211; and enjoy every moment of it.    </p>
<p>                    In his book, An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth, Chris Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement &#8211; and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counter-intuitive lessons: don&#8217;t visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff.    </p>
<p>                    You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Colonel Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights in this book will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth &#8211; especially your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In `Tesla: Man Out of Time, ` Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century&#8217;s greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field &#8212; the basis of most alternating-current machinery &#8212; but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties.  From Tesla&#8217;s childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered &#8212; and continue to alter &#8212; the world in which we live. `Tesla: Man Out of Time` is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the dramatic story of how a noted tech venture capitalist, an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and investor in his company, woke up to the serious damage Facebook was doing to our society and set out to try to stop it.    </p>
<p>                              If you had told Roger McNamee three years ago that he would soon be devoting himself to stopping Facebook from destroying democracy, he would have howled with laughter. He had mentored many tech leaders in his illustrious career as an investor, but few things had made him prouder, or been better for his fund&#8217;s bottom line, than his early service to Mark Zuckerberg. Still a large shareholder in Facebook, he had every good reason to stay on the bright side. Until he simply couldn&#8217;t.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is McNamee&#8217;s intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head of one of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing. It&#8217;s a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author&#8217;s dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors. Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face.     </p>
<p>                              And then comes Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has been put. To McNamee&#8217;s shock, Facebook&#8217;s leaders still duck and dissemble, viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travellers who share his concerns, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention economy more broadly &#8211; to our public health and to our political order.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is both an enthralling personal narrative and a masterful explication of the forces that have conspired to place us all on the horns of this dilemma. This is the story of a company and its leadership, but it&#8217;s also a larger tale of a business sector unmoored from normal constraints, at a moment of political and cultural crisis, the worst possible time to be given new tools for summoning the darker angels of our nature and whipping them into a frenzy. This is a wise, hard-hitting, and urgently necessary account that crystallizes the issue definitively for the rest of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Lyons was Technology Editor at Newsweek Magazine for years, a magazine writer at the top of his profession. One Friday morning he received a phone call: his job no longer existed. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was unemployed and facing financial oblivion. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the nebulous role of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What could possibly go wrong?     </p>
<p>                     What follows is a hilarious and excoriating account of Dan&#8217;s time at the start-up and a revealing window onto the dysfunctional culture that prevails in a world flush with cash and devoid of experience. Filled with stories of meaningless jargon, teddy bears at meetings, push-up competitions and all-night parties, this uproarious tale is also a trenchant analysis of the dysfunctional start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them. It is a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to cash out with a fortune.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE FT AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD 2019    </p>
<p>                    NEW YORK TIMES AND SUNDAY TIMES BUSINESS BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                                    &#8216;Reads more like a delicious page-turning novel&#8230;Put it on your holiday gift list for your favourite hedge-fund honcho&#8217; Bloomberg    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling read&#8217; Economist    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Captivating&#8217; New York Times book review    </p>
<p>                    Jim Simons is the greatest moneymaker in modern financial history. His record bests those of legendary investors, including Warren Buffett, George Soros and Ray Dalio. Yet Simons and his strategies are shrouded in mystery. The financial industry has long craved a look inside Simons&#8217;s secretive hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies and veteran Wall Street Journal reporter Gregory Zuckerman delivers the goods.    </p>
<p>                    After a legendary career as a mathematician and a stint breaking Soviet codes, Simons set out to conquer financial markets with a radical approach. Simons hired physicists, mathematicians and computer scientists &#8211; most of whom knew little about finance &#8211; to amass piles of data and build algorithms hunting for the deeply hidden patterns in global markets. Experts scoffed, but Simons and his colleagues became some of the richest in the world, their strategy of creating mathematical models and crunching data embraced by almost every industry today.    </p>
<p>                    As Renaissance became a major player in the financial world, its executives began exerting influence on other areas. Simons became a major force in scientific research, education and Democratic politics, funding Hilary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign. While senior executive Robert Mercer is more responsible than anyone else for the Trump presidency &#8211; he placed Steve Bannon in the campaign, funded Trump&#8217;s victorious 2016 effort and backed alt-right publication Breitbart. Mercer also impacted the success of the Brexit campaign as he made significant investments in Cambridge Anatlytica. For all his prescience, Simons failed to anticipate how Mercer&#8217;s activity would impact his firm and the world.    </p>
<p>                    In this fast-paced narrative, Zuckerman examines how Simons launched a quantitative revolution on Wall Street, and reveals the impact that Simons, the quiet billionaire king of the quants, has had on worlds well beyond finance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    An adrenaline-fuelled expose of life inside the tech bubble, Chaos Monkeys lays bare the secrets, power plays and lifestyle excesses of the visionaries, grunts, sociopaths, opportunists and money cowboys who are revolutionising our world. Written by startup CEO and industry provocateur Antonio Garcia Martinez, this is Liar&#8217;s Poker meets The Social Network.     </p>
<p>                    Computer engineers use &#8216;chaos monkey&#8217; software to wreak havoc and test system robustness. Similarly, tech entrepreneurs like Antonio Garcia Martinez are society&#8217;s chaos monkeys &#8211; their innovations disrupt every aspect of our lives, from transportation (Uber) and holidays (Airbnb) to television (Netflix) and dating (Tinder) &#8211; all in search of the perfect business miracle.      </p>
<p>                    Describing himself as &#8216;high-strung, fast-talking, and wired on a combination of caffeine, fear, and greed at all times&#8217;, Garcia Martinez left Wall Street to make his fortune in Silicon Valley, becoming CEO of his own startup, before bailing and being poached by Facebook&#8217;s nascent advertising team. Here he turned users&#8217; data into profit for COO Sheryl Sandberg and chairman and CEO Mark &#8216;Zuck&#8217; Zuckerberg. Forced out of Facebook in the wake of a bitter internal product war, Garcia Martinez  took his unique brand of entrepreneurial hyperactivity to rivals Twitter. Along the way, he got into a lot of trouble with a lot of people, brewed illegal beer on the Facebook campus (accidentally flooding Zuckerberg&#8217;s desk), lived on a yacht, raced sport cars on the highway, and enthusiastically pursued the lifestyle of an overpaid Silicon Valley mercenary.    </p>
<p>                    In Chaos Monkeys he tells you HOW &#8211; and HOW NOT &#8211; to make a fortune through startups and digital marketing.  Highly entertaining and always offering genuine insight, Garcia Martinez  unravels the chaotic evolution of social media and online marketing. From startups and credit derivatives to Big Brother and data tracking, social media monetisation and digital &#8216;privacy&#8217;, he shares both his scathing observations and outrageous antics, taking us on a subversive and very funny tour of the fascinatingly insular and unbelievably wealthy tech industry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; Read with Jenna Book Club Pick as Featured on Today &#8211; As a young mother facing a terminal diagnosis, Julie Yip-Williams began to write her story, a story like no other. What began as the chronicle of an imminent and early death became something much more&#8211;a powerful exhortation to the living.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An exquisitely moving portrait of the daily stuff of life.&#8221;&#8211;The New York Times Book Review (Editors&#8217; Choice) NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The New York Times Book Review &#8211; Time &#8211; Real Simple &#8211; Good Housekeeping  That Julie Yip-Williams survived infancy was a miracle. Born blind in Vietnam, she narrowly escaped euthanasia at the hands of her grandmother, only to flee with her family the political upheaval of her country in the late 1970s. Loaded into a rickety boat with three hundred other refugees, Julie made it to Hong Kong and, ultimately, America, where a surgeon at UCLA gave her partial sight. She would go on to become a Harvard-educated lawyer, with a husband, a family, and a life she had once assumed would be impossible. Then, at age thirty-seven, with two little girls at home, Julie was diagnosed with terminal metastatic colon cancer, and a different journey began.  The Unwinding of the Miracle is the story of a vigorous life refracted through the prism of imminent death. When she was first diagnosed, Julie Yip-Williams sought clarity and guidance through the experience and, finding none, began to write her way through it&#8211;a chronicle that grew beyond her imagining. Motherhood, marriage, the immigrant experience, ambition, love, wanderlust, tennis, fortune-tellers, grief, reincarnation, jealousy, comfort, pain, the marvel of the body in full rebellion&#8211;this book is as sprawling and majestic as the life it records. It is inspiring and instructive, delightful and shattering. It is a book of indelible moments, seared deep&#8211;an incomparable guide to living vividly by facing hard truths consciously.  With humor, bracing honesty, and the cleansing power of well-deployed anger, Julie Yip-Williams set the stage for her lasting legacy and one final miracle: the story of her life. Praise for The Unwinding of the Miracle  &#8220;Everything worth understanding and holding on to is in this book. . . . A miracle indeed.&#8221;&#8211;Kelly Corrigan, New York Times bestselling author &#8220;A beautifully written, moving, and compassionate chronicle that deserves to be read and absorbed widely.&#8221;&#8211;Siddhartha Mukherjee, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Emperor of All Maladies</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To his colleagues, Richard Feynman was not so much a genius as he was a full-blown magician: someone who &#8220;does things that nobody else could do and that seem completely unexpected.&#8221; The path he cleared for twentieth-century physics led from the making of the atomic bomb to a Nobel Prize-winning theory of quantam electrodynamics to his devastating exposé of the Challenger space shuttle disaster. At the same time, the ebullient Feynman established a reputation as an eccentric showman, a master safe cracker and bongo player, and a wizard of seduction.     </p>
<p>                    Now James Gleick, author of the bestselling Chaos, unravels teh dense skein of Feynman&#8217;s thought as well as the paradoxes of his character in a biography&#8211;which was nominated for a National Book Award&#8211;of outstanding lucidity and compassion.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Norman Borlaug was the only person during the twentieth century who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for work in agriculture and food. There is no Nobel Food Prize, so the Nobel Committee chose Dr. Borlaug as the 1970 recipient of the Peace Prize based on his dramatic scientific breakthroughs and wheat production technology that relieved hunger in much of the world. During the previous decade, many people on the planet Earth, most notably in China and the Asian Subcontinent, were facing starvation, even famine. Borlaug&#8217;s revolutionary achievements relieved widespread human suffering and brought peace.    </p>
<p>                    Dr. Borlaug was hailed as the person who saved the lives of more people&#8211;hundreds of millions&#8211;from starvation than any person in history. He earned the distinction as one of the 100 most influential individuals of the 20th century. His is an inspiring story; he went from an unpretentious Iowa farm boy to scientist-cum-humanist of world acclaim.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our world today,from the phone in your pocket to the car that you drive, the allure of social media to the strategy of the Pentagon,has been shaped irrevocably by the technology of silicon transistors. Year after year, for half a century, these tiny switches have enabled ever-more startling capabilities. Their incredible proliferation has altered the course of human history as dramatically as any political or social revolution. At the heart of it all has been one quiet Californian: Gordon Moore.At Fairchild Semiconductor, his seminal Silicon Valley startup, Moore,a young chemist turned electronics entrepreneur,had the defining insight: silicon transistors, and microchips made of them, could make electronics profoundly cheap and immensely powerful. Microchips could double in power, then redouble again in clockwork fashion. History has borne out this insight, which we now call  Moore&#8217;s Law&#8221;, and Moore himself, having recognized it, worked endlessly to realize his vision. With Moore&#8217;s technological leadership at Fairchild and then at his second start-up, the Intel Corporation, the law has held for fifty years. The result is profound: from the days of enormous, clunky computers of limited capability to our new era, in which computers are placed everywhere from inside of our bodies to the surface of Mars.Moore led nothing short of a revolution. In  Moore&#8217;s Law , Arnold Thackray, David C. Brock, and Rachel Jones give the authoritative account of Gordon Moore&#8217;s life and his role in the development both of Silicon Valley and the transformative technologies developed there. Told by a team of writers with unparalleled access to Moore, his family, and his contemporaries, this is the human story of man and a career that have had almost superhuman effects. The history of twentieth-century technology is littered with overblown  revolutions.&#8221;  Moore&#8217;s Law  is essential reading for anyone seeking to learn what a real revolution looks like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The astonishing international bestseller that chronicles how a brain scientist&#8217;s own stroke led to enlightenment.    </p>
<p>                    On the morning of the 10th December 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven-year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist experienced a massive stroke when a blood vessel exploded in the left side of her brain.      </p>
<p>                    A neuroanatomist by profession, she observed her own mind completely deteriorate to the point that she lost the ability to walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life, all within the space of four hours. As the damaged left side of her brain &#8211; the rational, logical, detail and time-oriented side &#8211; swung in an out of function, Taylor alternated between two distinct and opposite realities: the euphoric Nirvana of the intuitive and emotional right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace; and the logical left brain, that realized Jill was having a stroke and enabled her to seek help before she was lost completely.     </p>
<p>                    In My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist&#8217;s Personal Journey, Taylor brings to light a new perspective on the brain and its capacity for recovery that she gained through the intimate experience of awakening her own injured mind. The journey to recovery took eight years for Jill to feel completely healed. Using her knowledge of how the brain works, her respect for the cells composing her human form, and an amazing mother, Taylor completely repaired her mind and recalibrated her understanding of the world according to the insight gained from her right brain that December morning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>BY THE WINNER OF THE 2020 NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY Finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A powerful mix of science and ethics . . . This book is required reading for every concerned citizen&#8211;the material it covers should be discussed in schools, colleges, and universities throughout the country.&#8221;&#8211; New York Review of Books      </p>
<p>                     Not since the atomic bomb has a technology so alarmed its inventors that they warned the world about its use. That is, until 2015, when biologist Jennifer Doudna called for a worldwide moratorium on the use of the gene-editing tool CRISPR&#8211;a revolutionary new technology that she helped create&#8211;to make heritable changes in human embryos. The cheapest, simplest, most effective way of manipulating DNA ever known, CRISPR may well give us the cure to HIV, genetic diseases, and some cancers. Yet even the tiniest changes to DNA could have myriad, unforeseeable consequences, to say nothing of the ethical and societal repercussions of intentionally mutating embryos to create &#8220;better&#8221; humans. Writing with fellow researcher Sam Sternberg, Doudna&#8211;who has since won the Nobel Prize for her CRISPR research&#8211;shares the thrilling story of her discovery and describes the enormous responsibility that comes with the power to rewrite the code of life.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The future is in our hands as never before, and this book explains the stakes like no other.&#8221; &#8212; George Lucas     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;An invaluable account . . . We owe Doudna several times over.&#8221; &#8212; Guardian</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Isaac Newton was born in a stone farmhouse in 1642, fatherless and unwanted by his mother. When he died in London in 1727 he was so renowned he was given a state funeral&#8211;an unheard-of honor for a subject whose achievements were in the realm of the intellect. During the years he was an irascible presence at Trinity College, Cambridge, Newton imagined properties of nature and gave them names&#8211;mass, gravity, velocity&#8211;things our science now takes for granted. Inspired by Aristotle, spurred on by Galileo&#8217;s discoveries and the philosophy of Descartes, Newton grasped the intangible and dared to take its measure, a leap of the mind unparalleled in his generation. James Gleick, the author of Chaos and Genius, and one of the most acclaimed science writers of his generation, brings the reader into Newton&#8217;s reclusive life and provides startlingly clear explanations of the concepts that changed forever our perception of bodies, rest, and motion&#8211;ideas so basic to the twenty-first century, it can truly be said: We are all Newtonians.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;For my money, a better book about Jobs than Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography&#8217; New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating reinterpretation of the Steve Jobs story&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    We all think we know who Steve Jobs was, what made him tick, and what made him succeed.     </p>
<p>                    Yet the single most important question about him has never been answered.     </p>
<p>                    The young, impulsive, egotistical genius was ousted in the mid-80s from the company he founded, exiled from his own kingdom and cast into the wilderness. Yet he returned a decade later to transform the ailing Apple into the most successful company the world had ever seen.     </p>
<p>                    How did this reckless upstart transform himself into a visionary business leader?     </p>
<p>                    The first comprehensive study of Jobs&#8217; career following his dismissal from Apple, written with unparalleled access and insight, BECOMING STEVE JOBS offers a startling new portrait of the most important business figure in modern history. The most intimate biography yet of Jobs, written by the journalist who knew him better than any other, BECOMING STEVE JOBS draws on recently discovered interviews that have never before seen the light of day, and answers for the first time the most pressing questions about what made this legendary business leader such a success.</p>

<p>                    The New York Times bestseller by poet Nina Riggs, mother of two young sons and the direct descendant of Ralph Waldo Emerson, is &#8220;a stunning&#8230;heart-rending meditation on life&#8230;It is this year&#8217;s When Breath Becomes Air&#8221; (The Washington Post).     </p>
<p>                    We are breathless but we love the days. They are promises. They are the only way to walk from one night to the other.     </p>
<p>                    Poet and essayist Nina Riggs was just thirty-seven years old when initially diagnosed with breast cancer&#8211;one small spot. Within a year, she received the devastating news that her cancer was terminal.     </p>

It&#8217;s about the way literature, especially Nina&#8217;s direct ancestor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and her other muse, Montaigne, can be a balm and a form of prayer.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book that sparked the modern environmental movement, with an unprecedented collection of letters, speeches, and other writings that reveal the extraordinary courage and vision of its author     </p>
<p>                    Library of America launches its Rachel Carson edition with this deluxe illustrated volume presenting one of the landmark books of the twentieth century together with rare letters, speeches, and other writings that reveal the personal courage and passionate commitment of its author. A huge bestseller when published in September 1962, Silent Spring led not only to many of the laws and government agencies that protect our air, land, and water, but prompted a revolution in environmental consciousness. Now for the first time, in previously unpublished and newly collected letters to biochemists, ecologists, cancer specialists, ornithologists, and other experts, Carson&#8217;s groundbreaking expose of the unintended consequences of pesticide use comes together piece-by-piece, like a puzzle or detective story. She makes common cause with conservationists and other allies to build public awareness, hiding her private battle with cancer for fear it might distract from her message. And in the wake of her book&#8217;s astonishing impact, as she becomes the target of an organized campaign of disinformation by the chemical industry, Carson speaks out in defense of her findings while remaining a model of grace under pressure. Throughout the collection, Carson&#8217;s lifelong love of nature shines through. In writings both lyrical and intensely moving, she conveys her sense of wonder to her young nephew, dreams of conserving old-growth forest in Maine for posterity, and recounts her adventures and epiphanies as birdwatcher and beachcomber. A future companion volume will gather Carson&#8217;s sea trilogy: Under the Sea-Wind (1941), The Sea Around Us (1951), and The Edge of the Sea (1955).     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY:<br />
                    Los Angeles Times &#8211; San Francisco Chronicle -Chicago Tribune &#8211; The Christian Science Monitor &#8211; Publishers Weekly     </p>
<p>                    In Strength in What Remains,  Tracy Kidder gives us the story of one man&#8217;s inspiring American journey and of the ordinary people who helped him, providing brilliant testament to the power of second chances. Deo arrives in the United States from Burundi in search of a new life. Having survived a civil war and genocide, he lands at JFK airport with two hundred dollars, no English, and no contacts. He ekes out a precarious existence delivering groceries, living in Central Park, and learning English by reading dictionaries in bookstores. Then Deo begins to meet the strangers who will change his life, pointing him eventually in the direction of Columbia University, medical school, and a life devoted to healing. Kidder breaks new ground in telling this unforgettable story as he travels with Deo back over a turbulent life and shows us what it means to be fully human.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of America&#8217;s great chefs&#8221; (Vogue), Grant Achatz, shares how his drive to cook immaculate food fueled his miraculous triumph over tongue cancer.     </p>
<p>                    By 2007 chef Grant Achatz had been named one of the best new chefs in America by Food &#038; Wine, he had received the James Beard Foundation Rising Star Chef of the Year Award, and he and Nick Kokonas had opened the conceptually radical restaurant Alinea, which was named Best Restaurant in America by Gourmet magazine. Then, positioned firmly in the world&#8217;s culinary spotlight, Achatz was diagnosed with stage IV squamous cell carcinoma-tongue cancer.    </p>
<p>                    The prognosis grim, Grant undertook an alternative treatment of aggressive chemotherapy and radiation that ravaged his body and left him without a sense of taste. Tapping into his profound discipline and passion, he trained his chefs to mimic his palate and learned how to cook with his other senses. As Kokonas was able to attest, the food was never better. Five months later, Grant was declared cancer-free and went on to achieve some of the highest honors in the culinary world. Life, on the Line is not only a chef&#8217;s memoir, it is also a book about survival, about nurturing creativity, and about profound friendship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Smart, delightful . . . a splendidly entertaining education in ethics, activism, and science.&#8221; -The New York Times Book Review (Editor&#8217;s Choice)    </p>
<p>                     An impassioned defense of intellectual freedom and a clarion call to intellectual responsibility, Galileo&#8217;s Middle Finger is one American&#8217;s eye-opening story of life in the trenches of scientific controversy. For two decades, historian Alice Dreger has led a life of extraordinary engagement, combining activist service to victims of unethical medical research with defense of scientists whose work has outraged identity politics activists. With spirit and wit, Dreger offers in Galileo&#8217;s Middle Finger an unforgettable vision of the importance of rigorous truth seeking in today&#8217;s America, where both the free press and free scholarly inquiry struggle under dire economic and political threats.    </p>
<p>                     This illuminating chronicle begins with Dreger&#8217;s own research into the treatment of people born intersex (once called hermaphrodites). Realization of the shocking surgical and ethical abuses conducted in the name of &#8220;normalizing&#8221; intersex children&#8217;s gender identities moved Dreger to become an internationally recognized patient rights activist. But even as the intersex rights movement succeeded, Dreger began to realize how some fellow progressive activists were employing lies and personal attacks to silence scientists whose data revealed uncomfortable truths about humans. In researching one such case, Dreger suddenly became the target of just these kinds of attacks.    </p>
<p>                     Troubled, she decided to try to understand more-to travel the country to ferret out the truth behind various controversies, to obtain a global view of the nature and costs of these battles. Galileo&#8217;s Middle Finger describes Dreger&#8217;s long and harrowing journeys between the two camps for which she felt equal empathy: social justice activists determined to win and researchers determined to put hard truths before comfort. Ultimately what emerges is a lesson about the intertwining of justice and of truth-and a lesson of the importance of responsible scholars and journalists to our fragile democracy.    </p>
<p>                     Praise for Galileo&#8217;s Middle Finger:<br />
                     &#8220;An engrossing volume that is sure to undo any lingering notions that academic debate is the province of empiricists who pledge allegiance to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth . . . Dreger&#8217;s clear and well-paced prose makes for compelling . . . reading.&#8221; -The Chicago Tribune</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The incredible true story of the origin of human flight, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough.    </p>
<p>                     On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.    </p>
<p>                     Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?    </p>
<p>                     David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly human story of Wilbur and Orville Wright. Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing.    </p>
<p>                     In this thrilling book, McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers&#8217; story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them.</p>
