										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hands-on user&#8217;s guide to the groundbreaking Wheel of Awareness meditation practice featured in the New York Times bestseller Aware takes readers step-by-step through a twenty-one-day journey to discover what it means to be truly present and aware in our daily lives.     </p>
<p>                    In today&#8217;s increasingly fast-paced world it can be difficult to find moments to catch your breath, regain inner balance, and just . . . be.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Unforgettable&#8217; The Times &#8216;Grippingly told and brilliantly reported&#8217; Mail on Sunday &#8216;Startlingly intimate&#8217; Sunday Times &#8216;Fascinating&#8217; Daily Mail &#8216;Groundbreaking&#8217; Evening Standard &#8216;Exceptional and moving&#8217; Spectator &#8216;Hidden Valley Road contains everything: scientific intrigue, meticulous reporting, startling revelations, and, most of all, a profound sense of humanity. It is that rare book that can be read again and again.&#8217; -David Grann, author of Killers of the Flower Moon One of the New York Times&#8217; &#8217;20 most anticipated books of 2020&#8242;: the heartrending story of a mid-century American family with twelve children, six of them diagnosed with schizophrenia, that became science&#8217;s great hope in the quest to understand the disease. &#8216;An extraordinary case study and tour de force of reporting.&#8217; -Sylvia Nasar, author of A Beautiful Mind Don and Mimi Galvin seemed to be living the American dream. After World War II, Don&#8217;s work with the Air Force brought them to Colorado, where their twelve children perfectly spanned the baby boom: the oldest born in 1945, the youngest in 1965. In those years, there was an established script for a family like the Galvins &#8211; aspiration, hard work, upward mobility, domestic harmony &#8211; and they worked hard to play their parts. But behind the scenes was a different story: psychological breakdown, sudden shocking violence, hidden abuse. By the mid-1970s, six of the ten Galvin boys, one after the other, were diagnosed as schizophrenic. How could all this happen to one family? What took place inside the house on Hidden Valley Road was so extraordinary that the Galvins became one of the first families to be studied by the National Institutes of Mental Health. Their story offers a shadow history of the science of schizophrenia, from the era of institutionalization, lobotomy, and the schizophrenogenic mother, to the search for genetic markers for the disease, always amidst profound disagreements about the nature of the illness itself. And unbeknownst to the Galvins, samples of their DNA informed decades of genetic research that continues today, offering paths to treatment, prediction, and even eradication of the disease for future generations. With clarity and compassion, bestselling and award-winning author Robert Kolker uncovers one family&#8217;s unforgettable legacy of suffering, love and hope. &#8216;This book tore my heart out. It is a revelation-about the history of mental health treatment, about trauma, foremost about family-and a more-than-worthy follow-up to Robert Kolker&#8217;s brilliant Lost Girls.&#8217; -Megan Abbott, Edgar Award-winning author of Dare Me and Give Me Your Hand</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From a pioneer in the field of mental health comes a groundbreaking book on the healing power of mindsight, the potent skill that allows you to make positive changes in your brain-and in your life.     </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Daniel Goleman, author of Emotional Intelligence     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can&#8217;t shake?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you ever wonder why you can&#8217;t stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?<br />
                    &#8211; Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?     </p>
<p>                    What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn&#8217;t mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.     </p>
<p>                    Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal<br />
                    &#8211; a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread<br />
                    &#8211; a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut, and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection<br />
                    &#8211; a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is like watching myself from outside myself and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting her     </p>
<p>                    These and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mobbing is a destructive social process in which individuals, groups, or organizations target a person for ridicule, humiliation, and removal from the workplace. It can lead to deteriorating physical and mental health, workplace violence, and even suicide. Studies indicate that as many as 37% of American workers have experienced workplace abuse at some time in their working lives.    </p>
<p>                    Overcoming Mobbing is an informative, comprehensive guidebook written for the victims of mobbing and their families who often can&#8217;t make sense of the experience or mobilize resources for recovery. In an engaging, reader-friendly style, the book distinguishes mobbing from bullying in that it takes place within organizational or institutional settings and involves organizational dynamics. Mobbing is not about the occasional negative experience at work; it is ongoing negative acts, both<br />
                    overt and covert, over time, that erode workers&#8217; confidence in themselves and in their workplaces and that no amount of sophistication or maturity can make sense of.  Duffy and Sperry, leading authorities on this special type of aggression, provide effective strategies for recovery from mobbing as well as for<br />
                    prevention, and they demystify the experience through the use of case vignettes. More than a simple self-help book, this volume brings the concept and terminology relating to mobbing into the public vocabulary by virtue of its strong foundation in psychological and organizational research. It offers a detailed presentation of the causes and consequences of mobbing, helps readers avoid falling into the trap of misplacing blame, and holds organizations at the center of responsibility for<br />
                    preventing the abuse. In addition to those who have experienced mobbing themselves, this book is an invaluable resource for workplace managers and human resources personnel who wish to prevent or reverse mobbing within their own professional settings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our ego, and its accompanying sense of self-doubt, is one affliction we all share. And while our ego claims to have our best interests at heart, in its never-ending pursuit of attention and power, it sabotages the very goals it sets to achieve. In Advice Not Given, renowned psychiatrist and author Dr Mark Epstein reveals how Buddhism and Western psychotherapy both identify the ego as the limiting factor in our wellbeing and both come to the same conclusion: when we give the ego free rein, we suffer; but when it learns to let go, we are free.    </p>
<p>                    Our ego is at once our biggest obstacle and our greatest hope. We can be at its mercy or we can learn to mould it. Completely unique and practical, Epstein&#8217;s advice can be used by all, and will provide wise counsel in a confusing world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new approach to mental disorder. Randolph Nesse&#8217;s insightful book  suggests that conditions such as anxiety and depression have a clear  evolutionary purpose &#8230; This intriguing book turns some age-old  questions about the human condition upside down&#8217; Tim Adams, Observer    </p>
<p>                    One of the world&#8217;s most respected psychiatrists provides a much-needed new evolutionary framework for making sense of mental illness    </p>
<p>                    With his classic book Why We Get Sick, Randolph Nesse established the field of evolutionary medicine. Now he returns with a book that transforms our understanding of mental disorders by exploring a fundamentally new question. Instead of asking why certain people suffer from mental illness, Nesse asks why natural selection has left us with fragile minds at all.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on revealing stories from his own clinical practice and insights from evolutionary biology, Nesse shows how negative emotions are useful in certain situations, yet can become excessive. Anxiety protects us from harm in the face of danger, but false alarms are inevitable. Low mood prevents us from wasting effort in pursuit of unreachable goals, but it often escalates into pathological depression. Other mental disorders, such as addiction and anorexia, result from the mismatch between modern environments and our ancient human past. Taken together, these insights and many more help to explain the pervasiveness of human suffering, and show us new paths for relieving it.    </p>
<p>                    Good Reasons for Bad Feelings will fascinate anyone who wonders how our minds can be so powerful, yet so fragile, and how love and goodness came to exist in organisms shaped to maximize Darwinian fitness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Divided Self, R.D. Laing&#8217;s groundbreaking exploration of the nature of madness, illuminated the nature of mental illness and made the mysteries of the mind comprehensible to a wide audience.     </p>
<p>                    First published in 1960, this watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the &#8216;divided self&#8217;, or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, &#8216;sane&#8217; self that we present to the world.     </p>
<p>                    Laing&#8217;s radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment.    </p>
<p>                    Includes an introduction by Professor Anthony S. David.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of the twentieth century&#8217;s most influential psychotherapists&#8217;<br />
                    Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Laing challenged the psychiatric orthodoxy of his time &#8230; an icon of the 1960s counter-culture&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The inspiration for the PBS series Mysterious of Mental Illness, Shrinks brilliantly tells the &#8220;astonishing&#8221; story of psychiatry&#8217;s origins, demise, and redemption (Siddhartha Mukherjee).      </p>
<p>                    Psychiatry has come a long way since the days of chaining &#8220;lunatics&#8221; in cold cells and parading them as freakish marvels before a gaping public.     </p>
<p>                    But, as Jeffrey Lieberman, MD, the former president of the American Psychiatric Association, reveals in his extraordinary and eye-opening book, the path to legitimacy for &#8220;the black sheep of medicine&#8221; has been anything but smooth.     </p>
<p>                    In Shrinks, Dr. Lieberman traces the field from its birth as a mystic pseudo-science through its adolescence as a cult of &#8220;shrinks&#8221; to its late blooming maturity &#8212; beginning after World War II &#8212; as a science-driven profession that saves lives. With fascinating case studies and portraits of the luminaries of the field &#8212; from Sigmund Freud to Eric Kandel &#8212; Shrinks is a gripping and illuminating read, and an urgent call-to-arms to dispel the stigma of mental illnesses by treating them as diseases rather than unfortunate states of mind.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;A lucid popular history&#8230;At once skeptical and triumphalist. It shows just how far psychiatry has come.&#8221; &#8211;Julia M. Klein, Boston Globe</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Updated with bonus material, including a new foreword and afterword with new research, this New York Times bestseller is essential reading for a time when mental health is constantly in the news.     </p>
<p>                    In this astonishing and startling book, award-winning science and history writer Robert Whitaker investigates a medical mystery: Why has the number of disabled mentally ill in the United States tripled over the past two decades?     </p>
<p>                    Interwoven with Whitaker&#8217;s groundbreaking analysis of the merits of psychiatric medications are the personal stories of children and adults swept up in this epidemic. As Anatomy of an Epidemic reveals, other societies have begun to alter their use of psychiatric medications and are now reporting much improved outcomes . . . so why can&#8217;t such change happen here in the United States? Why have the results from these long-term studies&#8211;all of which point to the same startling conclusion&#8211;been kept from the public?     </p>
<p>                    Our nation has been hit by an epidemic of disabling mental illness, and yet, as Anatomy of an Epidemic reveals, the medical blueprints for curbing that epidemic have already been drawn up.     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Anatomy of an Epidemic     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The timing of Robert Whitaker&#8217;s Anatomy of an Epidemic, a comprehensive and highly readable history of psychiatry in the United States, couldn&#8217;t be better.&#8221;&#8211;Salon     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Anatomy of an Epidemic offers some answers, charting controversial ground with mystery-novel pacing.&#8221;&#8211;TIME     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Lucid, pointed and important, Anatomy of an Epidemic should be required reading for anyone considering extended use of psychiatric medicine. Whitaker is at the height of his powers.&#8221; &#8211;Greg Critser, author of Generation Rx</p>
