<p>                    As the &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221; and its aftermath sweep streets and squares, parliaments and presidential palaces of the Middle East, Shereen El Feki&#8211;an award-winning Canadian-Egyptian journalist&#8211;has been looking at unrest a little closer to home: in the sexual lives of Arab men and women. The result is an informative, insightful, and engaging account of this sensitive and still largely secret aspect of Arab society.     </p>
<p>                     Sexual attitudes and behaviors are shaped by politics and economics, religion and tradition, gender and generations&#8211;not only a reflection of the conditions that led to the uprisings, but also a measure of hard-won reforms in the years to come. Highly personal, rich with original research and remarkable stories, Sex and the Citadel gives us unprecedented and timely insight into a part of the world that is changing before our eyes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revised and updated edition of Emily Nagoski&#8217;s game-changing New York Times bestseller Come As You Are, featuring new information and research on mindfulness, desire, and pleasure that will radically transform your sex life.     </p>
<p>                    For much of the 20th and 21st centuries, women&#8217;s sexuality was an uncharted territory in science, studied far less frequently&#8211;and far less seriously&#8211;than its male counterpart.     </p>
<p>                    That is, until Emily Nagoski&#8217;s Come As You Are, which used groundbreaking science and research to prove that the most important factor in creating and sustaining a sex life filled with confidence and joy is not what the parts are or how they&#8217;re organized but how you feel about them. In the years since the book&#8217;s initial publication, countless women have learned through Nagoski&#8217;s accessible and informative guide that things like stress, mood, trust, and body image are not peripheral factors in a woman&#8217;s sexual wellbeing; they are central to it&#8211;and that even if you don&#8217;t always feel like it, you are already sexually whole by just being yourself. This revised and updated edition continues that mission with new information and advanced research, demystifying and decoding the science of sex so that everyone can create a better sex life and discover more pleasure than you ever thought possible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of reproduction, and its variants, never change much, but our ideas about the meaning of sex are in constant flux. Switch a decade, cross a border, or traverse class lines and the harmless pleasures of one group become the gravest crimes in another.     </p>
<p>                    Combining meticulous research and lively storytelling, The Boundaries of Desire traces the fast-moving bloodsport of sex law over the past century, and challenges our most cherished notions about family, power, gender, and identity.     </p>
<p>                    Starting when courts censored birth control information as pornography and let men rape their wives, and continuing through the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; and into the present day (when rape, gay rights, sex trafficking, and sex on the internet saturate the news), Berkowitz shows how the law has remained out of synch with the convulsive changes in sexual morality.     </p>
<p>                    By focusing on the stories of real people, Berkowitz adds a compelling human element to what might otherwise be faceless legal battles. The law is made by people, after all, and nothing sparks intolerance &#8211; on the left and right &#8212; more than sex. Ultimately, Berkowitz shows the emptiness of sanctimonious condemnation, and argues that sexual questions are too subtle and volatile for simple, catch-all solutions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next Generation Indie Book Awards Winner in LGBT . &#8220;An important resource for readers of any age who are struggling to understand their sexual orientation, or those who would like to better understand asexuality.&#8221; -Library Journal, starred review<br />
                    Julie Sondra Decker&#8217;s book functions as a starting point for people interested in asexuality. It covers the basics of what asexuality is and isn&#8217;t, explores the most common issues asexual people may be dealing with, presents some pointers for newly asexual-identified people and the people who love them, and includes some resources to find out more. It&#8217;s for the layperson, written in everyday language.    </p>
<p>                    She writes for people who are on the asexual spectrum, people who think they might be asexual, friends and family and partners of people who have come out as asexual, curious parties, and those looking for information on the subject for their school papers, sexuality studies, and alternative sexuality resources. And it&#8217;s for people who think asexuality doesn&#8217;t exist. Chapters include:    </p>
<p>                    Asexuality as a Sexual Orientation<br />
                    Romantic Orientation<br />
                    Libido and Masturbation<br />
                    Intimate and Sexual Activity<br />
                    Asexual Relationships<br />
                    Asexual Community<br />
                    Should Asexual People Get Therapy and Be Fixed<br />
                    Am I Asexual?<br />
                    Should I Come Out?<br />
                    And much more    </p>
<p>                    If you think you may be asexual, or if you have a friend or partner who may be a sexual, this personal book will help you better understand what it means to be asexual in a world dominated by sexuality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why didn&#8217;t he call you back? Why doesn&#8217;t he talk to your friends? Why does he keep putting off your dates? This book has the answers. Now the international bestseller is re-released to change the lives of a new generation.    </p>
<p>                              This is a hilarious, playful, honest explanation of male behaviour from a writer and a consultant of Sex and the City. Stop wasting your time chasing after men who aren&#8217;t into you, and find men who are! Greg Behrendt provides the insight you need to move on and find them.    </p>
<p>                              The idea behind &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; came from a conversation between Greg Behrendt and his fellow (female) SATC writers, when they asked his advice one day. This conversation became the seed of an episode which struck a powerful chord with viewers. Before long, Greg became aware that this simple phrase had the power to change women&#8217;s lives.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You&#8217; is now a worldwide phenomenon. Over 100k copies have been sold across all editions, it has topped bestseller charts internationally, and has been made into a major Hollywood film. Now repackaged for a new generation with an eyecatching new cover, He&#8217;s Just Not That Into You is essential armour for the modern woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating insight into how human sexuality came to be the way it is now &#8211; Jared Diamond explains why we are different from the animal kingdom.    </p>
<p>                    Why are humans one of the few species to have sex in private? Why do humans have sex any day of the month or year, including when the female is pregnant, beyond her reproductive years, or between her fertile cycles? Why are human females one of the few mammals to go through menopause?    </p>
<p>                    Human sexuality seems normal to us but it is bizarre by the standards of other animals. Jared Diamond argues that our strange sex lives were as crucial to our rise to human status as were our large brains. He also describes the battle of the sexes in the human and animal world over parental care, and why sex differences in the genetic value of parental care provide a biological basis for the all-too-familiar different attitudes of men and women towards extramarital sex.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rigorous and supremely honest book Alain de Botton helps us navigate the intimate and exciting &#8211; yet often confusing and difficult &#8211; experience that is sex. Few of us tend to feel we&#8217;re entirely normal when it comes to sex, and what we&#8217;re supposed to be feeling rarely matches up with the reality. This book argues that 21st-century sex is ultimately fated to be a balancing act between love and desire, and adventure and commitment. Covering topics that include lust, fetishism, adultery and pornography, Alain de Botton frankly articulates the dilemmas of modern sexuality, offering insights and consolation to help us think more deeply and wisely about the sex we are, or aren&#8217;t, having.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years after the sexual revolution, we are told that we live in a time of unprecedented sexual freedom; that if anything, we are too free now. But beneath the veneer of glossy hedonism, millennial journalist Rachel Hills argues that we are controlled by a new brand of sexual convention: one which influences all of us-woman or man, straight or gay, liberal or conservative. At the root of this silent code lies the Sex Myth-the defining significance we invest in sexuality that once meant we were dirty if we didhave sex, and now means we are defective if we don&#8217;tdo it enough.     </p>
<p>                    Equal parts social commentary, pop culture, and powerful personal anecdotes from people across the English-speaking world, The Sex Mythexposes the invisible norms and unspoken assumptions that shape the way we think about sex today.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Cuts to the heart of who we are&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                    &#8216;A book that begs discussion&#8217; Vanity Fair    </p>
<p>                    All Lina wanted was to be desired. How did she end up in a marriage with two children and a husband who wouldn&#8217;t touch her?    </p>
<p>                    All Maggie wanted was to be understood. How did she end up in a relationship with her teacher and then in court, a hated pariah in her small town?    </p>
<p>                    All Sloane wanted was to be admired. How did she end up a sexual object of men, including her husband, who liked to watch her have sex with other men and women?    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I will probably re-read it every year of my life&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you love someone, how does it feel? And when you desire someone, how is it different?     </p>
<p>                    In Mating in Captivity, Esther Perel looks at the story of sex in committed couples. Modern romance promises it all &#8211; a lifetime of togetherness, intimacy and erotic desire. In reality, it&#8217;s hard to want what you already have. Our quest for secure love conflicts with our pursuit of passion. And often, the very thing that got us to into our relationships &#8211; lust &#8211; is the one thing that goes missing from them.     </p>
<p>                    Determined to reconcile the erotic and the domestic, Perel explains why democracy is a passion killer in the bedroom. Argues for playfulness, distance, and uncertainty. And shows what it takes to bring lust home. Smart, sexy and explosively original, Mating in Captivity is the monogamist&#8217;s essential bedside read.</p>

<p>                    A groundbreaking method for improving desire, arousal, and sexual satisfaction through mindfulness.     </p>
<p>                    Studies show that approximately half of all women experience some kind of sexual difficulty at one point in their lives, with lack of interest in sex being by far the most common and the most distressing. And when sex suffers, so do all other areas of life.    </p>
<p>                    But it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way. In Better Sex through Mindfulness, acclaimed psychologist and sex researcher Lori A. Brotto offers a revolutionary approach to improving desire, arousal, and satisfaction inside and outside of the bedroom. A pioneer in the use of mindfulness for treating sexual difficulties, Brotto has helped hundreds of women cultivate more exciting, fulfilling sexual experiences.    </p>
<p>                    In this accessible, relatable book, she explores the various reasons for sexual problems, such as stress and incessant multitasking, and tells the stories of many of the women she has treated over the years. She also provides easy, effective exercises that readers can do on their own to increase desire and sexual enjoyment, whether their goal is to overcome a sexual difficulty or simply give their love life a boost.</p>
