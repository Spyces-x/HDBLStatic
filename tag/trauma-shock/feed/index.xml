<p>                    This groundbreaking book examines the cultural norms that impede resilience in America, especially our collective tendency to disconnect stress from its potentially extreme consequences and override our need to recover. It explains the science of how to direct our attention to perform under stress and recover from trauma, exploring how our survival brain and thinking brain react to traumatic situations differently.    </p>
<p>                    By directing our attention in particular ways, we can widen the window within which our thinking brain and survival brain work together cooperatively. When we use awareness to regulate our biology this way, we can access our best, uniquely human qualities: our compassion, courage, curiosity, creativity, and connection with others. By building our resilience, we can train ourselves to make wise decisions and access choice &#8211; even during times of incredible stress, uncertainty and change.    </p>
<p>                    With stories from men and women Dr Stanley has trained in settings as varied as military bases, healthcare facilities, as well as her own striking experiences with stress and trauma, she gives readers hands-on strategies they can use themselves, whether they want to perform under pressure or heal from traumatic experience, while at the same time pointing our understanding in a new direction.    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Bessel Van Der Kolk, bestselling author of The Body Keeps the Score.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Widen the Window is a comprehensive overview of stress and trauma, responses to it, and tools for healing and thriving. It&#8217;s not only for those in high-intensity work, but for everyone.&#8217; &#8211; Mindful Magazine</p>
