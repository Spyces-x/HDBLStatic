										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hill&#8217;s advice is straightforward and no-nonsense&#8217; &#8211; The Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A life-transforming book&#8230; fascinating &#8211; Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Maisie Hill has written a bloody brilliant book (pun intended). Everything you need to know about periods and how they affect you and your life is here. It&#8217;s revolutionary&#8217; &#8211; Miranda Sawyer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thank GOODNESS for Maisie Hill! Flipping open the lid on a vital conversation. It&#8217;s about time we claimed the power of our periods!&#8217; &#8211; Gemma Cairney, broadcaster &#038; co-founder of Boom Shakalaka Productions    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is such an important book. Maisie&#8217;s insights and cycle strategy have changed my life and my cycle. Period Power is written with such intelligence, humour and a deep understanding of women&#8217;s health. If you have a period you need to read this book.&#8217; &#8211; Anna Jones, author of The Modern Cook&#8217;s Year    </p>
<p>                    A profound and practical blueprint for aligning daily life with your menstrual cycle.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is the handbook to periods and hormones that will leave you wondering why the hell nobody told you this sooner.    </p>
<p>                    The hormones of the menstrual cycle profoundly influence our energy, mood and behaviour, but all too often we&#8217;re taught that our hormones make us unreliable, moody bitches, or that it&#8217;s our lot in life to put up with &#8216;women&#8217;s problems&#8217;. Maisie Hill, a women&#8217;s health practitioner, knows the power of working with the menstrual cycle and refuses to accept this theory. Instead, Maisie believes that our hormones are there to serve us and, if utilized correctly, can be used to help you get what you want out of life. Yes, we are hormonal, and that&#8217;s a very good thing.    </p>
<p>                    This revolutionary book reveals everything you need to know about taking control of your menstrual cycle and outlines The Cycle Strategy to help us perform at our best, throughout our cycle. In Period Power you will discover how to:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; maximise your natural superpowers each month while making adjustments for the darker days, and use Maisie&#8217;s favourite tips to improve them<br />
                    &#8211; identify your personal patterns, powers and pitfalls for each phase of the menstrual cycle<br />
                    &#8211; plan your month to perform at your best in all aspects of your life<br />
                    &#8211; figure out if you have a hormonal imbalance and what to do about it.    </p>
<p>                    Period Power is a no-nonsense guide with all the tools you need to improve your menstrual health.</p>
