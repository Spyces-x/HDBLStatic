										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if you could combine the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization?    </p>
<p>                    When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Iraq in 2003, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment and training &#8211; but none of the enemy&#8217;s speed and flexibility.    </p>
<p>                    McChrystal and his colleagues discarded a century of conventional wisdom to create a &#8216;team of teams&#8217; that combined extremely transparent communication with decentralized decision-making authority.     </p>
<p>                    Faster, flatter and more flexible, the task force beat back al-Qaeda.    </p>
<p>                    In this powerful book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be relevant to any leader. Through compelling examples, the authors demonstrate that the &#8216;team of teams&#8217; strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency rooms to NASA and has the potential to transform organizations large and small.    </p>

<p>                    New York Times Bestseller &#8211; Finalist for the PEN/Jean Stein Book Award, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize, and the Dayton Literary Peace Prize     </p>
<p>                     Named One of the Best Books of the Year by The New York Times &#8211; USA Today &#8211; Time &#8211; Los Angeles Times &#8211; San Francisco Chronicle &#8211; Essence &#8211; O: The Oprah Magazine &#8211; The Week &#8211; Kirkus Reviews     </p>
<p>                     *Kirkus Reviews (starred review)    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;We were eight years in power&#8221; was the lament of Reconstruction-era black politicians as the American experiment in multiracial democracy ended with the return of white supremacist rule in the South. In this sweeping collection of new and selected essays, Ta-Nehisi Coates explores the tragic echoes of that history in our own time: the unprecedented election of a black president followed by a vicious backlash that fueled the election of the man Coates argues is America&#8217;s &#8220;first white president.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     But the story of these present-day eight years is not just about presidential politics. This book also examines the new voices, ideas, and movements for justice that emerged over this period&#8211;and the effects of the persistent, haunting shadow of our nation&#8217;s old and unreconciled history. Coates powerfully examines the events of the Obama era from his intimate and revealing perspective&#8211;the point of view of a young writer who begins the journey in an unemployment office in Harlem and ends it in the Oval Office, interviewing a president.     </p>
<p>                     We Were Eight Years in Power features Coates&#8217;s iconic essays first published in The Atlantic,  including &#8220;Fear of a Black President,&#8221; &#8220;The Case for Reparations,&#8221; and &#8220;The Black Family in the Age of Mass Incarceration,&#8221; along with eight fresh essays that revisit each year of the Obama administration through Coates&#8217;s own experiences, observations, and intellectual development, capped by a bracingly original assessment of the election that fully illuminated the tragedy of the Obama era. We Were Eight Years in Power is a vital account of modern America, from one of the definitive voices of this historic moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The political memoir of the decade&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                                The referendum on Britain&#8217;s membership of the EU is one of the most controversial political events of our times. For the first time, the man who called that vote talks about the decision and its origins, as well as giving a candid account of his time at the top of British politics.    </p>
<p>                              David Cameron was Conservative Party leader during the largest financial crash in living memory. The Arab Spring and the Eurozone crisis both started during his first year as prime minister. The backdrop to his time in office included the advent of ISIS, surging migration and a rapidly changing EU.    </p>
<p>                              Here he talks about how he confronted those challenges, from modernising a party that had suffered three successive electoral defeats to forming the first coalition government for seventy years. He sets out how he helped turn around Britain&#8217;s economy, implementing a modern, compassionate agenda that included education and welfare reform, the legalisation of gay marriage, the referendum on Scottish independence and world-leading environmental policies.    </p>
<p>                              David Cameron is searingly honest about the key players from his time in politics. And he is frank about himself &#8211; the things he got right and the things he got wrong. He opens up about family life too, including the tragic loss of his eldest son.    </p>
<p>                              We learn why he kept Britain&#8217;s promise on overseas aid spending and what it was like to commit British troops to conflicts in Libya, Iraq and Syria. He sets out how he won the first outright Conservative majority in nearly a quarter of a century, and describes the events leading up to the EU referendum, the renegotiation, the campaign &#8211; and his thoughts on it all today.    </p>
<p>                              It is the most compelling record yet of what it&#8217;s like to lead in modern times and to live behind the most famous door in the world.</p>
