										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this fascinating foray into the millennia-long relationship between science and military power, acclaimed astrophysicist and &#8220;the world&#8217;s best science communicator&#8221; (Times Literary Supplement) Neil deGrasse Tyson and writer-researcher Avis Lang examine how the methods and tools of astrophysics have been enlisted in the service of war. &#8220;The overlap is strong, and the knowledge flows in both directions&#8221;, say the authors, because astrophysicists and military planners care about many of the same things: multi-spectral detection, ranging, tracking, imaging, high ground, nuclear fusion and access to space. Tyson and Lang call it a &#8220;curiously complicit&#8221; alliance. &#8220;The universe is both the ultimate frontier and the highest of high grounds&#8221;, they write. &#8220;Shared by both space scientists and space warriors, it&#8217;s a laboratory for one and a battlefield for the other. The explorer wants to understand it; the soldier wants to dominate it. But without the right technology-which is more or less the same technology for both parties-nobody can get to it, operate in it, scrutinise it, dominate it or use it to their advantage and someone else&#8217;s disadvantage.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                     Spanning early celestial navigation to satellite-enabled warfare, Accessory to War is a richly researched and provocative examination of the intersection of science, technology, industry and power that will introduce Tyson&#8217;s millions of fans to yet another dimension of how the universe has shaped our lives and our world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wildly vivid and entertaining chronicle of America&#8217;s manned space program, from the author of The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test    </p>
<p>                    `What is it&#8217; asks Tom Wolfe, `that makes a man willing to sit on top of an enormous Roman Candle&#8230;and wait for someone to light the fuse?&#8217; Arrogance? Stupidity? Bravery? Courage? Or, simply, that quality we call &#8216;the right stuff&#8217;?    </p>
<p>                    A monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space program, and a dizzying dive into the sweat, fear, beauty and danger of being on the white-hot edge of history in the making.    </p>
<p>                    `Tom Wolfe at his very best&#8230; Learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic&#8230;The Right Stuff is superb&#8217; &#8211; New York Times Book Review    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Magic takes many forms. The ancient Egyptians explained the night by suggesting that the goddess Nut swallowed the sun. The Vikings believed a rainbow was the gods&#8217; bridge to earth. These are magical, extraordinary tales. But there is another kind of magic, and it lies in the exhilaration of discovering the real answers to these questions. It is the magic of reality &#8211; science.    </p>
<p>                    Packed with inspiring explanations of space, time and evolution, laced with humour and clever thought experiments, The Magic of Reality explores a stunningly wide range of natural phenomena. What is stuff made of? How old is the universe? What causes tsunamis? Who was the first man, or woman? This is a page-turning, inspirational detective story that not only mines all the sciences for its clues but primes the reader to think like a scientist too.    </p>
<p>                    Richard Dawkins elucidates the wonders of the natural world to all ages with his inimitable clarity and exuberance in a text that will enlighten and inform for generations to come.</p>
