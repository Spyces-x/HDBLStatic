										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praise for The Macho Paradox</p>
<p>                    &#8220;An honest, intellectually rigorous and insightful work that challenges readers to truly engage in a political discourse that can change lives, communities and nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Rosalind Wiseman, author of Queen Bees and Wannabes</p>
<p>                    &#8220;Jackson Katz is an American hero! With integrity and courage, he has taken his message&#8211;that the epidemic of violence against women is a men&#8217;s issue&#8211;into athletic terms, the military and frat houses across the country. His book explains carefully and convincingly why&#8211;and how&#8211;men can become part of the solution, and work with women to build a world in which everyone is safer.&#8221; </p>
<p>                    &#8211;Michael Kimmel, author of Manhood in America, spokesperson, National Organization for Men Against Sexism (NOMAS)</p>
<p>                    &#8220;If only men would read Katz&#8217;s book, it could serve as a potent form of male consciousness-raising.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>
<p>                    &#8220;This book leaves no man behind when it comes to taking violence against women personally&#8230;.After reading this book you can see how important it is to be a stand-up guy and not a standy-by guy, no matter what race or culture you come from.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Alfred L. McMichael, 14th Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps and now serving as the Sergeant Major of NATO</p>
<p>                    &#8220;A candid look at the cultural factors that lend themselves to tolerance of abuse and violence against women.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Booklist</p>
<p>                    &#8220;These pages will empower both men and women to end the scourge of male violence and abuse. Katz knows how to cut to the core of the issues, demonstrating undeniably that stopping the degradation of women should be every man&#8217;s priority.&#8221;</p>
<p>                    &#8211;Lundy Bancroft, author of Why Does He Do That?: Inside the Minds of Angry and Controlling Men</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a dramatic account of violence and espionage, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter Ronan Farrow exposes serial abusers and a cabal of powerful interests hell-bent on covering up the truth, at any cost.</p>
<p>                    In 2017, a routine network television investigation led Ronan Farrow to a story only whispered about: one of Hollywood&#8217;s most powerful producers was a predator, protected by fear, wealth, and a conspiracy of silence. As Farrow drew closer to the truth, shadowy operatives, from high-priced lawyers to elite war-hardened spies, mounted a secret campaign of intimidation, threatening his career, following his every move and weaponizing an account of abuse in his own family. </p>
<p>                    All the while, Farrow and his producer faced a degree of resistance that could not be explained &#8211; until now. And a trail of clues revealed corruption and cover-ups from Hollywood, to Washington, and beyond. </p>
<p>                    This is the untold story of the exotic tactics of surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse &#8211; and it&#8217;s the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth and spark a global movement.</p>
<p>                    Both a spy thriller and a meticulous work of investigative journalism, Catch and Kill breaks devastating new stories about the rampant abuse of power &#8211; and sheds far-reaching light on investigations that shook the culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every seven minutes, someone in America commits a rape. And whether that&#8217;s a football star, beloved celebrity, elected official, member of the clergy, or just an average Joe (or Joanna), there&#8217;s probably a community eager to make excuses for that person.In  Asking for It , Kate Harding combines in-depth research with an in-your-face voice to make the case that twenty-first-century America supports rapists more effectively than it supports victims. Drawing on real-world examples of what feminists call &#8220;rape culture&#8221;,from politicos&#8217; revealing gaffes to institutional failures in higher education and the military,Harding offers ideas and suggestions for how we, as a society, can take sexual violence much more seriously without compromising the rights of the accused.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLING MEMOIR     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Incredibly moving and haunting&#8217; Roxane Gay<br />
                    &#8216;I read this book cover to cover and it stunned me&#8217; Jia Tolentino<br />
                    &#8216;Powerful, honest and necessary&#8217; Marian Keyes    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To girls everywhere, I am with you. On nights when you feel alone, I am with you. When people doubt you or dismiss you, I am with you. I fought every day for you. So never stop fighting, I believe you.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Chanel Miller&#8217;s story changed our world forever. In 2016 Brock Turner was sentenced to just six months in jail after he was caught sexually assaulting her on Stanford&#8217;s campus. His light sentencing, and Chanel&#8217;s victim impact statement, which was read by eleven million people in four days, sparked international outrage and action.    </p>
<p>                    Know My Name is an intimate, profoundly moving memoir that exposes a patriarchal culture biased to protect perpetrators, a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable, and ultimately shines with the courage required to move through suffering and live a full and beautiful life. Entwining pain, resilience, and humour, this breath-taking memoir will stand as a modern classic.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I could not put this phenomenal book down&#8217; Glennon Doyle, bestselling author of UNTAMED    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;To read Know My Name inspires hope&#8217; Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A searing, beautiful book&#8217; Sunday Times      </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Know My Name marks the debut of a gifted young writer. Miller&#8217;s words are purpose. They are maps. And she is a treasure who has prevailed&#8217; New York Times</p>
