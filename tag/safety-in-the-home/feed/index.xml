										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes a narcissist go from self-involved to terrifying? In this national bestseller, Joe Navarro, a leading FBI profiler, unlocks the secrets to the personality disorders that put us all at risk.      </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I should have known.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;How could we have missed the warning signs?&#8221;<br />
                    &#8220;I always thought there was something off about him.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    When we wake up to new tragedies in the news every day&#8211;shootings, rampages, acts of domestic terrorism&#8211;we often blame ourselves for missing the mania lurking inside unsuspecting individuals. But how could we have known that the charismatic leader had the characteristics of a tyrant? And how can ordinary people identify threats from those who are poised to devastate their lives on a daily basis&#8211;the crazy coworkers, out-of-control family members, or relentless neighbors?     </p>
<p>                    In Dangerous Personalities, former FBI profiler Joe Navarro has the answers. He shows us how to identify the four most common dangerous personalities&#8211;the Narcissist, the Predator, the Paranoid, and the Unstable Personality&#8211; and how to analyze the potential threat level. Along the way, he provides essential tips and tricks to protect ourselves both immediately and in the long-term, as well as how to heal the trauma of being exposed to the destructive egos in our world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the moment radiation was discovered in the late nineteenth century, nuclear science has had a rich history of innovative scientific exploration and discovery, coupled with mistakes, accidents, and downright disasters.    </p>
<p>                     Mahaffey, a long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy, looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns.    </p>
<p>                     Every incident has lead to new facets in understanding about the mighty atom-and Mahaffey puts forth what the future should be for this final frontier of science that still holds so much promise.</p>
