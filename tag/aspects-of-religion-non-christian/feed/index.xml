										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Walking in the Dust of Rabbi Jesus, Lois Tverberg challenges readers to follow their Rabbi more closely by reexamining his words in the light of their Jewish context. Doing so will provide a richer, deeper understanding of his ministry, compelling us to live differently, to become more Christ-like. We&#8217;ll begin to understand why his first Jewish disciples abandoned everything to follow him, to live out his commands.    </p>
<p>                    Our modern society, with its individualism and materialism, is very different than the tight-knit, family-oriented setting Jesus lived and taught in. What wisdom can we glean from his Eastern, biblical attitude toward life? How can knowing Jesus within this context shed light on his teachings for us today?    </p>
<p>                    In Walking in the Dust of Rabbi Jesus we&#8217;ll journey back in time to eavesdrop on the conversations that arose among the rabbis of Jesus&#8217; day, and consider how hearing Rabbi Jesus with the ears of a first-century disciple can bring new meaning to our faith. And we&#8217;ll listen to Jewish thinkers through the ages, discovering how ideas that germinated in Jesus&#8217; time have borne fruit. Doing so will yield fresh, practical insights for following our Rabbi&#8217;s teachings from a Jewish point of view.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Biblical Foundation for the Best-selling Left Behind Series . . . In the twinkling of an eye, millions of people across the world vanish, resulting in highway catastrophes, plane crashes, utility breakdowns, and more. Chaos reigns. With the stage set, a dictator emerges who persecutes Christians horribly. But tribulation is about to give way to incredible joy &#8212; for the return of the King of Kings is at hand. In Revelation Unveiled, Dr. Tim LaHaye, co-author with Jerry Jenkins of the best-selling novels Left Behind and Tribulation Force, reveals the scriptural foundation of this series. Revelation Unveiled explains such critical topics as: &#8211; The rapture of the church &#8211; The Return of Christ &#8211; The Great Tribulation &#8211; The Final Battle against Satan and His Hosts &#8211; The Seven Seals &#8211; The Millenial Reign &#8211; The Seven Trumpets &#8211; The Seven Bowls of Wrath &#8211; The Great White Throne &#8211; The Destruction of Babylon &#8211; The New Heaven and New Earth &#8212; Previously titled Revelation Illustrated and Made Plain, this revised and updated commentary includes numerous charts. With simple and accessible language, Revelation Unveiled will help you better understand this mysterious, final book of the Bible and its implications.</p>
