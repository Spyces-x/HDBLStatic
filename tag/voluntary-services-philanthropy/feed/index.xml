<p>                    &#8216;Superb, hugely enjoyable &#8230; a spirited examination of the hubris and  hypocrisy of the super-rich who claim they are helping the world&#8217; Aditya  Chakrabortty, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    What explains the spreading backlash against the global elite? In this revelatory investigation, Anand Giridharadas takes us into the inner sanctums of a new gilded age, showing how the elite follow a &#8216;win-win&#8217; logic, fighting for equality and justice any way they can &#8211; except ways that threaten their position at the top.     </p>
<p>                    But why should our gravest problems be solved by consultancies, technology companies and corporate-sponsored charities instead of public institutions and elected officials? Why should we rely on scraps from the winners? Trenchant and gripping, this is an indispensable guide and call to action for elites and citizens alike.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here we drink three cups of tea to do business; the first you are a stranger, the second you become a friend, and the third, you join our family, and for our family we are prepared to do anything &#8211; even die.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Haji Ali, Korphe Village Chief, Karakoram mountains, Pakistan    </p>
<p>                     In 1993, after a terrifying and disastrous attempt to climb K2, a mountaineer called Greg Mortenson drifted, cold and dehydrated, into an impoverished Pakistan village in the Karakoram Mountains. Moved by the inhabitants&#8217; kindness, he promised to return and build a school. Three Cups of Tea is the story of that promise and its extraordinary outcome. Over the next decade Mortenson built not just one but fifty-five schools &#8211; especially for girls &#8211; in remote villages across the forbidding and breathtaking landscape of Pakistan and Afghanistan, just as the Taliban rose to power. His story is at once a riveting adventure and a testament to the power of the humanitarian spirit.    </p>
