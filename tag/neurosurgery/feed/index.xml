										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The award-winning New York Times bestseller that inspired BTS&#8217;s K-pop song &#8216;Magic Shop&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    The day that 12-year-old James Doty walked in to his local magic shop is the day that changed his life.     </p>
<p>                    Once the neglected son of an alcoholic father and a mother with chronic depression, he has gone on to become a leading neurosurgeon, based at Stanford University. He credits Ruth for this incredible turnaround: the remarkable woman he met at the Cactus Rabbit Magic Shop, who devoted the summer to transforming his mind and opening his heart.    </p>
<p>                    In this uplifting memoir, Jim explains the visualisation techniques Ruth taught him that gave him the self-esteem to imagine a new future for himself. He examines the science behind mindfulness and why the skills he learned &#8211; of focus and attention &#8211; now help him to think fast and keep calm in the operating theatre. And he shows us what is possible when you start to change your brain and your heart. Into the Magic Shop imparts some powerful life lessons about how to live better, and inspires us to believe that we all have inside us the capacity to change our own destiny.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I&#8217;m sure many readers will be moved by this inspiring story to open their hearts and see what they too can do for others&#8217; &#8211; His Holiness the Dalai Lama</p>

                    *As heard on Chris Evans&#8217; Virgin Radio*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;You&#8217;re amazing I could talk to you (Rahul) all day&#8217; Chris Evans    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is a gripping new book&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    World-leading neuroscientist and neurosurgeon Dr Rahul Jandial draws on his years of work with patients suffering from the most extreme cases of brain damage, disorders and illnesses to reveal what they can tell us about the science of the mind.    </p>
<p>                    From a languages teacher who has to choose whether to lose her ability to speak Spanish or English after brain surgery, to a former TV exec, now homeless, who discovers that his life-altering despondency is the result of a tumour, to a fainting teen who learns that deep breathing can mean the difference between life or death, these stories uncover the secret workings of the brain.    </p>
<p>                    Blending cutting-edge research and beautiful storytelling, Life Lessons from a Brain Surgeon is a vital resource on the best ways to boost your memory, control stress and emotions, minimize pain, unleash your creativity, raise smart kids and reduce the risk of Alzheimer&#8217;s. This is a deeply practical and readable book, which will take you on an expedition through the anatomy of the most fascinating &#8211; and mysterious &#8211; of organs.    </p>
<p>                    Rahul&#8217;s new book Life on a Knife&#8217;s Edge is out now.</p>
