										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling The Hunger Games, with an all-new cover from the major motion picture!<br />
                    The astonishing bestseller is now a blockbuster movie. Here is the original novel with new movie artwork on the cover. (Original cover version also available.) In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Reptile Room the siblings endure a car accident, a terrible smell, a deadly serpent, a long knife, a brass reading lamp, and the re-appearance of a person they&#8217;d hoped never to see again.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>

<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>

<p>                              You still have time to choose another international best-seller to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on &#8230;</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Vile Village the siblings face such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe cell, and some very strange hats.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series &#8211; set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>                    Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in  their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother,  Gaea. Her giants have risen &#8211; all of them &#8211; and they&#8217;re stronger than ever. </p>
<p>                    They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods  sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus &#8211; in order to  wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp  Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost  within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to  Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs  back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps.  The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.</p>
<p>                    The gods, still  suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of  young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea&#8217;s army of powerful giants? As  dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have  sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over&#8230;</p>
<p>                            Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Austere Academy the siblings face snapping crabs, strict punishments, dripping fungus, comprehensive exams, violin recitals, S.O.R.E. and the metric system.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>

<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All The Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Ersatz Elevatorthe siblings face a darkened staircase, a red herring, friends in a dire situation, three mysterious initials, a liar with an evil scheme, a secret passageway and parsley soda.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times bestselling author of the Sisters Grimm and NERDS comes the second book in an action-packed middle grade series with equal parts humor and heart!     </p>
<p>                    When Finn is saved from the Time Rangers by an older version of himself, it comes with a catch. Old Man Finn needs Finn and his friends, Lincoln and Julep, to help him win battles he lost years ago against the Paradox, a terrible creatures obsessed with revenge against Finn&#8217;s father. If they succeed, he promises to tell Finn where his father is. He even gives them a pair of time-traveling pajamas to help them with their quest.     </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s only one problem. The pajamas malfunction almost immediately. Along the way the kids avoid being eaten by sabretooths, shot by revolutionary war soldiers, and start a war with a town full of holograms, all in an effort to fix the jammies.     </p>
<p>                    Just when their goal is in sight, Julep gets sick. Only&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t seem like she&#8217;s sick. It seems like she&#8217;s changing. The adventure may cost Finn more than an old pair of pajamas&#8211;it may cost him his friends!    </p>

                    The second installment in Rick Riordan&#8217;s blockbuster Norse mythology series has Magnus and friends helping the god of thunder find his missing weapon before all Muspellheim breaks loose.<br />
                    Thor&#8217;s hammer is missing again. The thunder god has a disturbing habit of misplacing his weapon&#8211;the mightiest force in the Nine Worlds. But this time the hammer isn&#8217;t just lost, it has fallen into enemy hands.<br />
                    If Magnus Chase and his friends can&#8217;t retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn.<br />
                    Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer&#8217;s return is the gods&#8217; worst enemy, Loki&#8211;and the price he wants is very high.    </p>

<p>                    EVER since the gods of Ancient Egypt were unleashed on the modern world, Carter Kane and his sister, Sadie, have been in big trouble.</p>
<p>                    As descendants of the magical House of Life, they command certain powers. But now a terrifying enemy &#8211; Apophis, the giant snake of chaos &#8211; is rising. </p>
<p>                    If Carter and Sadie don&#8217;t destroy him, the world will end in five days&#8217; time. And in order to battle the forces of chaos, they must revive the sun god Ra &#8211; a feat no magician has ever achieved. Because first they must search the world for the three sections of the Book of Ra, then they have to learn how to chant its spells . . .</p>
<p>                    Can the Kanes destroy Apophis before he swallows the sun and plunges the earth into darkness . . . forever?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>William Golding&#8217;s Lord of the Flies is a dystopian classic: &#8216;exciting, relevant and thought-provoking&#8217; (Stephen King). When a group of schoolboys are stranded on a desert island, what could go wrong?</p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of my favorite books &#8211; I read it every couple of years.&#8217; (Suzanne Collins, author of The Hunger Games)</p>
<p>                    A plane crashes on a desert island. The only survivors are a group of schoolboys. By day, they discover fantastic wildlife and dazzling beaches, learning to survive; at night, they are haunted by nightmares of a primitive beast. Orphaned by society, it isn&#8217;t long before their innocent childhood games devolve into a savage, murderous hunt &#8230; </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Stands out mightily in my memory &#8230; Such a strong statement about the human heart.&#8217; (Patricia Cornwell)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Terrifying and haunting.&#8217; (Kingsley Amis)</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Beautifully written, tragic and provocative.&#8217; (E. M. Forster)</p>
<p>                    ONE OF THE BBC&#8217;S ICONIC &#8216;NOVELS THAT SHAPED OUR WORLD&#8217;</p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Every real human being should read this &#8230; This is what we are.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s brilliant, it&#8217;s captivating, it&#8217;s thought provoking and brutal and for some, its truly terrifying.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;It can be read and re-read many times, and every time something new will appear.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;There is a reason why this is studied at school &#8230; Excellent read.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is one of the few books I&#8217;ve read that I keep on my Kindle to read again.&#8217;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I revisit this every few years and it&#8217;s always fresh and impressive &#8230; One of the best books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217;</p>

<p>                    Not so very long ago, Eragon &#8211; Shadeslayer, Dragon Rider &#8211; was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now, the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.    </p>
<p>                    Long months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.     </p>
<p>                    The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaesia? And if so, at what cost?    </p>
<p>                    Featuring spectacular artwork by cult artist John Jude Palencar, this stunning book brings the bestselling Inheritance cycle to a breathtaking conclusion.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life preservers are mandatory for this wet, wild, and wondrous adventure, the third entry in Rick Riordan&#8217;s New York Times #1 best-selling Norse mythology trilogy, which features a cameo from Percy Jackson.<br />
                    Magnus Chase, a once-homeless teen, is a resident of the Hotel Valhalla and one of Odin&#8217;s chosen warriors. As the son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus isn&#8217;t naturally inclined to fighting. But he has strong and steadfast friends, including Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, and Samirah the Valkyrie, and together they have achieved brave deeds, such as defeating Fenris Wolf and battling giants for Thor&#8217;s hammer, Mjolnir. Now Magnus faces his most dangerous trial yet. His cousin, Annabeth, recruits her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, to give Magnus some pointers, but will his training be enough?<br />
                    Loki is free from his chains. He&#8217;s readying Naglfar, the Ship of the Dead, complete with a host of giants and zombies, to sail against the Asgardian gods and begin the final battle of Ragnarok. It&#8217;s up to Magnus and his friends to stop him, but to do so they will have to sail across the oceans of Midgard, Jotunheim, and Niflheim in a desperate race to reach Naglfar before it&#8217;s ready to sail.<br />
                    Along the way, they will face angry sea gods, hostile giants, and an evil fire-breathing dragon. Magnus&#8217;s biggest challenge will be facing his own inner demons. Does he have what it takes to outwit the wily trickster god?    </p>

<p>                    #1 New York Times bestselling author Stephen King&#8217;s timeless novella &#8220;The Body&#8221;&#8211;originally published in his 1982 short story collection Different Seasons, and adapted into the 1986 film classic Stand by Me&#8211;is now available as a stand-alone publication.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s 1960 in the fictional town of Castle Rock, Maine. Ray Brower, a boy from a nearby town, has disappeared, and twelve-year-old Gordie Lachance and his three friends set out on a quest to find his body along the railroad tracks. During the course of their journey, Gordie, Chris Chambers, Teddy Duchamp, and Vern Tessio come to terms with death and the harsh truths of growing up in a small factory town that doesn&#8217;t offer much in the way of a future.     </p>
<p>                    A timeless exploration of the loneliness and isolation of young adulthood, Stephen King&#8217;s The Body is an iconic, unforgettable, coming-of-age story.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Carl Hiaasen takes us deep in the Everglades with an eccentric eco-avenger, a ticked-off panther, and two kids on a mission to find their missing teacher. Florida&#8211;where the animals are wild and the people are wilder! </p>
<p>                    Bunny Starch, the most feared biology teacher ever, is missing. She disappeared after a school field trip to Black Vine Swamp. And, to be honest, the kids in her class are relieved. </p>
<p>                    But when the principal tries to tell the students that Mrs. Starch has been called away on a family emergency, Nick and Marta just don&#8217;t buy it. No, they figure the class delinquent, Smoke, has something to do with her disappearance. </p>
<p>                    And he does! But not in the way they think. There&#8217;s a lot more going on in Black Vine Swamp than any one player in this twisted tale can see. It&#8217;s all about to hit the fan, and when it does, the bad guys better scat. </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Ingenious . . . Scat won&#8217;t disappoint Hiaasenphiles of any age.&#8221; &#8211;The New York Times </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Woohoo! It&#8217;s time for another trip to Florida&#8211;screwy, gorgeous Florida, with its swamps and scammers and strange creatures (two- and four-legged). Our guide, of course, is Carl Hiaasen.&#8221; &#8211;DenverPost.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to an awful camp orientation video created by the god Apollo, Percy Jackson and other residents of Camp Half-Blood answer such questions as What is this place? and Do I get to keep the T-shirt? Newbies can check out the section on the Divine Cabins, read up on Magical Landmarks, and consult the chapter of Training Arenas.<br />
                    But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there. For instance, campers do not always co-exist in peace and harmony. The camp is not run with superior efficiency. Prophecies do not flow forth with great regularity.<br />
                    Sprinkled throughout are stories from heroes who have called Camp Half-Blood home or just passed through on their way to places unknown. Chiron himself introduces the book with a brief history of training based on his millennia of experience. And, of course, there are divine words of wisdom from the god Apollo himself, because . . . well, because the demigod authors would prefer not to be struck down, thank you very much.    </p>

<p>                    Enola Holmes&#8211;younger sister to Sherlock Holmes&#8211;is back on another case! </p>
<p>                    Everyone knows Dr. Watson is Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s right-hand man, so when he goes missing, it&#8217;s a shock. Even Sherlock hasn&#8217;t the slightest clue as to where he could be. Enola is intrigued but wary; she&#8217;s still hiding from her older brothers, and getting involved could prove to be disastrous. But Enola can&#8217;t help but investigate, especially when she learns that a bizarre bouquet&#8211;with flowers all symbolizing death&#8211;has been delivered to the Watson residence. Enola knows she must act quickly, but can she find Dr. Watson in time?</p>
<p>                    Praise for Enola Holmes: The Case of the Missing Marquess </p>

Only the top four students at the International Race School will qualify to compete in the New York Masters, the most prestigious race on the pro circuit, and the accident has cost Jason more than precious points in the standings.     </p>
<p>                     It&#8217;s also undermined his confidence, and Jason&#8217;s rivals are more than willing to take advantage of his weakness to knock him out of the running. Jason will have to outthink as well as outrace the competition to get to New York &#8212; and the toughest race of his life.    </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    I look like a normal kid. Only there&#8217;s a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me. </p>
<p>                    Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball. </p>
<p>                    This time, we&#8217;re under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we&#8217;ll be invaded by monsters. Big ones. </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />
                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    Normally when you turn sixteen you get a really cool present. </p>
<p>                    But, being sixteen and the son of Poseidon can never be that simple. So instead, I get a prophecy that says the fate of the entire world on my shoulders. Great. </p>
<p>                    On top of that, Kronos, Lord of the Titans, is attacking New York City and the dreaded monster Typhon is heading our way. So, it&#8217;s me and forty of my demi-god friends versus untold evil.</p>
<p>                    Happy birthday to me! </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a war of gods and tyrants, the will of the dragonrider must never falter.Captured and tortured by the brutal tyrant, Argonox, Reigh&#8217;s worst fears have now been realized. Argonox has successfully twisted his mysterious dark power for a truly evil purpose&#8211;reanimating the long-deceased legendary dragonrider, Beckah Derrick, and her monstrous king drake. But Argonox&#8217;s cruelty won&#8217;t end there, and Reigh fears the worst is yet to come. Rescue is unlikely as the Tibrans prepare to make their final strike, poised to break Maldobar&#8217;s ranks of proud dragonriders once and for all.With many of its cities already captured by the Tibran Empire, all hope now rests with Jaevid, Princess Jenna, Phillip, and their mismatched band of dragonrider allies to lead the last stand and save their kingdom. Even in such frightful times, Jaevid may find he still has a few old friends ready to take up their weapons and stand at his side again. But facing down Beckah is perhaps the one thing that might break Jaevid&#8217;s resolve. Can he really strike down the woman he used to love in order to save the kingdom? One final battle will decide the fate of our heroes. Can the strength dragonrider prevail once again? Or will the Tibran Empire become Maldobar&#8217;s new legacy?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Potter has never been the star of a Quidditch team, scoring points while riding a broom far above the ground. He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A dark epic fantasy inspired by The Prince and the Pauper and the fairy tale The False Prince, from bestselling author C. J. Redwine. Perfect for fans of the Court of Thorns and Roses series and the Wrath and the Dawn duology, The Traitor Prince is a thrilling new standalone novel in the Ravenspire series.    </p>
<p>                    Javan Najafai, crown prince of Akram, has spent the last ten years at an elite boarding school, far away from his kingdom. But his eagerly awaited return home is cut short when a mysterious impostor takes his place&#8211;and no one believes Javan is the true prince.    </p>
<p>                    After barely escaping the impostor&#8217;s assassins, Javan is thrown into Maqbara, the kingdom&#8217;s most dangerous prison. The only way to gain an audience with the king&#8211;and reveal Javan&#8217;s identity&#8211;is to fight in Maqbara&#8217;s yearly tournament. But winning is much harder than acing competitions at school, and soon Javan finds himself beset not just by the terrifying creatures in the arena but also by a band of prisoners allied against him, and even by the warden herself.    </p>
<p>                    The only person who can help him is Sajda, who has been enslaved by Maqbara&#8217;s warden since she was a child, and whose guarded demeanor and powerful right hook keep the prisoners in check. Working with Sajda might be the only way Javan can escape alive&#8211;but she has dangerous secrets.    </p>
<p>                    Together, Javan and Sajda have to outwit the vicious warden, outfight deadly creatures, and outlast the murderous prisoners intent on killing Javan. If they fail, they&#8217;ll be trapped in Maqbara for good&#8211;and the secret Sajda&#8217;s been hiding will bury them both.</p>

<p>                    Join us on this incredible time-travel adventure!     </p>
<p>                     Liberty, my wisecracking horse, our old friends Cam, Tommy, Freedom, and I are off to meet some super-brave soldiers in the year 1775. Yep, that&#8217;s right. We&#8217;ll be visiting with the underdog heroes who fought for American independence, against all odds&#8211;and won! But not before eight very real years of danger and uncertainty. Be a part of Rush Revere&#8217;s crew as we rush, rush, rush into a time when British rule had become a royal pain, and rebellion was in the air. We&#8217;ll be on hand to see two lanterns hung in the Old North Church, prevent a British spy from capturing Paul Revere, and grapple with danger at the battles of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.     </p>
<p>                     The extra special part of this trip is that right here in the twenty-first century, Cam&#8217;s dad is a soldier fighting in Afghanistan, and Cam has been pretty angry that he is away. Visiting with exceptional American heroes like Dr. Joseph Warren and George Washington, racing along after Paul Revere on his midnight ride, and seeing the Declaration of Independence signed make Cam see his own dad in a new and special way.     </p>
<p>                     But don&#8217;t worry. Along with the danger, excitement, and patriotism, there will still be time to stop for a delicious spinach, oats, and alfalfa smoothie. No, wait&#8211;that one&#8217;s for Liberty. The kids and I voted for strawberries.     </p>
<p>                     Now let&#8217;s open the magic portal to the past!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestselling dark epic fantasy inspired by the tale of Snow White, from C. J. Redwine, the author of the Defiance series. This breathtakingly romantic, action-packed fantasy is perfect for fans of A Court of Thorns and Roses and Cinder.     </p>
<p>                    Lorelai Diederich, crown princess and fugitive at large, has one mission: kill the wicked queen who took both the Ravenspire throne and the life of her father. To do that, Lorelai needs to use the one weapon she and Queen Irina have in common&#8211;magic. She&#8217;ll have to be stronger, faster, and more powerful than Irina, the most dangerous sorceress Ravenspire has ever seen.    </p>
<p>                    In the neighboring kingdom of Eldr, when Prince Kol&#8217;s father and older brother are killed by an invading army of magic-wielding ogres, the second-born prince is suddenly given the responsibility of saving his kingdom. To do that, Kol needs magic of his own&#8211;and the only way to get it is to make a deal with the queen of Ravenspire, promise to become her personal huntsman&#8211;and bring her Lorelai&#8217;s heart.    </p>
<p>                    But Lorelai is nothing like Kol expected&#8211;beautiful, fierce, and unstoppable&#8211;and despite dark magic, Lorelai is drawn in by the passionate and troubled king. Fighting to stay one step ahead of the dragon huntsman&#8211;who she likes far more than she should&#8211;Lorelai does everything in her power to ruin the wicked queen. But Irina isn&#8217;t going down without a fight, and her final move may cost the princess the one thing she still has left to lose.</p>

<p>                    There&#8217;s only one way he can earn back Zeus&#8217; favour, and that&#8217;s to seek and restore the ancient oracles &#8211; but that&#8217;s easier said than done. </p>
<p>                    Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave may hold answers. </p>
<p>                    There are a few things standing in his way though. The cave could kill him, or drive him insane. </p>
<p>                    Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame.</p>
<p>                    To stay alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood. </p>
<p>                    Will he survive the greatest challenge of his four thousand year existence?<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books 1-8 of the New York Times bestselling Magic Tree House series plus an interview with Mary Pope Osborne!</p>
<p>                    Meet Jack and Annie!</p>
<p>                    Jack and his younger sister, Annie, are just regular kids. But when they discover a tree house in the woods, something magical happens. In books 1-4, Jack and Annie are whisked back in time to the Age of Dinosaurs, a medieval castle, ancient pyramids, and treasure-seeking pirates. In books 5-8, Jack and Annie&#8217;s friend, Morgan le Fay, is in trouble! They must find four M things to free her from a spell. Their adventures take them to meet a ninja master in ancient Japan, flee a crocodile on the Amazon River, discover the cave people of the Ice Age, and blast off to the moon in the future. It&#8217;s a difficult and dangerous mission, but Jack and Annie will do anything to save a friend! </p>
<p>                    Audiobooks in this set include: Dinosaurs Before Dark (#1), The Knight at Dawn (#2), Mummies in the Morning (#3), Pirates Past Noon (#4), Night of the Ninjas (#5), Afternoon on the Amazon (#6), Sunset of the Sabertooth (#7), and Midnight on the Moon (#8). </p>
<p>                    Mary Pope Osborne brings together just the right combination of history, magic, and fast-paced adventure to satisfy kids, parents, teachers, and librarians all over the world with her New York Times bestselling series. </p>
<p>                    Osborne&#8217;s narration is low-key and well-paced. A great way to introduce children who are reluctant readers or can&#8217;t yet read to this highly entertaining book series and to reading in general.&#8211;Chicago Parent</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Osborne&#8217;s soothing, beautifully articulated voice and knack for characterization are reliably pleasing.&#8211;AudioFile</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Prepare to be spellbound by Jim Kay&#8217;s dazzling depiction of the wizarding world and much loved characters in this full-colour illustrated hardback edition of the nation&#8217;s favourite children&#8217;s book &#8211; Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#8217;s Stone. Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling&#8217;s timeless classic, Jim Kay&#8217;s glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.     </p>
<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>
