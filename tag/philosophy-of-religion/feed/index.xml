<p>                    From the author of Man is Not Alone and God in Search of Man, comes Abraham Heschel&#8217;s 1962 masterpiece of Biblical scholarship, The Prophets.    </p>
<p>                    The classic work on the Old Testament prophets by a major twentieth-century scholar    </p>
<p>                     The Prophets provides a unique opportunity for readers of the Old Testament, both Christian and Jewish, to gain fresh and deep knowledge of Israel&#8217;s prophetic movement. The author&#8217;s profound understanding of the prophets also opens the door to new insight into the philosophy of religion.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important philosophy titles published in the twentieth century, Josef Pieper&#8217;s Leisure, the Basis of Culture is more significant, even more crucial, today than it was when it first appeared more than fifty years ago. This edition also includes his work The Philosophical Act. Leisure is an attitude of the mind and a condition of the soul that fosters a capacity to perceive the reality of the world. Pieper shows that the Greeks and medieval Europeans, understood the great value and importance of leisure. He also points out that religion can be born only in leisure &#8212; a leisure that allows time for the contemplation of the nature of God. Leisure has been, and always will be, the first foundation of any culture. Pieper maintains that our bourgeois world of total labor has vanquished leisure, and issues a startling warning: Unless we regain the art of silence and insight, the ability for non-activity, unless we substitute true leisure for our hectic amusements, we will destroy our culture &#8212; and ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Name of God is Mercy, Pope Francis&#8217; exploration on the universal theme of mercy, is a spiritual inspiration to both followers of Christianity and non-Christians around the world.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own experience as a priest and shepherd, Pope Francis discusses mercy, a subject of central importance in his religious teaching and testimony, and in addition sums up other ideas &#8211; reconciliation, the closeness of God &#8211; that comprise the heart of his papacy. Written in conversation with Vatican expert and La Stampa journalist Andrea Tornielli, The Name of God is Mercy is directed at everyone, inside or outside of the Catholic Church, seeking meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, or the healing of physical or spiritual wounds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The national bestseller, now available in a non-illustrated, standard format paperback edition    </p>
<p>                    The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work. A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people&#8211;including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the &#8220;song of the universe, the music of the spheres.&#8221; With Bill Moyers, one of America&#8217;s most prominent journalists, as his thoughtful and engaging interviewer, The Power of Myth touches on subjects from modern marriage to virgin births, from Jesus to John Lennon, offering a brilliant combination of intelligence and wit.     </p>
<p>                    This extraordinary book reveals how the themes and symbols of ancient narratives continue to bring meaning to birth, death, love, and war. From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell&#8217;s work, The Power of Myth continues to exert a profound influence on our culture.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested.&#8217; DESMOND TUTU    </p>
<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shashi Tharoor offers a profound re-examination of Hinduism, one of the world&#8217;s oldest and greatest religious traditions.    </p>
<p>                    Opening with a frank and touching reflection on his personal beliefs, he lays out Hinduism&#8217;s origins and its key philosophical concepts &#8211; including Vedanta, the Purusharthas, and Bhakti &#8211; before focusing on texts such as the Bhagadvagita. The &#8216;Great Souls&#8217;, or key individuals of Hinduism, from Adi Shankara to Vivekananda, are discussed, as are everyday Hindu beliefs and practices, from worship to pilgrimage to caste.    </p>
<p>                    Tharoor is unsparing in his criticism of extremism and unequivocal in his belief that what makes India a distinctive nation with a unique culture will be imperilled if Hindu &#8216;fundamentalists&#8217;, the proponents of &#8216;Hindutva&#8217;, or politicised Hinduism, seize the high ground. In his view, it is precisely because Hindus form the majority that India has survived as a plural, secular democracy.    </p>
<p>                    A book that will be read and debated now and in the future, Why I Am a Hindu, written in Tharoor&#8217;s captivating prose, is a revelatory and original contribution to our understanding of religion in the modern era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the crossroads of psychology and religion, this catalyzing work applied the scientific method to a field abounding in abstract theory. William James believed that individual religious experiences, rather than the precepts of organized religions, were the backbone of the world&#8217;s religious life. His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences &#8211; all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E. Marty discusses how James&#8217;s pluralistic view of religion led to his remarkable tolerance of extreme forms of religious behaviour, his challenging, highly original theories, and his welcome lack of pretension in all of his observations on the individual and the divine.</p>
