<p>                    &#8220;Just as I Am is my truth. It is me, plain and unvarnished, with the glitter and garland set aside. In these pages, I am indeed Cicely, the actress who has been blessed to grace the stage and screen for six decades. Yet I am also the church girl who once rarely spoke a word. I am the teenager who sought solace in the verses of the old hymn for which this book is named. I am a daughter and a mother, a sister and a friend. I am an observer of human nature and the dreamer of audacious dreams. I am a woman who has hurt as immeasurably as I have loved, a child of God divinely guided by his hand. And here in my ninth decade, I am a woman who, at long last, has something meaningful to say.&#8221; -Cicely Tyson    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From one of China&#8217;s most acclaimed and decorated writers comes a powerful first-person account of life in Wuhan during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>                    On January 25, 2020, after the central government imposed a lockdown in Wuhan, acclaimed Chinese writer Fang Fang began publishing an online diary. In the days and weeks that followed, Fang Fang&#8217;s nightly postings gave voice to the fears, frustrations, anger, and hope of millions of her fellow citizens, reflecting on the psychological impact of forced isolation, the role of the internet as both community lifeline and source of misinformation, and most tragically, the lives of neighbors and friends taken by the deadly virus. </p>
<p>                    A fascinating eyewitness account of events as they unfold, Wuhan Diary captures the challenges of daily life and the changing moods and emotions of being quarantined without reliable information. Fang Fang finds solace in small domestic comforts and is inspired by the courage of friends, health professionals and volunteers, as well as the resilience and perseverance of Wuhan&#8217;s nine million residents. But, by claiming the writerÂ´s duty to record she also speaks out against social injustice, abuse of power, and other problems which impeded the response to the epidemic and gets herself embroiled in online controversies because of it.</p>
<p>                    As Fang Fang documents the beginning of the global health crisis in real time, we are able to identify patterns and mistakes that many of the countries dealing with the novel coronavirus have later repeated. She reminds us that, in the face of the new virus, the plight of the citizens of Wuhan is also that of citizens everywhere. As Fang Fang writes: &#8220;The virus is the common enemy of humankind; that is a lesson for all humanity. The only way we can conquer this virus and free ourselves from its grip is for all members of humankind to work together.&#8221; </p>
<p>                    Blending the intimate and the epic, the profound and the quotidian, Wuhan Diary is a remarkable record of an extraordinary time. </p>
<p>                    Translated from the Chinese by Michael Berry</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This explosive new book challenges many of the long-prevailing assumptions about blacks, about Jews, about Germans, about slavery, and about education. Plainly written, powerfully reasoned, and backed with a startling array of documented facts, Black Rednecks and White Liberals takes on not only the trendy intellectuals of our times but also such historic interpreters of American life as Alexis de Tocqueville and Frederick Law Olmsted. In a series of long essays, this book presents an in-depth look at key beliefs behind many mistaken and dangerous actions, policies, and trends. It presents eye-opening insights into the historical development of the ghetto culture that is today wrongly seen as a unique black identity&#8211;a culture cheered on toward self-destruction by white liberals who consider themselves &#8220;friends&#8221; of blacks. An essay titled &#8220;The Real History of Slavery&#8221; presents a jolting re-examination of that tragic institution and the narrow and distorted way it is too often seen today. The reasons for the venomous hatred of Jews, and of other groups like them in countries around the world, are explored in an essay that asks, &#8220;Are Jews Generic?&#8221;<br />
                    Misconceptions of German history in general, and of the Nazi era in particular, are also re-examined. So too are the inspiring achievements and painful tragedies of black education in the United States. &#8220;Black Rednecks and White Liberals&#8221; is the capstone of decades of outstanding research and writing on racial and cultural issues by Thomas Sowell.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although Daniel Everett was a missionary, far from converting the Pirahas, they converted him. He shows the slow, meticulous steps by which he gradually mastered their language and his gradual realisation that its unusual nature closely reflected its speakers&#8217; startlingly original perceptions of the world.    </p>
<p>                    Everett describes how he began to realise that his discoveries about the Piraha language opened up a new way of understanding how language works in our minds and in our lives, and that this way was utterly at odds with Noam Chomsky&#8217;s universally accepted linguistic theories. The perils of passionate academic opposition were then swiftly conjoined to those of the Amazon in a debate whose outcome has yet to be won. Everett&#8217;s views are most recently discussed in Tom Wolfe&#8217;s bestselling The Kingdom of Speech.    </p>
<p>                    Adventure, personal enlightenment and the makings of a scientific revolution proceed together in this vivid, funny and moving book.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The seminal work that has redefined our  understanding of colonialism and empire, with a preface by the author    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Stimulating, elegant and pugnacious&#8217; Observer<br />
                    &#8216;Magisterial&#8217; Terry Eagleton    </p>
<p>                    In this  highly-acclaimed work, Edward Said surveys the history and nature of  Western attitudes towards the East, considering orientalism as a  powerful European ideological creation &#8211; a way for writers, philosophers  and colonial administrators to deal with the &#8216;otherness&#8217; of eastern  culture, customs and beliefs. He traces this view through the writings  of Homer, Nerval and Flaubert, Disraeli and Kipling, whose imaginative  depictions have greatly contributed to the West&#8217;s romantic and exotic  picture of the Orient. Drawing on his own experiences as an Arab  Palestinian living in the West, Said examines how these ideas can be a  reflection of European imperialism and racism.<br />
                    &#8216;Beautifully patterned and passionately argued&#8217;<br />
                    New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Very exciting &#8230; his case is not merely persuasive, but conclusive&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;With clarity and compassion,  DiAngelo allows us to understand racism as  a practice not restricted to  &#8220;bad people.&#8221; In doing so, she moves our  national discussions forward.  This is a necessary book for all people  invested in societal change&#8217;  Claudia Rankine    </p>
<p>                    Anger. Fear. Guilt. Denial. Silence. These  are the ways in which  ordinary white people react when it is pointed  out to them that they  have done or said something that has &#8211;  unintentionally &#8211; caused racial  offence or hurt. After, all, a racist  is the worst thing a person can  be, right? But these reactions only  serve to silence people of colour,  who cannot give honest feedback to  &#8216;liberal&#8217; white people lest they  provoke a dangerous emotional  reaction.     </p>
<p>                    Robin DiAngelo coined  the term &#8216;White Fragility&#8217; in  2011 to describe this process and is here  to show us how it serves to  uphold the system of white supremacy. Using  knowledge and insight  gained over decades of running racial awareness  workshops and working  on this idea as a Professor of Whiteness Studies,  she shows us how we  can start having more honest conversations, listen  to each other better  and react to feedback with grace and humility. It  is not enough to  simply hold abstract progressive views and condemn the  obvious racists  on social media &#8211; change starts with us all at a  practical, granular  level, and it is time for all white people to take  responsibility for  relinquishing their own racial supremacy.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;By turns mordant  and  then inspirational, an argument that powerful  forces and tragic   histories stack the deck fully against racial justice  alongside one  that  we need only to be clearer, try harder, and do  better&#8217; David  Roediger, Los Angeles Review of Books    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The value in White Fragility    lies in its methodical, irrefutable exposure of racism in thought and    action, and its call for humility and vigilance&#8217; Katy Waldman, New Yorker    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times Notable Book of 2016<br />
                    Winner of the ZÃ³calo Public Square Book Prize     </p>
<p>                    On March 29, 1516, the city council of Venice issued a decree forcing Jews to live in il geto&#8211;a closed quarter named for the copper foundry that once occupied the area. The term stuck.     </p>
<p>                    In this sweeping and original account, Mitchell Duneier traces the idea of the ghetto from its beginnings in the sixteenth century and its revival by the Nazis to the present. As Duneier shows, we cannot comprehend the entanglements of race, poverty, and place in America today without recalling the ghettos of Europe, as well as earlier efforts to understand the problems of the American city.     </p>
<p>                    Ghetto is the story of the scholars and activists who tried to achieve that understanding. As Duneier shows, their efforts to wrestle with race and poverty cannot be divorced from their individual biographies, which often included direct encounters with prejudice and discrimination in the academy and elsewhere. Using new and forgotten sources, Duneier introduces us to Horace Cayton and St. Clair Drake, graduate students whose conception of the South Side of Chicago established a new paradigm for thinking about Northern racism and poverty in the 1940s. We learn how the psychologist Kenneth Clark subsequently linked Harlem&#8217;s slum conditions with the persistence of black powerlessness, and we follow the controversy over Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#8217;s report on the black family. We see how the sociologist William Julius Wilson redefined the debate about urban America as middle-class African Americans increasingly escaped the ghetto and the country retreated from racially specific remedies. And we trace the education reformer Geoffrey Canada&#8217;s efforts to transform the lives of inner-city children with ambitious interventions, even as other reformers sought to help families escape their neighborhoods altogether.     </p>
<p>                    Duneier offers a clear-eyed assessment of the thinkers and doers who have shaped American ideas about urban poverty&#8211;and the ghetto. The result is a valuable new estimation of an age-old concept.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>* Longlisted for the National Book Award * Winner of the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award * A New York Times Notable Book * A Washington Post Notable Book * An NPR Best Book of 2017 * A Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2017 * An Atlanta Journal-Constitution Best Southern Book of 2017 *    </p>
<p>                     This extraordinary New York Times bestseller reexamines a pivotal event of the civil rights movement-the 1955 lynching of Emmett Till-&#8220;and demands that we do the one vital thing we aren&#8217;t often enough asked to do with history: learn from it&#8221; (The Atlantic).    </p>
<p>                    In 1955, white men in the Mississippi Delta lynched a fourteen-year-old from Chicago named Emmett Till. His murder was part of a wave of white terrorism in the wake of the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared public school segregation unconstitutional. Only weeks later, Rosa Parks thought about young Emmett as she refused to move to the back of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Five years later, Black students who called themselves &#8220;the Emmett Till generation&#8221; launched sit-in campaigns that turned the struggle for civil rights into a mass movement. Till&#8217;s lynching became the most notorious hate crime in American history.    </p>
<p>                    But what actually happened to Emmett Till-not the icon of injustice, but the flesh-and-blood boy? Part detective story, part political history, The Blood of Emmett Till &#8220;unfolds like a movie&#8221; (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution), drawing on a wealth of new evidence, including a shocking admission of Till&#8217;s innocence from the woman in whose name he was killed. &#8220;Jolting and powerful&#8221; (The Washington Post), the book &#8220;provides fresh insight into the way race has informed and deformed our democratic institutions&#8221; (Diane McWhorter, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Carry Me Home) and &#8220;calls us to the cause of justice today&#8221; (Rev. Dr. William J. Barber, II, president of the North Carolina NAACP).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The greater freedom is to be who you actually are; to be able to live your life in the way you deem best, free from any sort of restriction to do that, or fear of repercussions for doing so.    </p>
<p>                    Egyptian-born and London-raised, Alya Mooro grew up between two cultures and felt a pull from both. Where could she turn for advice and inspiration when it seemed there was nobody else like her? Today, Mooro is determined to explore and explode the myth that she must identify either as &#8216;Western&#8217; or as one of almost 400 million other &#8216;Arabs&#8217; across the Middle East.    </p>
<p>                    Through countless interviews and meticulous research, as well as her own unique experience, Mooro gives voice to the Middle Eastern women who, like her, don&#8217;t fit the mould. Women under pressure to conform to society&#8217;s ideals of how a woman should look and behave, what she should want and be. Women who want to think and act and love freely, without feeling that every choice means &#8216;picking a side&#8217;. Women who are two things at once and, consequently, neither.    </p>
<p>                    Part memoir, part social exploration, this is a book for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;That certain groups do much better in America than others-as measured by income, occupational status, test scores, and so on-is difficult to talk about. In large part this is because the topic feels racially charged. The irony is that the facts actually debunk racial stereotypes. There are black and Hispanic subgroups in the United States far outperforming many white and Asian subgroups. Moreover, there&#8217;s a demonstrable arc to group success-in immigrant groups, it typically dissipates by the third generation-puncturing the notion of innate group differences and undermining the whole concept of &#8216;model minorities.'&#8221;    </p>
<p>                     Mormons have recently risen to astonishing business success. Cubans in Miami climbed from poverty to prosperity in a generation. Nigerians earn doctorates at stunningly high rates. Indian and Chinese Americans have much higher incomes than other Americans; Jews may have the highest of all.    </p>
<p>                     Why do some groups rise? Drawing on groundbreaking original research and startling statistics, The Triple Package uncovers the secret to their success. A superiority complex, insecurity, impulse control-these are the elements of the Triple Package, the rare and potent cultural constellation that drives disproportionate group success. The Triple Package is open to anyone. America itself was once a Triple Package culture. It&#8217;s been losing that edge for a long time now. Even as headlines proclaim the death of upward mobility in America, the truth is that the old-fashioned American Dream is very much alive-but some groups have a cultural edge, which enables them to take advantage of opportunity far more than others.    </p>
<p>                    *   Americans are taught that everyone is equal, that no group is superior to another. But remarkably, all of America&#8217;s most successful groups believe (even if they don&#8217;t say so aloud) that they&#8217;re exceptional, chosen, superior in some way.    </p>
<p>                    *   Americans are taught that self-esteem-feeling good about yourself-is the key to a successful life. But in all of America&#8217;s most successful groups, people tend to feel insecure, inadequate, that they have to prove themselves.    </p>
<p>                    *   America today spreads a message of immediate gratification, living for the moment. But all of America&#8217;s most successful groups cultivate heightened discipline and impulse control.    </p>
<p>                    But the Triple Package has a dark underside too. Each of its elements carries distinctive pathologies; when taken to an extreme, they can have truly toxic effects. Should people strive for the Triple Package? Should America? Ultimately, the authors conclude that the Triple Package is a ladder that should be climbed and then kicked away, drawing on its power but breaking free from its constraints.    </p>
<p>                     Provocative and profound, The Triple Package will transform the way we think about success and achievement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, spread, and deeply rooted in American society.     </p>
<p>                     Some Americans insist that we&#8217;re living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and well in America &#8212; it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.     </p>
<p>                     In this deeply researched and fast-moving narrative, Kendi chronicles the entire story of anti-black racist ideas and their staggering power over the course of American history. He uses the life stories of five major American intellectuals to drive this history: Puritan minister Cotton Mather, Thomas Jefferson, abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and legendary activist Angela Davis.     </p>
<p>                     As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies and the nation&#8217;s racial inequities.     </p>
<p>                     In shedding light on this history, Stamped from the Beginning offers us the tools we need to expose racist thinking. In the process, he gives us reason to hope.</p>
