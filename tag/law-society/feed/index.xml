										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Sunday Times number one bestseller.<br />
                    Winner of the Books are My Bag Non-Fiction Award.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Waterstones Book of the Year.<br />
                    Shortlisted for Specsavers Non-Fiction Book of the Year.</p>
<p>                    You may not wish to think about it, but one day you or someone you love will almost certainly appear in a criminal courtroom. You might be a juror, a victim, a witness or &#8211; perhaps through no fault of your own &#8211; a defendant. Whatever your role, you&#8217;d expect a fair trial.</p>
<p>                      I&#8217;m a barrister. I work in the criminal justice system, and every day I see how fairness is not guaranteed. Too often the system fails those it is meant to protect. The innocent are wronged and the guilty allowed to walk free.</p>
<p>                    In The Secret Barrister: Stories of the Law and How It&#8217;s Broken I want to share some stories from my daily life to show you how the system is broken, who broke it and why we should start caring before it&#8217;s too late.</p>
<p>                    A Sunday Times top ten bestseller for twenty-four weeks.<br />
                    &#8216;Eye-opening, funny and horrifying&#8217; &#8211; Observer<br />
                    &#8216;Everyone who has any interest in public life should read it&#8217; &#8211; Daily Mail</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times Bestseller    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Simply, utterly brilliant. Bursting with humility and humanity&#8217; The Secret Barrister    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An elegant, philosophical and, at times, moving memoir of what it is like to serve as America&#8217;s most high-profile legal official&#8217; Financial Times    </p>
<p>                    Multi-million-dollar fraud. Terrorism. Mafia criminality. Russian espionage.     </p>
<p>                    As United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara prosecuted some of the most high-profile cases in America. In Doing Justice he takes us inside America&#8217;s criminal justice system to deliver a powerful meditation on justice  &#8211; what it is, who dispenses it, how it works &#8211; and what the law can teach us about thinking and acting justly in our own lives.</p>
