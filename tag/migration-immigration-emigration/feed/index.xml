<p>                    You&#8217;re British.    </p>
<p>                    Your parents are British.    </p>

<p>                    We are a nation in denial about our imperial past and the racism that plagues our present. Brit(ish) is Afua Hirsch&#8217;s personal and provocative exploration of how this came to be &#8211; and an urgent call for change.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if the new far right poses a graver threat to liberal democracy than jihadists or mass migration?    </p>
<p>                    From Europe to the United States and beyond, opportunistic politicians have exploited economic crisis, terrorist attacks and an influx of refugees to bring hateful and reactionary views from the margins of political discourse into the corridors of power. This climate has already helped propel Donald Trump to the White House, pushed Britain out of the European Union, and put Marine Le Pen within striking distance of the French presidency.    </p>
<p>                    Sasha Polakow-Suransky&#8217;s on-the-ground reportage and interviews with the rising stars of the new right tell the story of how we got here, tracing the global rise of anti-immigration politics and the ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe&#8217;s new far right as defenders of Western liberal values.    </p>
<p>                    Go Back to Where You Came From is an indispensable account of why xenophobia went mainstream in countries known historically as defenders of human rights and models of tolerance.</p>

Part memoir, part communal storytelling, We Are Displaced introduces readers to some of the incredible girls Malala has met on her many journeys and lets each tell her story &#8211; girls who have lost their community, relatives and often the only world they&#8217;ve ever known, but have not lost hope.    </p>
<p>                    Longing for home and fear of an uncertain future binds all of these young women, but each is unique. In a time of immigration crises, war and border conflicts, We Are Displaced is an important reminder that every single one of the 79.5 million currently displaced is a person &#8211; often a young person &#8211; with dreams for a better, safer world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immigration divides our globalising world like no other issue. We are swamped by bogus asylum-seekers and infiltrated by terrorists, our jobs stolen, our benefit system abused, our way of life destroyed &#8211; or so we are told. Philippe Legrain, author of the critically acclaimed OPEN WORLD, has written the first book that looks beyond the headlines. Why are ever-rising numbers of people from poor countries arriving in Europe, North America and Australasia? Can we keep them out? Should we even be trying? Combining compelling first-hand reporting from around the world, incisive socio-economic analysis and a broad understanding of what is at stake politically and culturally, IMMIGRANTS is a passionate, but lucid book. In our open world, more people will inevitably move across borders, Legrain says &#8211; and we should generally welcome them. They do the jobs we can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t do &#8211; and their diversity enriches us all. Left and right; free-marketeers and campaigners for global justice; enlightened patriots &#8211; all should rally behind the cause of freer migration, because They need Us and We need Them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Frontier Justice is a gripping exploration of the world-wide refugee crisis. Andy Lamey presents the story behind the radical increase in the global number of asylum-seekers, set within the historical and philosophical context in which the ideas of asylum originated and evolved.    Importantly, Lamey approaches the issue as a global one, presenting case studies from Australia, North America, and Europe He follows the extraordinary efforts of a set of Yale law students who sued the U.S. government on behalf of a group of refugees imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay; he recounts one refugee family&#8217;s harrowing journey from Saddam Hussein&#8217;s Iraq to contemporary Australia via the world&#8217;s most dangerous ocean crossing; and he explores the fascinating case of Ahmed Ressam, the so-called Millennium bomber who filed a refugee claim in Canada before attempting to blow up the Los Angeles airport.   Throughout Lamey&#8217;s account, he focuses on the rights of people in search of asylum, and how those rights are routinely violated. But Frontier Justice does not merely point out problems. At the      heart of the book is a new blueprint for how the rights of refugees might be enforced, and a vision of human rights that is ultimately optimistic and deeply affirmative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times Notable Book     </p>
<p>                    Chinese immigrants of the recent past and unfolding twenty-first century are in search of the African dream. So explains indefatigable traveler Howard W. French, prize-winning investigative journalist and former New York Times bureau chief in Africa and China, in the definitive account of this seismic geopolitical development. China&#8217;s burgeoning presence in Africa is already shaping, and reshaping, the future of millions of people. From Liberia to Senegal to Mozambique, in creaky trucks and by back roads, French introduces us to the characters who make up China&#8217;s dogged emigrant population: entrepreneurs singlehandedly reshaping African infrastructure, and less-lucky migrants barely scraping by but still convinced of Africa&#8217;s opportunities. French&#8217;s acute observations offer illuminating insight into the most pressing unknowns of modern Sino-African relations: Why China is making these cultural and economic incursions into the continent; what Africa&#8217;s role is in this equation; and what the ramifications for both parties and their people&#8211;and the watching world&#8211;will be in the foreseeable future.     </p>
