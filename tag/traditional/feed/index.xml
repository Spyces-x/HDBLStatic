                    The second installment in Rick Riordan&#8217;s blockbuster Norse mythology series has Magnus and friends helping the god of thunder find his missing weapon before all Muspellheim breaks loose.<br />
                    Thor&#8217;s hammer is missing again. The thunder god has a disturbing habit of misplacing his weapon&#8211;the mightiest force in the Nine Worlds. But this time the hammer isn&#8217;t just lost, it has fallen into enemy hands.<br />
                    If Magnus Chase and his friends can&#8217;t retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn.<br />
                    Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer&#8217;s return is the gods&#8217; worst enemy, Loki&#8211;and the price he wants is very high.    </p>

                    A can&#8217;t-live-without guide for guests of the Hotel Valhalla, this volume contains facts about the Norse gods as well as other characters and creatures you might encounter if you are fortunate enough to be chosen as one of Odin&#8217;s brave warriors.<br />
                    So you&#8217;ve made it to Valhalla. Now what?This &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; guide to the gods, goddesses, and other important figures of Norse mythology was commissioned by Helgi, who, after more than a millennium as manager of Hotel Valhalla, became fed up with answering the same questions from newly deceased heroes at check-in.<br />
                    The profiles provide essential stats, interviews, and personal reflections so you can identify the gods and avoid those awkward introductions. Handy facts about other beings round out this go-to tome. You&#8217;ll never see Ratatosk as a cute little rodent or confuse a dwarf with an elf ever again!    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life preservers are mandatory for this wet, wild, and wondrous adventure, the third entry in Rick Riordan&#8217;s New York Times #1 best-selling Norse mythology trilogy, which features a cameo from Percy Jackson.<br />
                    Magnus Chase, a once-homeless teen, is a resident of the Hotel Valhalla and one of Odin&#8217;s chosen warriors. As the son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus isn&#8217;t naturally inclined to fighting. But he has strong and steadfast friends, including Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, and Samirah the Valkyrie, and together they have achieved brave deeds, such as defeating Fenris Wolf and battling giants for Thor&#8217;s hammer, Mjolnir. Now Magnus faces his most dangerous trial yet. His cousin, Annabeth, recruits her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, to give Magnus some pointers, but will his training be enough?<br />
                    Loki is free from his chains. He&#8217;s readying Naglfar, the Ship of the Dead, complete with a host of giants and zombies, to sail against the Asgardian gods and begin the final battle of Ragnarok. It&#8217;s up to Magnus and his friends to stop him, but to do so they will have to sail across the oceans of Midgard, Jotunheim, and Niflheim in a desperate race to reach Naglfar before it&#8217;s ready to sail.<br />
                    Along the way, they will face angry sea gods, hostile giants, and an evil fire-breathing dragon. Magnus&#8217;s biggest challenge will be facing his own inner demons. Does he have what it takes to outwit the wily trickster god?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to an awful camp orientation video created by the god Apollo, Percy Jackson and other residents of Camp Half-Blood answer such questions as What is this place? and Do I get to keep the T-shirt? Newbies can check out the section on the Divine Cabins, read up on Magical Landmarks, and consult the chapter of Training Arenas.<br />
                    But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there. For instance, campers do not always co-exist in peace and harmony. The camp is not run with superior efficiency. Prophecies do not flow forth with great regularity.<br />
                    Sprinkled throughout are stories from heroes who have called Camp Half-Blood home or just passed through on their way to places unknown. Chiron himself introduces the book with a brief history of training based on his millennia of experience. And, of course, there are divine words of wisdom from the god Apollo himself, because . . . well, because the demigod authors would prefer not to be struck down, thank you very much.    </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    I look like a normal kid. Only there&#8217;s a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me. </p>
<p>                    Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball. </p>
<p>                    This time, we&#8217;re under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we&#8217;ll be invaded by monsters. Big ones. </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />
                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    Normally when you turn sixteen you get a really cool present. </p>
<p>                    But, being sixteen and the son of Poseidon can never be that simple. So instead, I get a prophecy that says the fate of the entire world on my shoulders. Great. </p>
<p>                    On top of that, Kronos, Lord of the Titans, is attacking New York City and the dreaded monster Typhon is heading our way. So, it&#8217;s me and forty of my demi-god friends versus untold evil.</p>
<p>                    Happy birthday to me! </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />
                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>

Perfect for fans of the Court of Thorns and Roses series and the Wrath and the Dawn duology, The Traitor Prince is a thrilling new standalone novel in the Ravenspire series.    </p>
<p>                    Javan Najafai, crown prince of Akram, has spent the last ten years at an elite boarding school, far away from his kingdom. But his eagerly awaited return home is cut short when a mysterious impostor takes his place&#8211;and no one believes Javan is the true prince.    </p>
<p>                    After barely escaping the impostor&#8217;s assassins, Javan is thrown into Maqbara, the kingdom&#8217;s most dangerous prison. The only way to gain an audience with the king&#8211;and reveal Javan&#8217;s identity&#8211;is to fight in Maqbara&#8217;s yearly tournament. But winning is much harder than acing competitions at school, and soon Javan finds himself beset not just by the terrifying creatures in the arena but also by a band of prisoners allied against him, and even by the warden herself.    </p>
<p>                    The only person who can help him is Sajda, who has been enslaved by Maqbara&#8217;s warden since she was a child, and whose guarded demeanor and powerful right hook keep the prisoners in check. Working with Sajda might be the only way Javan can escape alive&#8211;but she has dangerous secrets.    </p>
<p>                    Together, Javan and Sajda have to outwit the vicious warden, outfight deadly creatures, and outlast the murderous prisoners intent on killing Javan. If they fail, they&#8217;ll be trapped in Maqbara for good&#8211;and the secret Sajda&#8217;s been hiding will bury them both.</p>

<p>                    He was once an immortal God. Now, he&#8217;s a teenage boy called Lester.     </p>
<p>                    Apollo has angered his father Zeus for the last time.     </p>
<p>                    So, how do you punish an immortal?    </p>
<p>                    By making him human. Obviously.     </p>
<p>                    Cast down from Olympus, he&#8217;s weak, disorientated and stuck in New York City as a teenage boy.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s the first time he&#8217;s been without his powers, and he has to survive in the modern world.    </p>
<p>                    Which isn&#8217;t an easy feat for a four-thousand-year old deity, especially one with as many enemies as he has.     </p>
<p>                    Apollo needs help, and he can only think of one place to go . . . an enclave of modern demigods known as Camp Half-Blood.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestselling dark epic fantasy inspired by the tale of Snow White, from C. J. Redwine, the author of the Defiance series. This breathtakingly romantic, action-packed fantasy is perfect for fans of A Court of Thorns and Roses and Cinder.     </p>
<p>                    Lorelai Diederich, crown princess and fugitive at large, has one mission: kill the wicked queen who took both the Ravenspire throne and the life of her father. To do that, Lorelai needs to use the one weapon she and Queen Irina have in common&#8211;magic. She&#8217;ll have to be stronger, faster, and more powerful than Irina, the most dangerous sorceress Ravenspire has ever seen.    </p>
<p>                    In the neighboring kingdom of Eldr, when Prince Kol&#8217;s father and older brother are killed by an invading army of magic-wielding ogres, the second-born prince is suddenly given the responsibility of saving his kingdom. To do that, Kol needs magic of his own&#8211;and the only way to get it is to make a deal with the queen of Ravenspire, promise to become her personal huntsman&#8211;and bring her Lorelai&#8217;s heart.    </p>
<p>                    But Lorelai is nothing like Kol expected&#8211;beautiful, fierce, and unstoppable&#8211;and despite dark magic, Lorelai is drawn in by the passionate and troubled king. Fighting to stay one step ahead of the dragon huntsman&#8211;who she likes far more than she should&#8211;Lorelai does everything in her power to ruin the wicked queen. But Irina isn&#8217;t going down without a fight, and her final move may cost the princess the one thing she still has left to lose.</p>

<p>                    There&#8217;s only one way he can earn back Zeus&#8217; favour, and that&#8217;s to seek and restore the ancient oracles &#8211; but that&#8217;s easier said than done. </p>
<p>                    Apollo must head to the American Midwest where, rumour has it, a haunted cave may hold answers. </p>
<p>                    There are a few things standing in his way though. The cave could kill him, or drive him insane. </p>
<p>                    Oh, and a Roman Emperor, whose love of bloodshed makes Nero look tame.</p>
<p>                    To stay alive, Apollo needs the help of a mortal goddess, a bronze dragon, and some familiar faces from Camp Half-Blood. </p>
<p>                    Will he survive the greatest challenge of his four thousand year existence?<br />
