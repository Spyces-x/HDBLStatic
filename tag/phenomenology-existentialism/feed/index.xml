<p>                    Paris, near the turn of 1932-3. Three young friends meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse. They are Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and their friend Raymond Aron, who opens their eyes to a radical new way of thinking&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s not often that you miss your bus stop because you&#8217;re so engrossed in reading a book about existentialism, but I did exactly that&#8230; The story of Sartre, Beauvoir, Camus, Heidegger et al is strange, fun and compelling reading. If it doesn&#8217;t win awards, I will eat my copy&#8217; Independent on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Bakewell shows how fascinating were some of the existentialists&#8217; ideas and how fascinating, often frightful, were their lives. Vivid, humorous anecdotes are interwoven with a lucid and unpatronising exposition of their complex philosophy&#8230; Tender, incisive and fair&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Quirky, funny, clear and passionate&#8230; Few writers are as good as Bakewell at explaining complicated ideas in a way that makes them easy to understand&#8217; Mail on Sunday</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billions of dollars were hastily poured into the global banking system in a frantic attempt at financial stabilisation. So why has it not been possible to bring the same forces to bear in addressing world poverty and environmental crisis? In this take-no-prisoners analysis, Slavoj Zizek frames the moral failures of the modern world in terms of the epoch-making events of the first decade of this century. What he finds is the old one-two punch of history: the jab of tragedy, the right hook of farce. In the attacks of 9/11 and the global credit crunch, liberalism dies twice: as a political doctrine and as an economic theory. The election of Donald Trump only confirms the bankruptcy of a liberal order on its last legs. First as Tragedy, Then as Farce is a call for the left to reinvent itself in the light of our desperate historical situation. The time for liberal, moralistic blackmail is over.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Divided Self, R.D. Laing&#8217;s groundbreaking exploration of the nature of madness, illuminated the nature of mental illness and made the mysteries of the mind comprehensible to a wide audience.     </p>
<p>                    First published in 1960, this watershed work aimed to make madness comprehensible, and in doing so revolutionized the way we perceive mental illness. Using case studies of patients he had worked with, psychiatrist R. D. Laing argued that psychosis is not a medical condition, but an outcome of the &#8216;divided self&#8217;, or the tension between the two personas within us: one our authentic, private identity, and the other the false, &#8216;sane&#8217; self that we present to the world.     </p>
<p>                    Laing&#8217;s radical approach to insanity offered a rich existential analysis of personal alienation and made him a cult figure in the 1960s, yet his work was most significant for its humane attitude, which put the patient back at the centre of treatment.    </p>
<p>                    Includes an introduction by Professor Anthony S. David.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;One of the twentieth century&#8217;s most influential psychotherapists&#8217;<br />
                    Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Laing challenged the psychiatric orthodoxy of his time &#8230; an icon of the 1960s counter-culture&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Throughout history, some books have changed the world. They have transformed the way we see ourselves &#8211; and each other. They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives &#8211; and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are. Inspired by the myth of a man condemned to ceaselessly push a rock up a mountain and watch it roll back to the valley below, The Myth of Sisyphus transformed twentieth-century philosophy with its impassioned argument for the value of life in a world without religious meaning.</p>
