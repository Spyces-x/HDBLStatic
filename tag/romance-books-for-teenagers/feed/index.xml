										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From USA TODAY Bestselling Author, C. L. Stone, read Black and Green, the much-anticipated eleventh book in The Academy Ghost Bird Series.</p>
<p>                    Sang Sorenson&#8217;s father abandoned her and her sister, leaving them to fend for themselves for months. He&#8217;s returned, and finds Sang is missing. He demands she return. Right now.</p>
<p>                    Will he call the police if she doesn&#8217;t?</p>
<p>                    Her Academy team doesn&#8217;t want to risk losing her ghost status and she doesn&#8217;t want to put them in danger, so she reluctantly returns home, but is comforted that she will still be monitored by them.</p>
<p>                    But the second she opens the door, she discovers her father has made changes that will affect her entire future. His decisions will make them a normal family.</p>
<p>                    Normal is no longer what Sang wants. It would kill her Academy career before it ever started. Not to mention it would end the special, new, and still-fragile relationships with the guys.</p>
<p>                    Sang struggles with her family, her identity, and where she truly belongs. Now that the entire team knows about their romantic relationships with her, tensions are mounting, tearing the team apart from the inside.</p>
<p>                    Only, Dr. Green isn&#8217;t going to lie down and roll over by playing by the rules. Not anymore. Not while Sang is at risk.</p>
<p>                    His heart can&#8217;t take leaving her in that house one more minute. He needs her. They all do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An irreverent and irresistible New York Times bestselling romance between the so-called Designated Ugly Fat Friend and the Hot Jock.      </p>
<p>                    Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper may not be the prettiest girl in her high school, but she has a loyal group of friends, a biting wit, and a spot-on BS detector. She&#8217;s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush, who calls Bianca the Duff&#8211;the Designated Ugly Fat Friend&#8211;of her crew.     </p>
<p>                    But things aren&#8217;t so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him.     </p>
<p>                    Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn&#8217;t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she&#8217;s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These Royals will ruin you&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself.    </p>
<p>                    Reed Royal has it all-looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.    </p>
<p>                    What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father&#8217;s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely-keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed&#8217;s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed&#8217;s entire world begins to fall apart around him.    </p>
<p>                    Ella doesn&#8217;t want him anymore. She says they&#8217;ll only destroy each other.    </p>
<p>                    She might be right.    </p>
<p>                    Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It&#8217;s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he&#8217;s going to win back his princess, he&#8217;ll need to prove himself Royally worthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gorgeously written and oh-so-deeply felt &#8211; Nicola Yoon, author of Everything Everything and The Sun is Also a Star    </p>
<p>                    From the author of the New York Times bestseller All the Bright Places comes a heart-wrenching story about what it means to see (and love) someone for who they truly are.    </p>
<p>                     Everyone thinks they know Libby Strout.<br />
                    I know the part I want to play here at MVB High. I want to be the girl who can do anything.    </p>
<p>                    Once dubed &#8216;America&#8217;s Fattest Teen&#8217;, she is only seen for her weight. Not the girl underneath.    </p>
<p>                    Since her mum&#8217;s death she&#8217;s been picking up the pieces in private, alone with her heartbroken father.    </p>
<p>                    But now, Libby is ready. She&#8217;s ready for high school, for new friends, for love and for every possibility life has to offer.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone thinks they know Jack Masselin too.<br />
                    Be charming. Be hilarious. Don&#8217;t get too close to anyone.    </p>
<p>                    Yes, he&#8217;s got swagger, but he&#8217;s also mastered the art of fitting in.    </p>
<p>                    What no one knows is that Jack has a secret: he can&#8217;t recognize faces. Even his own brothers are strangers to him.    </p>
<p>                    He&#8217;s the guy who can re-engineer and rebuild anything, but he can&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on with the inner workings of his own brain.     </p>
<p>                     When Jack and Libby meet, they discover that the more time they spend together, the less alone they feel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Reminded me not just what it&#8217;s like to be young and in love, but what it&#8217;s like to be young and in love with a book&#8217; John Green, author of The Fault in our Stars    </p>
<p>                    Eleanor is the new girl in town, and she&#8217;s never felt more alone. All mismatched clothes, mad red hair and chaotic home life, she couldn&#8217;t stick out more if she tried.    </p>
<p>                    Then she takes the seat on the bus next to Park. Quiet, careful and &#8211; in Eleanor&#8217;s eyes &#8211; impossibly cool, Park&#8217;s worked out that flying under the radar is the best way to get by.     </p>
<p>                    Slowly, steadily, through late-night conversations and an ever-growing stack of mix tapes, Eleanor and Park fall in love. They fall in love the way you do the first time, when you&#8217;re 16, and you have nothing and everything to lose.    </p>
<p>                    Set over the course of one school year in 1986, Eleanor &#038; Park is funny, sad, shocking and true &#8211; an exquisite nostalgia trip for anyone who has never forgotten their first love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times, USA Today, and internationally bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout returns to the world of the Lux with The Burning Shadow, the steamy, shocking second installment of the Origin series that will leave readers reeling.</p>
<p>When Evelyn Dasher crossed paths with Luc, she was thrown headfirst into the world of the Lux&#8211;only to discover that she was already far more involved in their world than she ever suspected.</p>
<p>Because the Luxen aren&#8217;t the only ones with a hidden past. There&#8217;s a gap in Evie&#8217;s memory, lost months of her life and a lingering sense that something happened, something she can&#8217;t remember and nobody is willing to tell her. She needs to find out the truth about who she is&#8211;and who she was. But every answer she finds only brings up more questions.</p>
<p>Her search for the truth brings her ever closer to Luc, the Origin at the center of it all. He&#8217;s powerful, arrogant, inhumanly beautiful, extremely dangerous&#8230;and possibly in love with her. But even as Evie falls for him, she can&#8217;t help but wonder if his attraction is to her, or to the memory of a girl who no longer exists.</p>
<p>And all the while, a new threat looms: reports of a flu-like, fatal virus that the government insists is being spread by Luxen. A horrifying illness that changes whoever it touches, spreading panic across a country already at its breaking point.</p>
