<p>                    Immensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King&#8217;s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.</p>
<p>                     Part memoir, part masterclass by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer&#8217;s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. </p>
<p>                    King&#8217;s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999 &#8211; and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it &#8211; fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A magnificent volume of short novels and an essential World War II report from one of America&#8217;s great twentieth-century writers </p>
<p>                    A Penguin Classic </p>
<p>                    On the heels of the enormous success of his masterwork The Grapes of Wrath and at the height of the American war effort John Steinbeck, one of the most prolific and influential literary figures of his generation, wrote Bombs Away, a nonfiction account of his experiences with U.S. Army Air Force bomber crews during World War II. Now, for the first time since its original publication in 1942, Penguin Classics presents this exclusive edition of Steinbeck&#8217;s introduction to the then-nascent U.S. Army Air Force and its bomber crew&#8211;the essential core unit behind American air power that Steinbeck described as the greatest team in the world. </p>
<p>                    For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fun and informative compendium for Stephen King fans-interviews, essays, and loads of facts and details about all of his work.</p>
<p>                    Fascinating facts, trivia, and little-known details about the Master of the Macabre&#8217;s life and work, plus interviews, essays, and insights for King fans, from the casual to the fanatical!</p>
<p>                    Did you know&#8230;?</p>
<p>                    In his early teens, Stephen King sold typed copies of his short stories at school.<br />
                    King originally thought his novel Pet Sematary was too frightening to publish.<br />
                    King&#8217;s legendary Dark Tower series took him more than 30 years to write.<br />
                    Thinner was the novel that revealed his &#8220;Richard Bachman&#8221; pseudonym to the world.<br />
                    King wrote The Eyes of the Dragon for his daughter Naomi.<br />
                    He has never liked Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s film version of his novel The Shining.<br />
                    It took him four years to write what some consider his magnum opus, IT.<br />
                    The 2017 film version of IT has grossed more than $700 million worldwide.<br />
                    In addition to novels, King has written essays, plays, screenplays, and even poetry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive history of the flamboyant life of Ian Fleming and his most famous creation, James Bond.    </p>
<p>                    This new biography of Ian Fleming presents a fresh and illuminating portrayal of the iconic creator of James Bond. Oliver Buckton provides the first in-depth exploration of the entire process of Ian Fleming&#8217;s writing-from initial conception, through composition, to his involvement in the innovative publication methods of his books. He also investigates the vital impact of Fleming&#8217;s work in naval intelligence during World War Two on his later writings, especially the wartime operations he planned and executed and how they drove the plots of the James Bond novels. Buckton considers the vital role of wartime deception, disinformation, and propaganda in shaping Fleming&#8217;s later techniques and imaginative creations. Offering a radically new view of Fleming&#8217;s relationships with women, Buckton traces the role of strong, independent, and intelligent women such as Maud Russell, Phyllis Bottome, and his wife, Ann, on Fleming&#8217;s portrayal of female characters. The book concludes with a thorough analysis of the James Bond films from Eon productions, and their influence in promoting, while also distorting, the public&#8217;s recognition of Fleming&#8217;s writing.    </p>

Is Emily Dickinson &#8220;the female Sade&#8221;? Is Donatello&#8217;s David a bit of pedophile pornography? What is the secret kinship between Byron and Elvis Presley, between Medusa and Madonna? How do liberals and feminists&#8211;as well as conservatives&#8211;fatally misread human nature? This audacious and omnivorously learned work of guerrilla scholarship offers nothing less than a unified-field theory of Western culture, high and low, since Egyptians invented beauty&#8211;making a persuasive case for all art as a pagan battleground between male and female, form and chaos, civilization and daemonic nature.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&#8217; The prophetic words of Galadriel, addressed to Frodo as he prepared to travel from Lothlorien to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, are just as pertinent to J R R Tolkien&#8217;s own fiction. For decades, hobbits and the other fantastical creatures of Middle-earth have captured the imaginations of a fiercely loyal tribe of readers, all enhanced by the immense success of Peter Jackson&#8217;s films: first &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;, and now his new &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;. But for all Tolkien&#8217;s global fame and the familiarity of modern culture with Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Sam, the sources of the great mythmaker&#8217;s own myth-making have been neglected. Mark Atherton here explores the chief influences on Tolkien&#8217;s work: his boyhood in the West Midlands; the landscapes and seascapes which shaped his mythologies; his experiences in World War I; his interest in Scandinavian myth; his friendships, especially with the other Oxford-based Inklings; and the relevance of his themes, especially ecological themes, to the present-day.<br />
                    &#8220;There and Back Again&#8221; offers a unique guide to the varied inspirations behind Tolkien&#8217;s life and work, and sheds new light on how a legend is born.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this delightful and original book, Jonathan Gottschall offers the first unified theory of storytelling. Drawing on neuroscience and evolutionary biology, The Storytelling Animal explores what stories reveal about human nature, how we process information, and think about the world.<br />
                    Humans live in landscapes of make-believe. We spin fantasies. We devour novels, films, and plays. Even sporting events and criminal trials unfold as narratives. Gottschall argues that stories help us navigate life&#8217;s complex social problems &#8212; just as flight simulators prepare pilots for difficult situations. Storytelling has evolved, like other behaviors, to ensure our survival. Gottschall tells us what it means to be a storytelling animal and explains how stories can change the world for the better.<br />
                    We know we are master shapers of story. The Storytelling Animal finally reveals how stories shape us.<br />

<p>                                &#8216;If you want to write a novel or a script, read this book&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;The best book on the craft of storytelling I&#8217;ve ever read&#8217; Matt Haig    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;Rarely has a book engrossed me more, and forced me to question everything I&#8217;ve ever read, seen or written. A masterpiece&#8217; Adam Rutherford    </p>
<p>                                Why stories make us human and how to tell them better.    </p>
<p>                              There have been many attempts to understand what makes a good story &#8211; but few have used a scientific approach.    </p>

<p>                              Applying dazzling psychological research and cutting-edge neuroscience to the foundations of our myths and archetypes, he shows how we can use these tools to tell better stories &#8211; and make sense of our chaotic modern world.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hilarious and indispensable guide to the weirdness of the workplace from Esquire editor and Entrepreneur etiquette columnist Ross McCammon    </p>
<p>                     Ten years ago, Ross McCammon made an incredible and unexpected transition from working at an in-flight magazine in suburban Dallas to landing his dream job at Esquire in New York. What followed was a period of almost debilitating anxiety and awkwardness&#8211;interspersed with minor instances of professional glory&#8211;as McCammon learned how to navigate the workplace while feeling entirely ill-equipped for achieving success in his new career.  Works Well with Others is McCammon&#8217;s &#8220;relentlessly funny and soberingly insightful&#8221;* journey from impostor to authority, a story that reveals the workplace for what it is: an often absurd landscape of ego and fear guided by social rules that no one ever talks about. By mining his own experiences at the magazine, McCammon provides advice on everything from firm handshakes to small talk in elevators to dealing with jerks and underminers. Here is an inspirational new way of looking at your job, your career, and success itself; an accessible guide for those of us who are smart, talented, and ambitious but who aren&#8217;t well-&#8220;leveraged&#8221; and don&#8217;t quite feel prepared for success . . . or know what to do once we&#8217;ve made it.  *Entertainment Weekly</p>

<p>                    The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work. A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people&#8211;including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the &#8220;song of the universe, the music of the spheres.&#8221; With Bill Moyers, one of America&#8217;s most prominent journalists, as his thoughtful and engaging interviewer, The Power of Myth touches on subjects from modern marriage to virgin births, from Jesus to John Lennon, offering a brilliant combination of intelligence and wit.     </p>
<p>                    This extraordinary book reveals how the themes and symbols of ancient narratives continue to bring meaning to birth, death, love, and war. From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell&#8217;s work, The Power of Myth continues to exert a profound influence on our culture.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few could explain, let alone seek out, a career in criticism. Yet what A. O. Scott shows in Better Living Through Criticism is that we are, in fact, all critics: because critical thinking informs almost every aspect of artistic creation, of civil action, of interpersonal life. With penetrating insight and humour, Scott shows that while individual critics &#8211; himself included &#8211; can make mistakes and find flaws where they shouldn&#8217;t, criticism as a discipline is one of the noblest, most creative and urgent activities.    </p>
<p>                    Using his own film criticism as a starting point &#8211; everything from an infamous dismissal of the international blockbuster The Avengers to his intense affection for Pixar&#8217;s animated Ratatouille &#8211; Scott expands outwards, easily guiding readers through the complexities of Rilke and Shelley, the origins of Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, the power of Marina Abramovic and &#8216;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#8217; Scott shows that real criticism was and always will be the breath of fresh air that allows true creativity to thrive. As he puts it: &#8216;The time for criticism is always now, because the imperative to think clearly, never goes away.&#8217;</p>

<p>                    &#8220;There Kevin Young goes again, giving us books we greatly need, cleverly disguised as books we merely want. Unexpectedly essential.&#8221;&#8211;Marlon James     </p>
<p>                    Award-winning poet and critic Kevin Young tours us through a rogue&#8217;s gallery of hoaxers, plagiarists, forgers, and fakers&#8211;from the humbug of P. T. Barnum and Edgar Allan Poe to the unrepentant bunk of JT LeRoy and Donald J. Trump. Bunk traces the history of the hoax as a peculiarly American phenomenon, examining what motivates hucksters and makes the rest of us so gullible. Disturbingly, Young finds that fakery is woven from stereotype and suspicion, race being the most insidious American hoax of all. He chronicles how Barnum came to fame by displaying figures like Joice Heth, a black woman whom he pretended was the 161-year-old nursemaid to George Washington, and What Is It?, an African American man Barnum professed was a newly discovered missing link in evolution.    </p>
<p>                    Bunk then turns to the hoaxing of history and the ways that forgers, plagiarists, and journalistic fakers invent backstories and falsehoods to sell us lies about themselves and about the world in our own time, from pretend Native Americans Grey Owl and Nasdijj to the deadly imposture of Clark Rockefeller, from the made-up memoirs of James Frey to the identity theft of Rachel Dolezal. In this brilliant and timely work, Young asks what it means to live in a post-factual world of &#8220;truthiness&#8221; where everything is up for interpretation and everyone is subject to a pervasive cynicism that damages our ideas of reality, fact, and art.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A thoroughly revised and updated edition of Thomas C. Foster&#8217;s classic guide-a lively and entertaining introduction to literature and literary basics, including symbols, themes and contexts, that shows you how to make your everyday reading experience more rewarding and enjoyable.  While many books can be enjoyed for their basic stories, there are often deeper literary meanings interwoven in these texts. How to Read Literature Like a Professor helps us to discover those hidden truths by looking at literature with the eyes-and the literary codes-of the ultimate professional reader, the college professor.  What does it mean when a literary hero is traveling along a dusty road? When he hands a drink to his companion? When he&#8217;s drenched in a sudden rain shower?  Ranging from major themes to literary models, narrative devices and form, Thomas C. Foster provides us with a broad overview of literature-a world where a road leads to a quest, a shared meal may signify a communion, and rain, whether cleansing or destructive, is never just a shower-and shows us how to make our reading experience more enriching, satisfying, and fun.<br />
                    This revised edition includes new chapters, a new preface and epilogue, and incorporates updated teaching points that Foster has developed over the past decade.</p>

<p>                    Long before there were creative writing workshops and degrees, how did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries, says Francine Prose.     </p>
<p>                     As she takes us on a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters&#8211;Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, Woolf, Chekhov&#8211;Prose discovers why these writers endure. She takes pleasure in the signature elements of such outsatanding writers as Philip Roth, Isaac Babel, John Le Carré, James Joyce, and Katherine Mansfield. Throughout, she cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted.
