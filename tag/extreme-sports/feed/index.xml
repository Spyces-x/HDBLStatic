<p>                    Right now, more people are risking their lives for their sports then ever before in history. As Thomas Pynchon once put it in Gravity&#8217;s Rainbow, &#8216;it is not often that Death is told so clearly to f@%* off&#8217;.     </p>
<p>                    Over the past three decades, the bounds of the possible in action and adventure sports &#8211; from sky-diving to motocross to surfing and beyond &#8211; have been pushed farther and faster. A generation&#8217;s worth of iconoclastic misfits have rewritten the rules of the feasible; not just raising the bar, but obliterating it altogether. Along the way, they have become a force pushing evolution relentlessly onward.     </p>
<p>                    In a thrilling narrative that draws on biology, psychology, and philosophy, Steven Kotler asks why, at the tail end of the 20th century and the early portion of the 21st, are we seeing such a multi-sport assault on reality? Did we somehow slip through a wormhole to another universe where gravity is optional and common sense obsolete? And where &#8211; if anywhere &#8211; do our actual limits lie?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the heart of Born to Run lies a mysterious tribe of Mexican Indians, the Tarahumara, who live quietly in canyons and are reputed to be the best distance runners in the world; in 1993, one of them, aged 57, came first in a prestigious 100-mile race wearing a toga and sandals. A small group of the world&#8217;s top ultra-runners (and the awe-inspiring author) make the treacherous journey into the canyons to try to learn the tribe&#8217;s secrets and then take them on over a course 50 miles long.    </p>
<p>                    With incredible energy and smart observation, McDougall tells this story while asking what the secrets are to being an incredible runner. Travelling to labs at Harvard, Nike, and elsewhere, he comes across an incredible cast of characters, including the woman who recently broke the world record for 100 miles and for her encore ran a 2:50 marathon in a bikini, pausing to down a beer at the 20 mile mark.</p>
