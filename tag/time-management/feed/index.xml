										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the founders of the trailblazing software company 37signals, here is a different kind of business book &#8211; one that explores a new reality. Today, anyone can be in business. Tools that used to be out of reach are now easily accessible. Technology that cost thousands is now just a few pounds or even free. Stuff that was impossible just a few years ago is now simple.     </p>
<p>                    That means anyone can start a business. And you can do it without working miserable 80-hour weeks or depleting your life savings. You can start it on the side while your day job provides all the cash flow you need. Forget about business plans, meetings, office space &#8211; you don&#8217;t need them.    </p>
<p>                    With its straightforward language and easy-is-better approach, Rework is the perfect playbook for anyone who&#8217;s ever dreamed of doing it on their own. Hardcore entrepreneurs, small-business owners, people stuck in day jobs who want to get out, and artists who don&#8217;t want to starve anymore will all find valuable inspiration and guidance in these pages.     </p>
<p>                    It&#8217;s time to rework work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We live in the age of speed. We strain to be more efficient, to cram more into each minute, each hour, each day. Since the Industrial Revolution shifted the world into high gear, the cult of speed has pushed us to a breaking point. Consider these facts: Americans on average spend seventy-two minutes of every day behind the wheel of a car, a typical business executive now loses sixty-eight hours a year to being put on hold, and American adults currently devote on average a mere half hour per week to making love.    </p>
<p>                    Living on the edge of exhaustion, we are constantly reminded by our bodies and minds that the pace of life is spinning out of control. In Praise of Slowness traces the history of our increasingly breathless relationship with time and tackles the consequences of living in this accelerated culture of our own creation. Why are we always in such a rush? What is the cure for time sickness? Is it possible, or even desirable, to slow down? Realizing the price we pay for unrelenting speed, people all over the world are reclaiming their time and slowing down the pace &#8212; and living happier, healthier, and more productive lives as a result. A Slow revolution is taking place.    </p>
<p>                    Here you will find no Luddite calls to overthrow technology and seek a preindustrial utopia. This is a modern revolution, championed by cell-phone using, e-mailing lovers of sanity. The Slow philosophy can be summed up in a single word &#8212; balance. People are discovering energy and efficiency where they may have been least expected &#8212; in slowing down.    </p>
<p>                    In this engaging and entertaining exploration, award-winning journalist and rehabilitated speedaholic Carl Honoré details our perennial love affair with efficiency and speed in a perfect blend of anecdotal reportage, history, and intellectual inquiry. In Praise of Slowness is the first comprehensive look at the worldwide Slow movements making their way into the mainstream &#8212; in offices, factories, neighborhoods, kitchens, hospitals, concert halls, bedrooms, gyms, and schools. Defining a movement that is here to stay, this spirited manifesto will make you completely rethink your relationship with time.</p>

<p>                    Have you ever felt both overworked and underutilised?     </p>
<p>                    Do you ever feel busy but not productive?     </p>
<p>                    If you answered yes to any of these, the way out is to become an Essentialist.     </p>
<p>                    In Essentialism, Greg McKeown, CEO of a Leadership and Strategy agency in Silicon Valley who has run courses at Apple, Google and Facebook, shows you how to achieve what he calls the disciplined pursuit of less. Being an Essentialist is about a disciplined way of thinking. It means challenging the core assumption of &#8216;We can have it all&#8217; and &#8216;I have to do everything&#8217; and replacing it with the pursuit of &#8216;the right thing, in the right way, at the right time&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    By applying a more selective criteria for what is essential, the pursuit of less allows us to regain control of our own choices so we can channel our time, energy and effort into making the highest possible contribution toward the goals and activities that matter.     </p>
<p>                    Using the experience and insight of working with the leaders of the most innovative companies and organisations in the world, McKeown shows you how to put Essentialism into practice in your own life, so you too can achieve something great.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE BUSINESS BOOK AWARDS 2021    </p>
<p>                    In The 4 Day Week, entrepreneur and business innovator Andrew Barnes makes the case for the four-day work week as the answer to many of the ills of the 21st-century global economy.     </p>
<p>                     Barnes conducted an experiment in his own business, the New Zealand trust company Perpetual Guardian, and asked his staff to design a four-day week that would permit them to meet their existing productivity requirements on the same salary but with a 20% cut in work hours. The outcomes of this trial, which no business leader had previously attempted on these terms, were stunning. People were happier and healthier, more engaged in their personal lives, and more focused and productive in the office.    </p>
<p>                     The world of work has seen a dramatic shift in recent times: the former security and benefits associated with permanent employment are being displaced by the less stable gig economy. Barnes explains the dangers of a focus on flexibility at the expense of hard-won worker protections, and argues that with the four-day week, we can have the best of all worlds: optimal productivity, work-life balance, worker benefits and, at long last, a solution to pervasive economic inequities such as the gender pay gap and lack of diversity in business and governance.     </p>
<p>                     The 4 Day Week is a practical, how-to guide for business leaders and employees alike that is applicable to nearly every industry. Using qualitative and quantitative data from research gathered through the Perpetual Guardian trial and other sources by the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology, the book presents a step-by-step approach to preparing businesses for productivity-focused flexibility, from the necessary cultural conditions to the often complex legislative considerations.    </p>
<p>                     The story of Perpetual Guardian&#8217;s unprecedented work experiment has made headlines around the world and stormed social media, reaching a global audience in more than seventy countries. A mix of trenchant analysis, personal observation and actionable advice, The 4 Day Week is an essential guide for leaders and workers seeking to make a change for the better in their work world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fun, interesting, and useful read!&#8217; David Allen, bestselling author of Getting Things Done    </p>
<p>                    Nearly all of us want to be more productive, but finding the method that works for you among the hundreds and hundreds of different tips, tricks and hacks can be a daunting prospect. After graduating college, Chris Bailey decided to dedicate a whole year to doing just that &#8211; experimenting with as many of the techniques as he could, and finding the things that work. Among the experiments that he undertook are: going several weeks on little to no sleep; cutting out caffeine and sugar; taking a daily siesta; living in total isolation for 10 days; stretching his workweek to 90 hours; and getting up at 5:30 every morning,  all the while monitoring the impact of his experiments on the quality and quantity of his work. The results were often surprising!     </p>
<p>                    This book is the result of Chris&#8217;s year-long journey, distilling the lessons he learned into a few core truths about how we get things done (or, indeed, don&#8217;t).  Among the many counterintuitive insights Chris discovered that had the biggest impact on his productivity were striving for imperfection; scheduling less time for important tasks; the 20 second rule to distract yourself from distractions; and the concept of productive procrastination.     </p>
<p>                    In this accessible and fun guide, Chris Bailey offers over 30 tried-and-tested best practices that will help everyone to accomplish more &#8211; and become more awesome.</p>

<p>                    Your time is under attack. You just can&#8217;t get enough done. You find yourself wondering where the hours go. You&#8217;ve tried every time-management system you can get your hands on&#8211;and they&#8217;ve only succeeded in making your work more complicated.     </p>
<p>                    Sound familiar?     </p>
<p>                    If you sometimes feel you spend more time managing your productivity than doing actual work, it&#8217;s time for a change. In Work Simply, renowned productivity expert Carson Tate offers a step-by-step guide to making work simple again by using the style that works best for you.     </p>
<p>                    Tate has helped thousands of men and women better manage their time and become more productive. Her success owes partly to the realization that most of us fit into one of four distinct productivity styles: Arrangers, who think about their projects in terms of the people involved; Prioritizers, who are the definition of &#8220;goal-oriented&#8221;; Visualizers, who possess a unique ability to comprehend the big picture; and Planners, who live for the details.     </p>
<p>                    In this book, you&#8217;ll learnHow to identify your own productivity style as well as the styles of those around you&#8211;bosses, coworkers, staff, and family.How to select your &#8220;tools of the trade&#8221; to maximize your effectiveness, from the style of pen you use to the way you decorate your office.When face-to-face conversations are more effective than e-mails&#8211;and vice versa.What it takes to lead the perfect meeting.Why a messy desk is right for some, but a disaster for others&#8211;and how to tell.<br />
                    After reading Work Simply, you&#8217;ll come away with a productivity system that truly and fundamentally fits you&#8211;and you&#8217;ll never feel overwhelmed again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ONE OF AMAZON&#8217;S BEST BUSINESS BOOKS OF 2018 SO FAR<br />
                    ONE OF THE FINANCIAL TIMES&#8217; BUSINESS BOOKS OF THE MONTH UPON RELEASE<br />
                    ONE OF BUSINESS INSIDER&#8217;S BEST BUSINESS BOOKS TO READ THIS SUMMER    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This small book carries the irresistible implicit promise that if you follow the morning routines of famous, important and successful people, you will become famous, important and successful yourself.&#8217; Financial Times    </p>
<p>                    How are you spending your most valuable hours? The first few choices you make each morning can unlock greater productivity, creativity, and calm &#8211; or bring out your worst self.    </p>
<p>                    Marie Kondo performs a quick tidying ritual to quiet her mind before leaving the house. The president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Ed Catmull, mixes three shots of espresso with three scoops of cocoa powder and two sweeteners. Retired U.S.Army Four-Star General Stanley McChrystal works out at 4:00 AM every day for at least an hour.     </p>
<p>                     Part instruction manual, part someone else&#8217;s diary, My Morning Routine interviews sixty-four of today&#8217;s most successful people &#8211; including Biz Stone, the co-founder of Twitter; Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post; and Michael Acton Smith, the CEO of Calm &#8211; and offers timeless advice on creating a routine of your own.    </p>
<p>                     Some routines are all about early-morning exercise and spartan living; others are more leisurely and self-indulgent. Whether you want to boost your productivity, implement a workout or meditation routine, or learn to roll with the punches in the morning, this book has you covered.     </p>
<p>                    Once you land on the right routine, you&#8217;ll look forward to waking up.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    From inside the book:     </p>
<p>                     &#8216;A big part of my morning routine is about what I don&#8217;t do: when I wake up, I don&#8217;t start the day by looking at my phone&#8217; &#8211; ARIANNA HUFFINGTON, founder of the Huffington Post and Thrive Global    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;I travel a lot for work, so my days are always different. Having a morning routine really means fitting things in around everything else&#8217; &#8211; CAMERON RUSSELL, fashion model and cultural activist I    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;if I don&#8217;t get a chance to play with my son in the morning I feel like I missed something that I&#8217;ll never get back&#8217; &#8211; BIZ STONE, cofounder of Twitter    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Find certain things you know you should do, don&#8217;t like to do, or make excuses to avoid, and then do them every day&#8217; &#8211; STANLEY McCHRYSTAL, retired U.S. Army four-star general    </p>

<p>                    18 MINUTES takes this challenge and turns it on its head. Peter Bregman, top HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW columnist and global management consultant, shatters the myth of getting it all done by offering a clear and simple plan for getting the right things done.     </p>
<p>                    He shows how the best way to fight distracting interruptions is to create productive ones ourselves, a practice that can be easily implemented in 18 minutes a day. The result is a simple yet comprehensive approach to managing your life a year, a day, and a moment at a time so that your life moves forward the way you want and at the pace you want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Find the time, clarity, and mental space to achieve your goals The Free-Time Formula helps you slow down time and get the important things done. We&#8217;re all overworked, stressed, and always being asked to do more, and do it better; the days aren&#8217;t getting any longer, so something has to give-don&#8217;t let it be your sanity. This book provides a real-world framework for more effective time management that helps you prioritize, focus, clarify, and go. You&#8217;ll begin with a time audit to assess your current stress, strategies, and output-and the results may shock you. From there, you&#8217;ll work step-by-step toward a new daily routine that will help you become the focused, efficient achiever you&#8217;ve been trying to be for so long. It&#8217;s not about cramming more into your precious 24 hours, it&#8217;s about figuring out what really matters to you, and getting the most important things done first. Every day. Never miss another big deadline, never flake on an important meeting, never be late to an appointment again. It is possible with great planning, and this book is your personal guide.     </p>
<p>                    Focused on action, not filler, this book is an excellent resource for those who want to achieve more, but do less. With a few simple changes, you&#8217;ll find the time you&#8217;ve been missing and put it to more productive use.     </p>
<p>                    Define and prioritize your personal and professional goals and responsibilities<br />
                    Cut the distractions and clarify your daily objectives<br />
                    Adapt your workplace tools and environment to facilitate actual work<br />
                    Periodically self-assess, course-correct when needed, and plan for the future    </p>
<p>                     Rather than rush through another day leaving things un-done and roses un-sniffed, take a beat and a breath, and take back your day with The Free-Time Formula.</p>

<p>                    Do you regularly find yourself in long, unstructured meetings which end without a decision? Are you a team leader looking for tips on increasing productivity? Or are you looking for ways to enhance collaboration?    </p>
<p>                    Six Thinking Hats, Edward de Bono&#8217;s classic book on meetings, remains as relevant as ever. Used to huge success by big companies and organisations such as IBM, Siemens and NASA, the Six-Hats method is a proven way to:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Reduce meeting lengths to one quarter of what they were previously<br />
                    &#8211; Make decisions in just 15 minutes, rather than 3 hours<br />
                    &#8211; Increase productivity by nearly 500%    </p>
<p>                    This extremely simple tool not only increases efficiency in discussions and decision-making, but also encourages openness and trust among colleagues, resulting in happier team, a rise in productivity, and decisions which almost make themselves.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An inspiring man with brilliant ideas. De Bono never ceases to amaze&#8217; Sir Richard Branson</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Communicate, congregate and collaborate more effectively than ever    </p>
<p>                     Smart Teams will help your team to go beyond personal productivity to enhance team productivity. Building on the concepts presented in Smart Work, which focuses on personal productivity, this book shows you how to turn unproductive team behaviours that create friction into &#8216;superproductive&#8217; behaviours that promote flow. Productivity is, at its core, a leadership issue &#8211; and this book provides practical guidelines that help you build a culture where productivity thrives.    </p>
<p>                     Working together can be a drag &#8211; literally. Email noise, unproductive meetings and poorly organised projects can stifle creativity and disrupt everyone&#8217;s workflow. But by creating team agreements that raise awareness of the negative impact of our behaviours, you build the desire and capability to change. This book is packed with tips, guidelines and expert insights for leaders and managers at any level.    </p>
<p>                    Foster a culture of &#8216;superproductivity&#8217;<br />
                    Create a set of Smart Team principles to guide cooperation<br />
                    Run fewer, shorter and more effective meetings<br />
                    Collaborate more productively on projects<br />
                    Reduce urgency, interruptions and email noise    </p>
<p>                     People want their work to matter, they want to make an impact and they want to do it all with a healthy work-life balance &#8211; productivity is the key to making it all happen.  Smart Teams shows you how to implement the culture shift that will allow your team to flourish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Laura Vanderkam is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in time management and productivity . . . her insights in Off the Clock can change your life&#8217; &#8211; Dorie Clark, author of Stand Out    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Laura Vanderkam delivers a compelling and evidence-based argument that busyness is overrated in our current culture. Living a full life, at work and at home, is about doing the right things well, and confidently missing out on everything else&#8217; &#8211; Cal Newport, bestselling author of Deep Work    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved it . . . Vanderkam expertly weaves together interviews with experts, anecdotes about her own personal life, philosophical musings, and scientific research&#8217; &#8211; Shana Lebowitz, Business Insider UK    </p>
<p>                    Learn to savour life&#8217;s best moments &#8211; no matter how busy you are &#8211; through mindset shifts that alter your perception of time.    </p>
<p>                    Laura Vanderkam, the acclaimed author of What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast, isn&#8217;t like other time-management gurus. She&#8217;s not trying to shave off 30 seconds here or there; she&#8217;s interested in the emotional and psychological side of the 168 hours everyone has each week. Her message is that we all have more time than we think we do, and can feel less stressed while getting more done.     </p>
<p>                    With the right habits, you can live efficiently and effectively, and yet still see time as abundant. For instance, Vanderkam teaches:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to clear your calendar of activities that are boring, stressful or simply not the best use of your time    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Why tackling your top priorities during the hours when you have the most energy will change your perception of what it means to be productive    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How to linger in great experiences while they&#8217;re happening, and why good memories seem to make time expand    </p>
<p>                    Packed with insights from busy yet relaxed professionals, including &#8216;time makeovers&#8217; of people who are learning to use these tools, Off the Clock can inspire the rest of us to creative lives that are not only productive, but enjoyable in the moment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is your phone the first thing you reach for when you wake up? And the  last thing you see before you sleep? Do you find the hours slip away as  you idly scroll through your social media timeline?     </p>
<p>                     In short, are you addicted to your phone? If so, How to Break Up with Your Phone is here to help.     </p>
<p>                     How to Break Up With Your Phone  is a smart, practical and useful plan to help you conquer your mobile  phone addiction in just 30 days &#8211; and take back your life in the  process.     </p>
<p>                    Recent studies have shown that spending extended time  on our phones affects our ability to form new memories, think deeply,  focus and absorb information, and the hormones triggered every time we  hear our phones buzz both add to our stress levels and are the hallmark  signs of addiction. In How to Break Up with Your Phone,  award-winning science journalist Catherine Price explores the effects  that our constant connectivity is having on our brains, bodies,  relationships, and society at large and asks, how much time do you really want to spend on your phone?     </p>
<p>                    Over  the course of 30 days, Catherine will guide you through an  easy-to-follow plan that enables you to identify your goals, priorities  and bad habits, tidy your apps, prune your email, and take time away.  Lastly, you will create a new, healthier relationship with your phone  and establish habits and routines to ensure this new relationship  sticks.     </p>
<p>                    You don&#8217;t have to give up your phone forever; instead  you will be more mindful not only of how you use your phone, but also  about how you choose to spend the precious moments of your life.</p>

                    ___________________________________________________<br />
                     Overwhelmed by demands on your time? Baffled by the sheer volume of data?<br />
                    You&#8217;re not alone. Even the smartest mind can&#8217;t beat the organized mind &#8211; when we&#8217;re unable to make sense of it all, our creativity plummets, our decision making suffers and we grow absent-minded. Nowadays, we drown under emails, forever juggle six tasks at once and try to make complex decisions ever more quickly. This is information overload.    </p>
<p>                     Using a combination of academic research and examples from daily life, Daniel Levitin explains how to take back control of your life, from healthcare to online dating to raising kids, showing that the secret to success is always organization. You&#8217;ll discover life-changing facts about:    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; How to make the most of your brain&#8217;s daily processing limit<br />
                     &#8211; Why pressing Send or clicking Like are addictive<br />
                     &#8211; Why daydreaming is your brain at its most productive<br />
                     &#8211; What the most successful people keep in their drawer<br />
                     &#8211; Why multitasking is a bad way to do nearly everything    </p>
<p>                     In a world where information is power, The Organized Mind holds the key to harnessing that information and making it work for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*#GIRLBOSS NETFLIX ORIGINAL OUT NOW*    </p>
<p>                    In this New York Times bestselling sensation, founder and Executive Chairman of Nasty Gal Sophia Amoruso shares her story and inspires women everywhere to join the #GIRLBOSS movement.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;#GIRLBOSS is more than a book . . . #GIRLBOSS is a movement&#8217; Lena Dunham    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A millennial alternative to Lean In&#8217; New York Magazine    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compellingly motivational read&#8217; The Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The book you need in your life&#8217; Marie Claire     </p>
<p>                    *Winner of the 2014 Goodreads Choice Award for Best Business Book*    </p>
<p>                    In the space of ten years, Sophia Amoruso has gone from high-school dropout to founder and Executive Chairman of Nasty Gal, one of the fastest-growing retailers in the world.     </p>
<p>                    Sophia&#8217;s never been a typical executive, or a typical anything, and she&#8217;s written #GIRLBOSS for other girls like her: outsiders (and insiders) seeking a unique path to success.    </p>
<p>                    Filled with brazen wake-up calls, cunning and frank observations, and behind-the-scenes stories from Nasty Gal&#8217;s meteoric rise, #GIRLBOSS covers a lot of ground. It proves that success doesn&#8217;t come from where you went to college or how popular you were in school. Success is about trusting your instincts and following your gut, knowing which rules to follow and which to break.    </p>
<p>                    Inspiring, motivating and empowering, #GIRLBOSS will give you the kick up the ass you need to reach your potential.</p>

                    &#8220;&#8230;multitasking is, in fact, a lie that actually wastes time, energy, and money. Most of all, it robs us of life and our relationships with others.&#8221; -Chuck Norris, world-renowned actor and martial artist     </p>
<p>                    Through anecdotal and real-world examples, The Myth of Multitasking proves that multitasking hurts your focus and productivity. Instead, learn how to be more effective by doing one thing at a time.    </p>
<p>                    Productivity and effective time management end with multitasking. The false idea that multitasking is productive has become even more prevalent and damaging to our productivity and well-being since the first edition of The Myth of Multitasking was published in 2008. In this revised and updated second edition, author and productivity expert Dave Crenshaw provides a solution for the chaos of distraction that multitasking creates-and a way to combat the temptation to constantly switch between tasks.    </p>
<p>                    Learn how to actually get things done. Dave Crenshaw takes the idea of multitasking as a productivity tool and smashes it to smithereens. But rather than leaving you with the burden of wading through the wreckage all by yourself, he shows you how to focus, move forward, and free up more time for what you value the most.    </p>
<p>                    In this new edition of The Myth of Multitasking, discover:    </p>
<p>                    Updated research on how and why multitasking doesn&#8217;t work<br />
                    Worksheets to help you figure out how to manage your day effectively<br />
                    Easy, actionable steps to manage your life well and accomplish your dreams and goals    </p>
<p>                    Readers of self-improvement books and time management books like Indistractable, Free to Focus, or It Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Crazy at Work will love increasing productivity and personal success with The Myth of Multitasking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Machines need to be productive. People need to be effective.Productivity books focus on doing more, Jim and Tonianne want you to focus on doing better. Personal Kanban is about choosing the right work at the right time. Recognizing why we do the things we do. Understanding the impact of our actions. Creating value &#8211; not just product. For ourselves, our families, our friends, our co-workers. For our legacy.Personal Kanban takes the same Lean principles from manufacturing that led the Japanese auto industry to become a global leader in quality, and applies them to individual and team work. Personal Kanban asks only that we visualize our work and limit our work-in-progress. Visualizing work allows us to transform our conceptual and threatening workload into an actionable, context-sensitive flow. Limiting our work-in-progress helps us complete what we start and understand the value of our choices. Combined, these two simple acts encourage us to improve the way we work and the way we make choices to balance our personal, professional, and social lives.Neither a prescription nor a plan, Personal Kanban provides a light, actionable, achievable framework for understanding our work and its context. This book describes why students, parents, business leaders, major corporations, and world governments all see immediate results with Personal Kanban.</p>
