										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every year, almost 4,000,000 students begin their freshman year at colleges and universities nationwide. Most of them will sleep less and stress out a whole lot more. By the end of the year, 30% of those freshmen will have dropped out. For many, the unforeseen demands of college life are so overwhelming that &#8220;the best four years of your life&#8221; can start to feel like the worst.    </p>
<p>                    Enter Daniel Lerner and Dr. Alan Schlechter, ready to teach students how to not only survive college, but flourish in it.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; From two survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting comes a declaration for our times, and an in-depth look at the making of the #NeverAgain movement. On February 14, 2018, seventeen-year-old David Hogg and his fourteen-year-old sister, Lauren, went to school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, like any normal Wednesday. That day, of course, the world changed. By the next morning, with seventeen classmates and faculty dead, they had joined the leadership of a movement to save their own lives, and the lives of all other young people in America. It&#8217;s a leadership position they did not seek, and did not want&#8211;but events gave them no choice. The morning after the massacre, David Hogg told CNN: We&#8217;re children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together. Get over your politics and get something done. This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America&#8211;with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed. With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve. Born just after Columbine and raised amid seemingly endless war and routine active shooter drills, this generation now says, Enough. This book is their statement of purpose, and the story of their lives. It is the essential guide to the #NeverAgain movement.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>America has long compared its students to top-performing kids of other nations. But how do the world&#8217;s education superpowers look through the eyes of an American high school student? Author Amanda Ripley follows three teenagers who chose to spend one school year living and learning in Finland, South Korea, and Poland. Through their adventures, Ripley discovers startling truths about how attitudes, parenting, and rigorous teaching have revolutionized these countries&#8217; education results.     </p>
<p>                    In The Smartest Kids in the World, Ripley&#8217;s astonishing new insights reveal that top-performing countries have achieved greatness only in the past several decades; that the kids who live there are learning to think for themselves, partly through failing early and often; and that persistence, hard work, and resilience matter more to our children&#8217;s life chances than self-esteem or sports.     </p>
<p>                    Ripley&#8217;s investigative work seamlessly weaves narrative and research, providing in-depth analysis and gripping details that will keep you turning the pages. Written in a clear and engaging style, The Smartest Kids in the World will enliven public as well as dinner table debates over what makes for brighter and better students.</p>
