										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revelatory journey inside the world of Fox News and Roger Ailes&#8211;the brash, sometimes combative network head who helped fuel the rise of Donald Trump</p>
<p>                    NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; NOW A SHOWTIME LIMITED SERIES &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR </p>
<p>                     When Rupert Murdoch enlisted Roger Ailes to launch a cable news network in 1996, American politics and media changed forever. With a remarkable level of detail and insight, Vanity Fair magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman puts Ailes&#8217;s unique genius on display, along with the outsize personalities&#8211;Bill O&#8217;Reilly, Sean Hannity, Megyn Kelly, Sarah Palin, Karl Rove, Glenn Beck, Mike Huckabee, Gretchen Carlson, Bill Shine, and others&#8211;who have helped Fox News play a defining role in the great social and political controversies of the past two decades. From the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal to the Bush-Gore recount, from the war in Iraq to the Tea Party attack on the Obama presidency, Roger Ailes developed an unrivaled power to sway the national agenda. Even more, he became the indispensable figure in conservative America and the man any Republican politician with presidential aspirations had to court. </p>
<p>                     How did this man become the master strategist of our political landscape? In revelatory detail, Sherman chronicles the rise of Ailes, a frail kid from an Ohio factory town who, through sheer willpower, the flair of a showman, fierce corporate politicking, and a profound understanding of the priorities of middle America, built the most influential television news empire of our time. </p>
<p>                     Drawing on hundreds of interviews with Fox News insiders past and present, Sherman documents Ailes&#8217;s tactical acuity as he battled the press, business rivals, and countless real and perceived enemies inside and outside Fox. Sherman takes us inside the morning meetings in which Ailes and other high-level executives strategized Fox&#8217;s presentation of the news to advance Ailes&#8217;s political agenda; provides behind-the-scenes details of Ailes&#8217;s crucial role as finder and shaper of talent, including his sometimes rocky relationships with Fox News stars such as O&#8217;Reilly, Hannity, and Carlson; and probes Ailes&#8217;s fraught partnership with his equally brash and mercurial boss, Rupert Murdoch. </p>
<p>                     Roger Ailes&#8217;s life is a story worthy of Citizen Kane. Featuring an afterword about Ailes&#8217;s epic downfall during the extraordinary 2016 election, The Loudest Voice in the Room is an extraordinary feat of reportage with a compelling human drama at its heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Distrust That Particular Flavor &#8211; an acclaimed nonfiction collection by William Gibson, bestselling author of Neuromancer</p>
<p>                    &#8216;The future&#8217;s already here: it&#8217;s just not evenly distributed&#8217;</p>
<p>                    William Gibson was writing fiction when he predicted the internet. And as his stories bled into reality so he became one of the first to report on the real-world consequences of cyberspace&#8217;s growth and development.</p>
<p>                    Now, with the dust settling on the first internet revolution, comes Gibson&#8217;s first collection of non-fiction &#8211; essays from the technological and cultural frontiers of this new world. </p>
<p>                    Covering a variety of subjects, they include:</p>
<p>                    &#8211; Metrophagy &#8211; the Art and Science of Digesting Great Cities<br />
                    &#8211; An account of obsession in &#8216;the world&#8217;s attic&#8217; &#8211; eBay<br />
                    &#8211; Reasons why &#8216;The Net is a Waste of Time&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; Singapore as &#8216;Disneyland with the Death Penalty&#8217;<br />
                    &#8211; A primer on Japan, our default setting for the future </p>
<p>                    These and many other pieces, collected for the first time in Distrust that Particular Flavour, are studded with revealing autobiographical fragments and map the development of Gibson&#8217;s acute perceptions about modern life. Readers of Neal Stephenson, Ray Bradbury and Iain M. Banks will love this book.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Gibson is a prophet and a satirist, a black comedian and an astounding architect of cool. He&#8217;s also responsible for much of the world we live in&#8217; Spectator</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Part-detective story, part-cultural snapshot &#8230; all bound by Gibson&#8217;s pin-sharp prose&#8217; Arena</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER</p>
<p>                    Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.</p>
<p>                    In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.</p>
<p>                    Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online &#8211; a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet&#8217;s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A FINANCIAL TIMES BOOK OF THE MONTH      </p>
<p>                     FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: &#8220;Nothing Mr. Gilder says or writes is ever delivered at anything less than the fullest philosophical decibel&#8230; Mr. Gilder sounds less like a tech guru than a poet, and his words tumble out in a romantic cascade.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Google&#8217;s algorithms assume the world&#8217;s future is nothing more than the next moment in a random process. George Gilder shows how deep this assumption goes, what motivates people to make it, and why it&#8217;s wrong: the future depends on human action.&#8221; &#8212; Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and Palantir Technologies and author of Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future     </p>
<p>                     The Age of Google, built on big data and machine intelligence, has been an awesome era. But it&#8217;s coming to an end. In Life after Google, George Gilder&#8211;the peerless visionary of technology and culture&#8211;explains why Silicon Valley is suffering a nervous breakdown and what to expect as the post-Google age dawns.     </p>
<p>                     Google&#8217;s astonishing ability to &#8220;search and sort&#8221; attracts the entire world to its search engine and countless other goodies&#8211;videos, maps, email, calendars&#8230;.And everything it offers is free, or so it seems. Instead of paying directly, users submit to advertising. The system of &#8220;aggregate and advertise&#8221; works&#8211;for a while&#8211;if you control an empire of data centers, but a market without prices strangles entrepreneurship and turns the Internet into a wasteland of ads.     </p>
<p>                     The crisis is not just economic. Even as advances in artificial intelligence induce delusions of omnipotence and transcendence, Silicon Valley has pretty much given up on security. The Internet firewalls supposedly protecting all those passwords and personal information have proved hopelessly permeable.     </p>
<p>                     The crisis cannot be solved within the current computer and network architecture. The future lies with the &#8220;cryptocosm&#8221;&#8211;the new architecture of the blockchain and its derivatives. Enabling cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and ether, NEO and Hashgraph, it will provide the Internet a secure global payments system, ending the aggregate-and-advertise Age of Google.     </p>
<p>                     Silicon Valley, long dominated by a few giants, faces a &#8220;great unbundling,&#8221; which will disperse computer power and commerce and transform the economy and the Internet.     </p>
<p>                     Life after Google is almost here.     </p>
<p>                     For fans of &#8220;Wealth and Poverty,&#8221; &#8220;Knowledge and Power,&#8221; and &#8220;The Scandal of Money.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behind the bitter rivalry between Apple and Google-and how it&#8217;s reshaping the way we think about technology    </p>
<p>                    The rise of smartphones and tablets has altered the industry of making computers. At the center of this change are Apple and Google, two companies whose philosophies, leaders, and commercial acumen have steamrolled the competition. In the age of Android and the iPad, these corporations are locked in a feud that will play out not just in the mobile marketplace but in the courts and on screens around the world.<br />
                    Fred Vogelstein has reported on this rivalry for more than a decade and has rare access to its major players. In Dogfight, he takes us into the offices and board rooms where company dogma translates into ruthless business; behind outsize personalities like Steve Jobs, Apple&#8217;s now-lionized CEO, and Eric Schmidt, Google&#8217;s executive chairman; and inside the deals, lawsuits, and allegations that mold the way we communicate. Apple and Google are poaching each other&#8217;s employees. They bid up the price of each other&#8217;s acquisitions for spite, and they forge alliances with major players like Facebook and Microsoft in pursuit of market dominance.<br />
                    Dogfight reads like a novel: vivid nonfiction with never-before-heard details. This is more than a story about what devices will replace our cell phones and laptops. It&#8217;s about who will control the content on those devices and where that content will come from-about the future of media and the Internet in Silicon Valley, New York, and Hollywood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humility Is the New Smart     </p>
<p>                     Your job is at risk&#8211;if not now, then soon. We are on the leading edge of a Smart Machine Age led by artificial intelligence that will be as transformative for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. Smart machines will take over millions of jobs in manufacturing, office work, the service sector, the professions, you name it. Not only can they know more data and analyze it faster than any mere human, say Edward Hess and Katherine Ludwig, but smart machines are free of the emotional, psychological, and cultural baggage that so often mars human thinking.     </p>
<p>                     So we can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em and we can&#8217;t join &#8217;em. To stay relevant, we have to play a different game. Hess and Ludwig offer us that game plan. We need to excel at critical, creative, and innovative thinking and at genuinely engaging with others&#8211;things machines can&#8217;t do well. The key is to change our definition of what it means to be smart. Hess and Ludwig call it being NewSmart. In this extraordinarily timely book, they offer detailed guidance for developing NewSmart attitudes and four critical behaviors that will help us adapt to the new reality.     </p>
<p>                     The crucial mindset underlying NewSmart is humility&#8211;not self-effacement but an accurate self-appraisal: acknowledging you can&#8217;t have all the answers, remaining open to new ideas, and committing yourself to lifelong learning. Drawing on extensive multidisciplinary research, Hess and Ludwig emphasize that the key to success in this new era is not to be more like the machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human.</p>

                    WASHINGTON POST BESTSELLER Winner of the getAbstract 17th International Book Award &#8220;The Seventh Sense is a concept every businessman, diplomat, or student should aspire to master&#8211;a powerful idea, backed by stories and figures that will be impossible to forget.&#8221; &#8212; Walter Isaacson, author of Steve Jobs and Leonardo da Vinci Endless terror. Refugee waves. An unfixable global economy. Surprising election results. New billion-dollar fortunes. Miracle medical advances. What if they were all connected? What if you could understand why?  The Seventh Sense is the story of what all of today&#8217;s successful figures see and feel: the forces that are invisible to most of us but explain everything from explosive technological change to uneasy political ripples. The secret to power now is understanding our new age of networks. Not merely the Internet, but also webs of trade, finance, and even DNA. Based on his years of advising generals, CEOs, and politicians, Ramo takes us into the opaque heart of our world&#8217;s rapidly connected systems and teaches us what the losers are not yet seeing&#8211;and what the victors of this age already know.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;ve seen it all before. A malicious online rumor costs a company millions. A  political sideshow derails the national news cycle and destroys a candidate.  Some product or celebrity zooms from total obscurity to viral sensation. What  you don&#8217;t know is that someone is responsible for all this. Usually, someone  like me.    </p>
<p>                    I&#8217;m a media manipulator. In a world where blogs control and  distort the news, my job is to control blogs-as much as any one person  can.    </p>
<p>                    IN TODAY&#8217;S CULTURE&#8230;  Blogs like Gawker, BuzzFeed, and The Huffington Post drive the media agenda.   Bloggers are slaves to money, technology, and deadlines.  Manipulators wield these levers to shape everything you read, see, and hear-  online and off.Why am I giving away these secrets? Because I&#8217;m tired  of a world where blogs take indirect bribes, marketers help write the news,  reckless journalists spread lies, and no one is accountable for any of it. I&#8217;m  going to explain exactly how the media really works. What you choose to do with  this information is up to you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the Canadian National Business Book Award 2016<br />
                    Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award 2015    </p>
<p>                    In 2009, BlackBerry controlled half of the US smartphone market. Today that number is less than one per cent. What went so wrong?    </p>
<p>                    Losing the Signal is the riveting story of a company that toppled global giants before succumbing to the ruthlessly competitive forces of Silicon Valley. This is not a conventional tale of modern business failure by fraud and greed; instead, the rise and fall of BlackBerry reveals the dangerous speed at which innovators race along the information superhighway.    </p>
<p>                    With unprecedented access to key players, senior executives, directors, and competitors, Losing the Signal unveils the remarkable rise of a company that started above a bagel store in a small Canadian city and went on to control half of the US smartphone market. However, at the very moment BlackBerry was ranked the world&#8217;s fastest-growing company, internal feuds and chaotic growth crippled the company as it faced its gravest test: the entry of Apple and Google into the mobile phone market.    </p>
<p>                    Expertly told by acclaimed journalists Jacquie McNish and Sean Silcoff, this is an entertaining, whirlwind narrative that goes behind the scenes to reveal one of the most compelling business stories of the new century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Based on unprecedented access to the corporation&#8217;s archives, The Intel Trinity is the first full history of Intel Corporation-the essential company of the digital age- told through the lives of the three most important figures in the company&#8217;s history: Robert Noyce, Gordon Moore, and Andy Grove.  Often hailed the &#8220;most important company in the world,&#8221; Intel remains, more than four decades after its inception, a defining company of the global digital economy. The legendary inventors of the microprocessor-the single most important product in the modern world-Intel today builds the tiny &#8220;engines&#8221; that power almost every intelligent electronic device on the planet.  But the true story of Intel is the human story of the trio of geniuses behind it. Michael S. Malone reveals how each brought different things to Intel, and at different times. Noyce, the most respected high tech figure of his generation, brought credibility (and money) to the company&#8217;s founding; Moore made Intel the world&#8217;s technological leader; and Grove, has relentlessly driven the company to ever-higher levels of success and competitiveness.<br />
                    Without any one of these figures, Intel would never have achieved its historic success; with them, Intel made possible the personal computer, Internet, telecommunications, and the personal electronics revolutions.  The Intel Trinity is not just the story of Intel&#8217;s legendary past; it also offers an analysis of the formidable challenges that lie ahead as the company struggles to maintain its dominance, its culture, and its legacy.  With eight pages of black-and-white photos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES, USA TODAY, AND WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Kai-Fu Lee believes China will be the next tech-innovation superpower and in AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, he explains why. Taiwan-born Lee is perfectly positioned for the task.&#8221;-New York Magazine     </p>
<p>                    In this thought-provoking book, Lee argues powerfully that because of the unprecedented developments in AI, dramatic changes will be happening much sooner than many of us expected. Indeed, as the US-Sino AI competition begins to heat up, Lee urges the US and China to both accept and to embrace the great responsibilities that come with significant technological power.     </p>
<p>                    Most experts already say that AI will have a devastating impact on blue-collar jobs. But Lee predicts that Chinese and American AI will have a strong impact on white-collar jobs as well. Is universal basic income the solution? In Lee&#8217;s opinion, probably not. But he provides a clear description of which jobs will be affected and how soon, which jobs can be enhanced with AI, and most importantly, how we can provide solutions to some of the most profound changes in the future of human history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Starting a new venture is like jumping off a cliff and sewing a parachute on the way down. This book is the parachute.&#8221;<br />
                     Joe Gebbia, cofounder and chief product officer, Airbnb    </p>
<p>                    How do you make your start-up a genuine success in the long term?  While most books and press focus on the more sensational moments of creation and conclusion, The Messy Middle argues that the real key to success is how you navigate the ups-and-downs after initial investment is secured. It will give you all the insights you need to build and optimize your team, improve your product and develop your own capacity to lead covering:<br />
                    *         Coping with uncertainty and conflict<br />
                    *         Playing the long game<br />
                    *         Optimising your team<br />
                    *         Problem solving through the ups and downs<br />
                    *         Adapting your strategy<br />
                    *         When to quit<br />
                    Building on seven years&#8217; of meticulous research with entrepreneurs, small agencies, start-ups and billion-dollar companies, Scott Belsky offers indispensable lessons on how to endure and thrive in the long term.</p>

<p>                    Every year, thousands of visitors come from around the world to visit Menlo Innovations, a small software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They make the trek not to learn about technology but to witness a radically different approach to company culture.     </p>
<p>                    CEO Rich Sheridan removed the fear and ambiguity that typically make a workplace miserable. With joy as the explicit goal, he and his team changed everything about how the company was run. The results blew away all expectations. Menlo has won numerous growth awards and was named an Inc. magazine &#8220;audacious small company.&#8221;     </p>
<p>                    Joy, Inc. offers an inside look at how Menlo created its culture, and shows how any organization can follow their methods for a more passionate team and sustainable, profitable results.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now available in paperback-with a new preface and interview with Jessica Livingston about Y Combinator!    </p>
<p>                     Founders at Work: Stories of Startups&#8217; Early Days is a collection of interviews with founders of famous technology companies about what happened in the very earliest days. These people are celebrities now. What was it like when they were just a couple friends with an idea? Founders like Steve Wozniak (Apple), Caterina Fake (Flickr), Mitch Kapor (Lotus), Max Levchin (PayPal), and Sabeer Bhatia (Hotmail) tell you in their own words about their surprising and often very funny discoveries as they learned how to build a company.    </p>
<p>                     Where did they get the ideas that made them rich? How did they convince investors to back them? What went wrong, and how did they recover?    </p>
<p>                     Nearly all technical people have thought of one day starting or working for a startup. For them, this book is the closest you can come to being a fly on the wall at a successful startup, to learn how it&#8217;s done.    </p>
<p>                     But ultimately these interviews are required reading for anyone who wants to understand business, because startups are business reduced to its essence. The reason their founders become rich is that startups do what businesses do-create value-more intensively than almost any other part of the economy. How? What are the secrets that make successful startups so insanely productive? Read this book, and let the founders themselves tell you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joan Didion at a startup&#8217; Rebecca Solnit    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;Impossibly pleasurable&#8217; Jia Tolentino    </p>
<p>                                &#8216;This is essential reading&#8217; Stylist    </p>
<p>                              At twenty-five years old, Anna Wiener was beginning to tire of her assistant job in New York publishing. There was no room to grow, and the voyeuristic thrill of answering someone else&#8217;s phone had worn thin.    </p>
<p>                              Within a year she had moved to Silicon Valley to take up a job at a data analytics startup in San Francisco. Leaving her business casual skirts and shirts in the wardrobe, she began working in company-branded T-shirts. She had a healthy income for the first time in her life. She felt like part of the future.    </p>
<p>                              But a tide was beginning to turn. People were speaking of tech startups as surveillance companies. Out of sixty employees, only eight of her colleagues were women. Casual sexism was rife. Sexual harassment cases were proliferating. And soon, like everyone else, she was addicted to the internet, refreshing the news, refreshing social media, scrolling and scrolling and scrolling. Slowly, she began to realise that her blind faith in ambitious, arrogant young men from America&#8217;s soft suburbs wasn&#8217;t just her own personal pathology. It had become a global affliction.    </p>
<p>                              Uncanny Valley is a coming of age story set against the backdrop of our generation&#8217;s very own gold rush. It&#8217;s a story about the tension between old and new, between art and tech, between the quest for money and the quest for meaning &#8211; about how our world is changing forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The essential playbook for the future of your business What To Do When Machines Do Everything is a guidebook to succeeding in the next generation of the digital economy. When systems running on Artificial Intelligence can drive our cars, diagnose medical patients, and manage our finances more effectively than humans it raises profound questions on the future of work and how companies compete. Illustrated with real-world cases, data, and insight, the authors provide clear strategic guidance and actionable steps to help you and your organization move ahead in a world where exponentially developing new technologies are changing how value is created. Written by a team of business and technology expert practitioners who also authored Code Halos: How the Digital Lives of People, Things, and Organizations are Changing the Rules of Business this book provides a clear path to the future of your work. The first part of the book examines the once in a generation upheaval most every organization will soon face as systems of intelligence go mainstream.<br />
                    The authors argue that contrary to the doom and gloom that surrounds much of IT and business at the moment, we are in fact on the cusp of the biggest wave of opportunity creation since the Industrial Revolution. Next, the authors detail a clear-cut business model to help leaders take part in this coming boom; the AHEAD model outlines five strategic initiatives Automate, Halos, Enhance, Abundance, and Discovery that are central to competing in the next phase of global business by driving new levels of efficiency, customer intimacy and innovation. Business leaders today have two options: be swallowed up by the ongoing technological evolution, or ride the crest of the wave to new profits and better business. This book shows you how to avoid your own extinction event, and will help you; * Understand the untold full extent of technology&#8217;s impact on the way we work and live.<br />
                    * Find out where we&#8217;re headed, and how soon the future will arrive * Leverage the new emerging paradigm into a sustainable business advantage * Adopt a strategic model for winning in the new economy The digital world is already transforming how we work, live, and shop, how we are governed and entertained, and how we manage our money, health, security, and relationships. Don&#8217;t let your business or your career get left behind. What To Do When Machines Do Everything is your strategic roadmap to a future full of possibility and success. Or peril.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT&#038;T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it&#8217;s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn&#8217;t been touched by Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century&#8217;s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to create the most transformative meetings and moments    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Priya Parker has created both an art and a science to gathering in ways that can bring joy and fulfilment to any meeting&#8217; Deepak Chopra     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!&#8217; Chris Anderson, creator of TED    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     </p>
<p>                    Being deprived of gathering has revealed just how important it is to us; to connect with others, collaborate, share ideas and create moving, life-affirming experiences.    </p>
<p>                    At a time when coming together is more crucial than ever, Priya Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that can help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences in their lives, large and small, for work and for play.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her wide expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings &#8211; a court hearing, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp &#8211; and explains how simple changes can invigorate any group experience.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    WINNER OF THE 2020 NAACP IMAGE AWARD FOR OUTSTANDING LITERARY WORK &#8211; BIOGRAPHY/AUTOBIOGRAPHY    </p>
<p>                    In this part-manifesto, part-memoir, the revolutionary editor who infused social consciousness into the pages of Teen Vogue explores what it means to come into your own &#8211; on your own terms.    </p>
<p>                    Elaine Welteroth has climbed the ranks of media and fashion,  shattering ceilings along the way. In this riveting and timely memoir,  the groundbreaking editor unpacks lessons on race, identity, and  success through her own journey, from navigating her way as the  unstoppable child of a unlikely interracial marriage in small-town  California to finding herself on the frontlines of a modern movement for  the next generation of change makers.     </p>
<p>                    Welteroth moves beyond  the headlines and highlight reels to share the profound lessons and  struggles of being a barrier-breaker across so many intersections. As a  young boss and the only black woman in the room, she&#8217;s had enough of the  world telling her &#8211; and all women &#8211; they&#8217;re not enough. As she learns to  rely on herself by looking both inward and upward, we&#8217;re ultimately  reminded that we&#8217;re more than enough.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You won&#8217;t find a more honest, raw and helpful look into the trenches of founding a tech startup than this book&#8217; Nir Eyal, author of Hooked    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Rand Fishkin is the real deal&#8217; Seth Godin, entrepreneur and author     </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    Everyone knows how a startup story is supposed to go: a young, brilliant entrepreneur has an cool idea, drops out of college, defies the doubters, overcomes all odds, makes billions and becomes the envy of the technology world.     </p>
<p>                    This is not that story.    </p>
<p>                    Rand Fishkin, the founder and former CEO of Moz, is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on SEO. Moz is now a $45 million a year business, but Fishkin&#8217;s business and reputation took 15 years to grow, and his startup began not in a Harvard dorm room but as a mother-and-son family business that fell deeply into debt.     </p>
<p>                    Now Fishkin pulls back the curtain on tech startup mythology, exposing the ups and downs of startup life that most CEOs would rather keep secret. For instance: a minimally viable product can be destructive if you launch at the wrong moment. Growth hacking may be the buzzword du jour, but initiatives to your business can fizzle quickly. Revenue and profitability won&#8217;t protect you from layoffs. And venture capital always comes with strings attached.     </p>
<p>                    In Lost and Founder Fishkin reveals the mostly awful, sometimes awesome truth about startup culture with the transparency and humour that his hundreds of thousands of blog readers have come to love. Fishkin&#8217;s hard-won lessons are applicable to any kind of business environment and this book can help solve your problems, and make you feel less alone for having them.    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is a truly courageous book. It&#8217;s one part business-building guide and two parts Indiana Jones-style adventure memoir&#8217; Chris Guillebeau, author of Side Hustle and The $100 Startup    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Rand Fishkin is like the industry friend we all wish we had &#8211; funny, warm, and refreshingly honest about the rollercoaster ride that is founding your own company&#8217; Julie Zhou, VP of Product Design at Facebook</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Segall put the &#8216;i&#8217; in iPad. Now he explains why simplicity is the secret of Apple&#8217;s success in Insanely Simple.    </p>
<p>                    To Steve Jobs, Simplicity wasn&#8217;t just a design principle. It was a religion and a weapon. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. It&#8217;s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011, and guides the way Apple is organized, how it designs products, and how it connects with customers. It&#8217;s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.    </p>
<p>                    As creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple&#8217;s resurrection, helping to create such critical campaigns as &#8216;Think Different&#8217; and naming the iMac. Insanely Simple is his insider&#8217;s view of Jobs&#8217; world. It reveals the ten elements of Simplicity that have driven Apple&#8217;s success &#8211; which you can use to propel your own organisation. Reading Insanely Simple, you&#8217;ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You&#8217;ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A blueprint for running a company the Steve Jobs way &#8230; should be required reading for anyone interested in management and marketing&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Punchy &#8230; Segall gets inside Apple&#8217;s branding and marketing to explain its directness and power&#8217;  Financial Times     </p>
<p>                    Ken Segall worked closely with Steve Jobs as ad agency creative director for NeXT and Apple. He was a member of the team that created Apple&#8217;s legendary &#8216;Think Different&#8217; campaign, and he&#8217;s responsible for that little &#8220;i&#8221; that&#8217;s a part of Apple&#8217;s most popular products. Segall has also served as creative director for IBM, Intel, Dell, and BMW. He blogs about technology and marketing at kensegall.com/blog, and has fun with it all at scoopertino.com.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;necessary and incisive&#8221; (Roxane Gay) account of the discrimination case that &#8220;has blown open a conversation about the status of women&#8221; in the workplace (The New York Times) SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 FINANCIAL TIMES AND MCKINSEY BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR &#8211; NAMED A BEST FALL BOOK BY ELLE AND BUSTLE  In 2015, Ellen K. Pao sued a powerhouse Silicon Valley venture capital firm, calling out workplace discrimination and retaliation against women and other underrepresented groups. Her suit rocked the tech world&#8211;and exposed its toxic culture and its homogeneity. Her message overcame negative PR attacks that took aim at her professional conduct and her personal life, and she won widespread public support&#8211;Time hailed her as &#8220;the face of change.&#8221; Though Pao lost her suit, she revolutionized the conversation at tech offices, in the media, and around the world. In Reset,  she tells her full story for the first time.  The daughter of immigrants, Pao was taught that through hard work she could achieve her dreams. She earned multiple Ivy League degrees, worked at top startups, and in 2005 was recruited by Kleiner Perkins, arguably the world&#8217;s leading venture capital firm at the time. In many ways, she did everything right, and yet she and other women and people of color were excluded from success&#8211;cut out of decisive meetings and email discussions, uninvited to CEO dinners and lavish networking trips, and had their work undercut or appropriated by male executives. It was time for a system reset.  After Kleiner, Pao became CEO of reddit, where she took forceful action to change the status quo for the company and its product. She banned revenge porn and unauthorized nude photos&#8211;an action other large media sites later followed&#8211;and shut down parts of reddit over online harassment. She and seven other women tech leaders formed Project Include, an award-winning nonprofit for accelerating diversity and inclusion in tech. In her book, Pao shines a light on troubling issues that plague today&#8217;s workplace and lays out practical, inspiring, and achievable goals for a better future.  Ellen K. Pao&#8217;s Reset is a rallying cry&#8211;the story of a whistleblower who aims to empower everyone struggling to be heard, in Silicon Valley and beyond. Praise for Reset &#8220;Necessary and incisive . . . As Ellen Pao detailed her experiences, while also communicating her passion for the work men often impeded her from doing, I was nothing short of infuriated. It was great to see a highly accomplished woman of color speaking out like this, and hopefully this book will encourage more women to come forward, give voice to their experiences in the workplace, and contribute to meaningful change.&#8221;&#8211;Roxane Gay</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2016, one of the giants of modern journalism fell: Gawker Media, infamous for saying what other outlets wouldn&#8217;t say, was sued for publishing Hulk Hogan&#8217;s sex tape, lost the case and went bust. After countless other lawsuits it seemed that Gawker had finally run out of luck. But luck had nothing to do with it.     </p>
<p>                    Peter Thiel, PayPal founder and billionaire investor, had masterminded the whole thing. Still furious at an article that had outed him ten years previously, and increasingly disgusted at Gawker&#8217;s unscrupulous reporting methods, Thiel had spent nearly a decade meticulously plotting a conspiracy that would lead to the demise of Gawker and its founder, Nick Denton. After a multi-year proxy war through the Florida legal system, the settlement of $140million in favour of Hogan ended it.    </p>
<p>                    The verdict would stun the world and so would Peter&#8217;s ultimate unmasking as the man who had set it all in motion. Why had he done this? How had no one discovered it? What would this mean&#8211;for free speech? For privacy? For culture?    </p>
<p>                    In Holiday&#8217;s masterful telling of this nearly unbelievable conspiracy, informed by exclusive interviews with all the key players, this case transcends the narrative of how one billionaire took down a media empire or the current state of the free press. It&#8217;s a study in power, strategy, and one of the most wildly ambitious &#8211; and successful &#8211; secret plots in recent memory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestseller and winner of a 2015 Prose Award!<br />
                    There is a threat lurking online. A secret war with the power to destroy your finances, steal your personal data, and endanger your life.<br />
                    In Spam Nation, investigative journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs unmasks the criminal masterminds driving some of the biggest spam and hacker operations targeting Americans and their bank accounts. Tracing the rise, fall, and alarming resurrection of the digital mafia behind the two largest spam pharmacies-and countless viruses, phishing, and spyware attacks-he delivers the first definitive narrative of the global spam problem and its threat to consumers everywhere.<br />
                    Blending cutting-edge research, investigative reporting, and firsthand interviews, this terrifying true story reveals how we unwittingly invite these digital thieves into our lives every day. From unassuming computer programmers right next door to digital mobsters like &#8220;Cosma&#8221;-who unleashed a massive malware attack that has stolen thousands of Americans&#8217; logins and passwords-Krebs uncovers the shocking lengths to which these people will go to profit from our data and our wallets.<br />
                    Not only are hundreds of thousands of Americans exposing themselves to fraud and dangerously toxic products from rogue online pharmacies, but even those who never open junk messages are at risk. As Krebs notes, spammers can-and do-hack into accounts through these emails, harvest personal information like usernames and passwords, and sell them on the digital black market.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In less than a decade, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Andy Grove founded three companies that would define the world of technology and transform our lives. At their peaks, Microsoft, Apple, and Intel were collectively worth some $1.5 trillion. Strategy Rules examines these three individuals collectively for the first time &#8211; their successes and failures, commonalities and differences &#8211; revealing the business strategies and practices they pioneered while building their firms. David B. Yoffie and Michael A. Cusumano have studied these three leaders and their companies for more than thirty years, while teaching business strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship at Harvard and MIT. In this enlightening guide, they show how Gates, Grove, and Jobs approached strategy and execution in remarkably similar ways &#8211; yet markedly differently from their erstwhile competitors &#8211; keeping their focus on five strategic rules. Strategy Rules brings together the best practices in strategic management and high-tech entrepreneurship from three path-breaking entrepreneurs who emerged as CEOs of huge global companies.<br />
                    Their approaches to formulating strategy and building organizations offer unique insights for start-up executives as well as the heads of modern multinationals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An engrossing, insider&#8217;s account of how a teacher built one of the world&#8217;s most valuable companies-rivaling Walmart and Amazon-and forever reshaped the global economy  In just a decade and a half, Jack Ma, a man from modest beginnings who started out as an English teacher, founded Alibaba and built it into one of the world&#8217;s largest companies, an e-commerce empire on which hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers depend. In 2014, Alibaba&#8217;s $25 billion IPO was the largest global IPO in history. A Rockefeller of his time, who is courted by CEOs and presidents around the world, Jack is an icon for China&#8217;s booming private sector and the gatekeeper to hundreds of millions of middle-class consumers. Duncan Clark first met Jack in 1999 in the small apartment where Jack founded Alibaba. Granted unprecedented access to a wealth of new material, including exclusive interviews, Clark draws on his own experience as an early adviser to Alibaba as well as his two decades in China chronicling the Internet&#8217;s impact on the country to create an authoritative, compelling narrative account of Alibaba&#8217;s rise.<br />
                    How did Jack overcome his humble origins and early failures to achieve massive success with Alibaba? How did he outsmart rival entrepreneurs from both China and Silicon Valley? Can Alibaba maintain its 80 percent market share? As it forges ahead into finance and entertainment, are there limits to Alibaba&#8217;s ambitions? How does the Chinese government view its rise? Will Alibaba expand farther overseas, including into the United States?  Clark tells Alibaba&#8217;s tale in the context of China&#8217;s momentous economic and social changes, illuminating an unlikely corporate titan as never before.  Advance Praise For Alibaba  &#8220;Anybody who thinks the Chinese just copy or steal technology from the West should read this book and think again. Jack Ma is part Bill Gates, part Steve Jobs, part Larry Page, part Sergey Brin, and part Mark Zuckerberg, all rolled into one.&#8221;-Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP &#8220;Duncan Clark gets into the heart and soul of Alibaba and its founder, Jack Ma, who deftly maneuvered through the discontinuities and barriers in China to create one of the greatest companies in the world. China has thrived under the leadership of Jack Ma.<br />
                    This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand the present China and the heartbeat of a great entrepreneur.&#8221;-Tim Draper, founder of Draper Associates, DFJ, and Draper University  &#8220;This book provides excellent insight into the world of Jack Ma, perhaps the most famous of the leaders of the new economy in China. Duncan Clark is a real China &#8216;Old Hand,&#8217; unique in his knowledge of the Jack Ma generation. This book is definitely on the short list for those who wish to understand the Chinese economy today.&#8221;-Ken Wilcox, Chairman Emeritus, Silicon Valley Bank</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dan Lyons was Technology Editor at Newsweek Magazine for years, a magazine writer at the top of his profession. One Friday morning he received a phone call: his job no longer existed. Fifty years old and with a wife and two young kids, Dan was unemployed and facing financial oblivion. Then an idea hit. Dan had long reported on Silicon Valley and the tech explosion. Why not join it? HubSpot, a Boston start-up, was flush with $100 million in venture capital. They offered Dan a pile of stock options for the nebulous role of &#8220;marketing fellow.&#8221; What could possibly go wrong?     </p>
<p>                     What follows is a hilarious and excoriating account of Dan&#8217;s time at the start-up and a revealing window onto the dysfunctional culture that prevails in a world flush with cash and devoid of experience. Filled with stories of meaningless jargon, teddy bears at meetings, push-up competitions and all-night parties, this uproarious tale is also a trenchant analysis of the dysfunctional start-up world, a de facto conspiracy between those who start companies and those who fund them. It is a world where bad ideas are rewarded with hefty investments, where companies blow money lavishing perks on their post-collegiate workforces, and where everybody is trying to hang on just long enough to cash out with a fortune.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*THE INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER AND WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM BOOK CLUB PICK*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A clear, compelling guide to some of the most pressing debates in technology today.&#8217; Bill Gates    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A colourful and insightful insiders&#8217; view of how technology is both empowering us and threatening us. From privacy to cyberattacks, this timely book is a useful guide for how to navigate the digital future.&#8217;  Walter Isaacson, bestselling author of Steve Jobs    </p>
<p>                    From Microsoft&#8217;s President and one of the tech industry&#8217;s wisest thinkers, a frank and thoughtful reckoning with how to balance enormous promise and existential risk as the digitization of everything accelerates. With new chapters on the pandemic and beyond.<br />
                    __________    </p>
<p>                    Microsoft President Brad Smith operates by a simple core belief: when your technology changes the world, you bear a responsibility to help address the world you have helped create.     </p>
<p>                    This might seem uncontroversial, but it flies in the face of a tech sector long obsessed with rapid growth and sometimes on disruption as an end in itself. While sweeping digital transformation holds great promise, we have reached an inflection point. The world has turned information technology into both a powerful tool and a formidable weapon, and new approaches are needed to manage an era defined by even more powerful inventions like artificial intelligence. Companies that create technology must accept greater responsibility for the future, and governments will need to regulate technology by moving faster and catching up with the pace of innovation.    </p>
<p>                    In Tools and Weapons, Brad Smith and Carol Ann Browne bring us a captivating narrative from the cockpit of one of the world&#8217;s largest and most powerful tech companies as it finds itself in the middle of some of the thorniest emerging issues of our time. These are challenges that come with no pre-existing playbook, including privacy, cybercrime and cyberwar, social media, the moral conundrums of artificial intelligence, big tech&#8217;s relationship to inequality, and the challenges for democracy, far and near. While in no way a self-glorifying &#8220;Microsoft memoir,&#8221; the book pulls back the curtain remarkably wide onto some of the company&#8217;s most crucial recent decision points as it strives to protect the hopes technology offers against the very real threats it also presents. There are huge ramifications for communities and countries, and Brad Smith provides a thoughtful and urgent contribution to that effort.    </p>
<p>                    __________    </p>
<p>                    In Tools and Weapons, Brad Smith takes us behind the scenes on some of the biggest stories to hit the tech industry in the past decade and some of the biggest threats we face. From Edward Snowden&#8217;s NSA leak to the NHS WannaCry ransomware attack, this book is essential reading to understand what&#8217;s happening in the world around us.    </p>
<p>                    Praise for Tools and Weapons:     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large.&#8217; The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;In Tools and Weapons, Brad and Carol Ann Browne wrestle with some of the world&#8217;s toughest technology challenges with common sense and valuable insight reflecting their inside experience. The ideas in Tools and Weapons won&#8217;t solve all our problems, but they&#8217;re a very good place to start.&#8217; &#8211; Reed Hastings, CEO, Netflix    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Tools and Weapons is a glimpse behind the curtain as Microsoft reckoned with the Snowden revelations, defended against the vicious cyberattacks, and took both the Obama and Trump administrations to court.&#8217; &#8211; Rolling Stone</p>

Built with a seemingly permanent culture of reinvention, Silicon Valley does not fight change; it embraces it, and now powers the American economy and global innovation.    </p>
<p>                    So how did this omnipotent and ever-morphing place come to be? It was not by planning. It was, like many an empire before it, part luck, part timing, and part ambition. And part pure, unbridled genius&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on over two hundred in-depth interviews, VALLEY OF GENIUS takes readers from the dawn of the personal computer and the internet, through the heyday of the web, up to the very moment when our current technological reality was invented. The book interweaves stories of invention and betrayal, overnight success and underground exploits, to tell the story of Silicon Valley like it has never been told before. These are the stories that Valley insiders tell each other: the tall tales that are all, improbably, true.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An indispensable guide.&#8217; Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Tech&#8217;s most valuable teacher.&#8217; Forbes    </p>
<p>                    Silicon Valley&#8217;s leading intellectual and the founder of O&#8217;Reilly Media explores the upside and the potential downsides of our future &#8211; what he calls the &#8216;next economy&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                    Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s genius is to identify and explain emerging technologies with world shaking potential &#8211; the World Wide Web, Open Source Software, Web 2.0, Open Government data, the Maker Movement, Big Data. &#8216;The man who can really can make a whole industry happen,&#8217; according to Executive Chairman of Google Eric Schmidt, O&#8217;Reilly has most recently focused on the future of work &#8211; AI, algorithms, and new approaches to business organisation that will shape our lives. He has brought together an unlikely coalition of technologists, business leaders, labour advocates, and policy makers to wrestle with these issues. In WTF? he shares the evolution of his intellectual development, applying his approach to a number of challenging issues we will face as citizens, employees, business leaders, and a nation.    </p>
<p>                    What is the future when an increasing number of jobs can be performed by intelligent machines instead of people, or only done by people in partnership with those machines? What happens to our consumer based societies &#8211; to workers and to the companies that depend on their purchasing power? Is income inequality and unemployment an inevitable consequence of technological advancement, or are there paths to a better future? What will happen to business when technology-enabled networks and marketplaces are better at deploying talent than traditional companies? What&#8217;s the future of education when on-demand learning outperforms traditional institutions? Will the fundamental social safety nets of the developed world survive the transition, and if not, what will replace them?    </p>
<p>                    The digital revolution has transformed the world of media, upending centuries-old companies and business models. Now, it is restructuring every business, every job, and every sector of society. Yet the biggest changes are still ahead. To survive, every industry and organisation will have to transform itself in multiple ways. O&#8217;Reilly explores what the next economy will mean for the world and every aspect of our lives &#8211; and what we can do to shape it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A refreshing approach to entrepreneurship centered on staying small and avoiding growth &#8211; maximizing happiness, sustainability and profitability.    </p>
<p>                    Paul Jarvis left the corporate world when he realized that working in a high-pressure, high-profile world was not his idea of success. Instead, he now works for himself out of his home, and lives a much more rewarding and productive life. He no longer has to contend with an environment that constantly demands more productivity, more output and more growth.    </p>
<p>                    In Company of One, Jarvis explains how you can do the same, including:    </p>
<p>                    *         Planning to set up<br />
                    *         Determining desired revenues<br />
                    *         Keeping clients happy<br />
                    *         And, of course, doing all this on your own.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Jarvis makes a compelling case for making your business better instead of bigger. A must-read for any entrepreneur who prioritizes a rich life over riches.&#8221;<br />
                     -CAL NEWPORT, bestselling author of DEEP WORK and DIGITAL MINIMALISM    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;You&#8217;re not a machine, so why would you run your business like one? Company of One shows you another way. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how to have a business that works for you-instead of the other way around-you need this book.&#8221;<br />
                    -CHRIS GUILLEBEAU, bestselling author of SIDE HUSTLE and THE $100 STARTUP</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A page-turning warts-and-all narrative about Marissa Mayer&#8217;s efforts to remake Yahoo as well as her own rise from Stanford University undergrad to CEO of a $30 billion corporation by the age of thirty-eight.    </p>
<p>                    When Yahoo hired star Google executive Marissa Mayer to be its CEO in 2012, employees rejoiced. They put posters on the walls throughout Yahoo&#8217;s California headquarters. On them was Mayer&#8217;s face and one word: hope.    </p>
<p>                    Just over a year later-on November 4, 2013-Mayer sat in front of those same employees in a huge cafeteria on Yahoo&#8217;s campus and took the beating of her life. Her hair wet and her tone defensive, Mayer read and answered a series of employee-posed questions challenging the basic elements of her plan. There was anger in the room; and behind it, a question: Was Mayer actually going to be able to do this thing?    </p>
<p>                    Nicholas Carlson&#8217;s fast-paced narrative is the inside story of Mayer&#8217;s controversial rise at Google, her desperate fight to save an Internet icon, and how Yahoo got into such awful shape in the first place.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A gripping read&#8217; Adam Grant, bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    Reddit hails itself as &#8216;the front page of the Internet&#8217;. It&#8217;s the sixth most-visited website in the world &#8211; and yet, millions have no idea what it is. They should be paying attention.    </p>
<p>                    This definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit is perfect for readers of The Everything Store, Googled and The Facebook Effect.    </p>
<p>                    We Are the Nerds takes readers inside this captivating, maddening enterprise, whose army of obsessed users have been credited with everything from solving crimes and spurring millions in charitable donations to seeding alt-right fury and even landing Donald Trump in the White House. Reddit has become a mirror of the Internet itself: It has dark trenches, shiny memes, malicious trolls, and a heart-warming ability to connect people across cultures, oceans, and ideological divides.    </p>
<p>                    This is the gripping story of how Reddit&#8217;s founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, transformed themselves from student video-gamers into Silicon Valley millionaires as they turned their creation into an icon of the digital age. But the journey was often fraught. Reporting on Reddit for more than six years, conducting hundreds of interviews and gaining exclusive access to its founders, Christine Lagorio-Chafkin has written the definitive account of the birth and life of Reddit. Packed with revelatory details about its biggest triumphs and controversies, this inside look at Reddit includes fresh insights on the relationship between Huffman and Ohanian, staff turmoil, the tragic life of Aaron Swartz, and Reddit&#8217;s struggle to become profitable.    </p>
<p>                    In a time when we are increasingly concerned about privacy and manipulation on social platforms, We Are the Nerds reveals Reddit&#8217;s central role in the dissemination of culture and information in history&#8217;s first fully digital century. Rigorously reported and highly entertaining, We Are the Nerds explores how this unique platform has changed the way we all communicate today.    </p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR THE BOOK:    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Incisive, witty and brilliantly written&#8217; &#8211; Emily Chang, bestselling author of Brotopia    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A triumph &#8211; a business book that reads like a page-turning novel&#8217; &#8211; James Ledbetter, author of One Nation Under Gold    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The best, grittiest, most accurate book yet about what it&#8217;s like to build a startup and a community from scratch&#8217; &#8211; John Zeratsky, bestselling author of Sprint and Make Time    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A gripping, entertaining book that is a must-read for every entrepreneur&#8217; &#8211; Daymond John, bestselling author of Rise and Grind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Too many books on tech feel like they have been Googled together; Lagorio-Chafkin&#8217;s is rich in original reportage&#8217; &#8211; TLS</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    Edward Snowden, the man who risked everything to expose the US government&#8217;s system of mass surveillance, reveals for the first time the story of his life, including how he helped to build that system and what motivated him to try to bring it down.    </p>
<p>                    In 2013, twenty-nine-year-old Edward Snowden shocked the world when he broke with the American intelligence establishment and revealed that the United States government was secretly pursuing the means to collect every single phone call, text message, and email. The result would be an unprecedented system of mass surveillance with the ability to pry into the private lives of every person on earth. Six years later, Snowden reveals for the very first time how he helped to build this system and why he was moved to expose it.    </p>
<p>                    Spanning the bucolic Beltway suburbs of his childhood and the clandestine CIA and NSA postings of his adulthood, Permanent Record is the extraordinary account of a bright young man who grew up online &#8211; a man who became a spy, a whistleblower, and, in exile, the Internet&#8217;s conscience. Written with wit, grace, passion, and an unflinching candor, Permanent Record is a crucial memoir of our digital age and destined to be a classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES AND #1 INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER &#8211; with a new foreword by Silicon Valley legend Marc Andreessen.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;For my money, a better book about Jobs than Walter Isaacson&#8217;s biography&#8217; New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A fascinating reinterpretation of the Steve Jobs story&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    We all think we know who Steve Jobs was, what made him tick, and what made him succeed.     </p>
<p>                    Yet the single most important question about him has never been answered.     </p>
<p>                    The young, impulsive, egotistical genius was ousted in the mid-80s from the company he founded, exiled from his own kingdom and cast into the wilderness. Yet he returned a decade later to transform the ailing Apple into the most successful company the world had ever seen.     </p>
<p>                    How did this reckless upstart transform himself into a visionary business leader?     </p>
<p>                    The first comprehensive study of Jobs&#8217; career following his dismissal from Apple, written with unparalleled access and insight, BECOMING STEVE JOBS offers a startling new portrait of the most important business figure in modern history. The most intimate biography yet of Jobs, written by the journalist who knew him better than any other, BECOMING STEVE JOBS draws on recently discovered interviews that have never before seen the light of day, and answers for the first time the most pressing questions about what made this legendary business leader such a success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instant National Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    A PBS NewsHour-New York Times Book Club Pick!     </p>
<p>                    Excellent. &#8211;San Francisco Chronicle     </p>
<p>                    Brotopia is more than a business book. Silicon Valley holds extraordinary power over our present lives as well as whatever utopia (or nightmare) might come next. &#8211;New York Times     </p>
<p>                    Silicon Valley is a modern utopia where anyone can change the world. Unless you&#8217;re a woman.     </p>
<p>                    For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops, where millions of dollars grow on trees. It&#8217;s a Brotopia, where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.     </p>
<p>                    In this powerful exposé, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don&#8217;t Be Evil! Connect the World!)&#8211;and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao&#8217;s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they won&#8217;t lower their standards just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer&#8211;who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman&#8211;reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.     </p>
<p>                    Silicon Valley&#8217;s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It&#8217;s time to break up the boys&#8217; club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture&#8211;to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This &#8220;brilliant and provocative&#8221; (Walter Isaacson) guide shares nine principles to adapt and survive the technological changes shaping our future from the director of the MIT Media Lab and a veteran Wired journalist.  The world is more complex and volatile today than at any other time in our history. The tools of our modern existence are getting faster, cheaper, and smaller at an exponential rate, transforming every aspect of society, from business to culture and from the public sphere to our most private moments. The people who succeed will be the ones who learn to think differently.  In Whiplash, Joi Ito and Jeff Howe distill that logic into nine organizing principles for navigating and surviving this tumultuous period: Emergence over Authority Pull over Push Compasses over Maps Risk over Safety Disobedience over Compliance Practice over Theory Diversity over Ability Resilience over Strength Systems over Objects   Filled with incredible case studies and cutting-edge research and philosophies from the MIT Media Lab and beyond, Whiplash will help you adapt and succeed in this unpredictable world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this book, Klaus Schwab and the World Economic Forum contribute significantly to one of the most important issues of our time &#8211; how to move forward in the Fourth Industrial Revolution&#8217; Jack Ma, Executive Chairman, Alibaba Group Holding, People&#8217;s Republic of China    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s no secret that technologies are reshaping the world&#8217;s economies and societies. To manage the risks and spread the benefits, we have to act now, and in the interest of stakeholders everywhere&#8217; Andrew McAfee, Co-Founder, MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, MIT, USA    </p>
<p>                    We are on the brink of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. And this one will be unlike any other in human history.    </p>
<p>                    Characterized by new technologies fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, the Fourth Industrial Revolution will impact all disciplines, economies and industries &#8211; and it will do so at an unprecedented rate. World Economic Forum data predicts that by 2025 we will see: commercial use of nanomaterials 200 times stronger than steel and a million times thinner than human hair; the first transplant of a 3D-printed liver; 10% of all cars on US roads being driverless; and much more besides.    </p>
<p>                    In The Fourth Industrial Revolution, Schwab outlines the key technologies driving this revolution, discusses the major impacts on governments, businesses, civil society and individuals, and offers bold ideas for what can be done to shape a better future for all.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution are extraordinary. Leadership has to be equally extraordinary to manage the complexities of systemic change&#8217; Eric Schmidt, Technical Advisor, Alphabet, USA</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Macdonald zeros in on the slipperiness of factuality, offering an array of case studies from the worlds of history, commerce and &#8211; of course &#8211; politics.&#8217; New York Times     </p>
<p>                    True or false?  It&#8217;s rarely that simple.    </p>
<p>                    There is always more than one truth in every story.  Eating meat is nutritious but it&#8217;s also damaging to the environment.  The Internet disseminates knowledge but it also spreads hatred.  As communicators, we select the truths that are most useful to our agenda.    </p>
<p>                    We can select truths constructively to inspire nations, encourage children, and drive progressive change.  Or we can select truths that give a false impression of reality, misleading people without actually lying.  Others can do the same, motivating or deceiving us with the truth.      </p>
<p>                    In Truth, communications strategy expert Hector Macdonald explores how truth is used and abused in politics, business, the media and everyday life.   Combining great storytelling with practical takeaways and a litany of fascinating, funny and insightful case studies, Truth is a chilling and engaging read about how profoundly our mindsets and actions are influenced by the truths that those around us choose to tell.    </p>
<p>                    For fans of Factfulness, A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics and The Art of Thinking Clearly, a fascinating dive into the many ways in which &#8216;competing truths&#8217; shape our opinions, behaviours and beliefs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extraordinary innovations in technology promise to transform the world, but how realistic is the claim that AI will change our lives? In this much needed book the acclaimed economist Roger Bootle responds to the fascinating economic questions posed by the age of the robot, steering a path away from tech jargon and alarmism towards a rational explanation of the ways in which the AI revolution will affect us all. Tackling the implications of Artificial Intelligence on growth, productivity, inflation and the distribution of wealth and power, THE AI ECONOMY also examines coming changes to the the way we educate, work and spend our leisure time.    </p>
<p>                    A fundamentally optimistic view which will help you plan for changing times, this book explains AI and leads you towards a more certain future.</p>
