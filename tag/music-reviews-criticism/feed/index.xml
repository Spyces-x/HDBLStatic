										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Simply one of the best pieces of rock reportage ever written.&#8221; (Los Angeles Review of Books)    </p>
<p>                    As a pioneering rock journalist for Hit Parader, Vogue, Saturday Review, and other publications, Ellen Sander had a backstage pass to the hottest music scenes of the 1960s. In this feast of juicy anecdotes and keen social commentary, she draws upon her professional and personal experiences to chronicle pop culture&#8217;s highs and lows during the turbulent decade. Join her for weird and wild road trips with companions ranging from Yippies to the members of Led Zeppelin. Stops along the way include the folk-music clubs of Greenwich Village, Haight-Ashbury in its riotous heyday, and the euphoric festivals at Monterey and Woodstock.    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;It is a memoir, a sourcebook, and a love letter,&#8221; Sander writes, &#8220;a recollection of a time, parenthesized by ambivalence and apathy, a search for the ultimate high, a generation with an irrepressible vision, its art, artists, its audience, and the substance of its statement.&#8221; This expanded edition of Trips adds &#8220;The Plaster Casters of Chicago&#8221;, Sander&#8217;s seminal piece on groupie culture, the lengthy &#8220;Concerts and Conversations&#8221;, as well as a new preface and chapter postscripts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Legendary rock manager Simon Napier-Bell take you inside the (dodgy) world of popular music &#8211; not just a creative industry, but a business that has made people rich beyond their wildest dreams. He balances seductive anecdotes &#8211; pulling back the curtain on the gritty and absurd side of the industry &#8211; with an insightful exploration of the relationship between creativity and money. This book describes the evolution of the industry from 1713 &#8211; the year parliament granted writers ownership over what they wrote &#8211; to today, when a global, 100 billion pound industry is controlled by just three major players: Sony, Universal and Warner. Inside you will uncover some little-known facts about the industry, including:     </p>
<p>                    How a formula for writing hit songs in the 1900s helped create 50,000 of the best-known songs of all time<br />
                    How infighting in the American pre-war music industry shut down traditional radio and created an opening for country music, race records and rock&#8217;n&#8217;roll<br />
                    How Jewish immigrants and black jazz musicians dancing cheek-to-cheek created a template for all popular music that followed<br />
                    How rock tours became the biggest, quickest, sleaziest and most profitable ventures the music industry has ever seen<br />
                    After reading Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay, you&#8217;ll never listen to music in the same way again</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; A celebration of American history through the music that helped to shape a nation, by Pulitzer Prize winner Jon Meacham and music superstar Tim McGraw &#8220;Jon Meacham and Tim McGraw form an irresistible duo&#8211;connecting us to music as an unsung force in our nation&#8217;s history.&#8221;&#8211;Doris Kearns Goodwin  Through all the years of strife and triumph, America has been shaped not just by our elected leaders and our formal politics but also by our music&#8211;by the lyrics, performers, and instrumentals that have helped to carry us through the dark days and to celebrate the bright ones. From &#8220;The Star-Spangled Banner&#8221; to &#8220;Born in the U.S.A.,&#8221; Jon Meacham and Tim McGraw take readers on a moving and insightful journey through eras in American history and the songs and performers that inspired us. Meacham chronicles our history, exploring the stories behind the songs, and Tim McGraw reflects on them as an artist and performer. Their perspectives combine to create a unique view of the role music has played in uniting and shaping a nation.  Beginning with the battle hymns of the revolution, and taking us through songs from the defining events of the Civil War, the fight for women&#8217;s suffrage, the two world wars, the Great Depression, the civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, and into the twenty-first century, Meacham and McGraw explore the songs that defined generations, and the cultural and political climates that produced them. Readers will discover the power of music in the lives of figures such as Harriet Tubman, Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Martin Luther King, Jr., and will learn more about some of our most beloved musicians and performers, including Marian Anderson, Elvis Presley, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan, Duke Ellington, Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, and more. Songs of America explores both famous songs and lesser-known ones, expanding our understanding of the scope of American music and lending deeper meaning to the historical context of such songs as &#8220;My Country, &#8216;Tis of Thee,&#8221; &#8220;God Bless America,&#8221; &#8220;Over There,&#8221; &#8220;We Shall Overcome,&#8221; and &#8220;Blowin&#8217; in the Wind.&#8221; As Quincy Jones says, Meacham and McGraw have &#8220;convened a concert in Songs of America,&#8221; one that reminds us of who we are, where we&#8217;ve been, and what we, at our best, can be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this sweeping and dramatic narrative, Alex Ross, music critic for The New Yorker, weaves together the histories of the twentieth century and its music, from Vienna before the First World War to Paris in the twenties; from Hitler&#8217;s Germany and Stalin&#8217;s Russia to downtown New York in the sixties and seventies up to the present. Taking readers into the labyrinth of modern style, Ross draws revelatory connections between the century&#8217;s most influential composers and the wider culture. The Rest is Noise is an astonishing history of the twentieth century as told through its music.</p>
