										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is no simple set of instructions that can guarantee sanity, but if you want to overcome emotional difficulties and become happier, psychotherapist Philippa Perry, author of The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read, argues that there are four cornerstones to sanity you can influence to bring about change.     </p>
<p>                    By developing your self-observation skills, examining how you relate to others, breaking out of your comfort zone and exploring new ways of defining yourself, Philippa demonstrates that it is possible to become a little less tortured and a little more fulfilled. How to Stay Sane is at once a brilliant explanation of our minds and a profoundly useful guide to facing up to the many challenges life throws our way.    </p>
<p>                    Discover more inspirational guides from The School of Life series: How to Find Fulfilling Work, How to Worry Less About Money and How to Thrive in the Digital Age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An extraordinary book . . . It will shake up your most fundamental beliefs about everyday experience, and it just might change your life.&#8217; Paul Bloom<br />
                    ___    </p>
<p>                    For the millions of people who want spirituality without religion, Sam Harris&#8217;s new book is a guide to meditation as a rational spiritual practice informed by neuroscience and psychology.    </p>
<p>                     Throughout the book, Harris argues that there are important truths to be found in the experience of contemplatives such as Jesus, Buddha and other saints and sages of history-and, therefore, that there is more to understanding reality than science and secular culture generally allow.    </p>
<p>                    Waking Up is part seeker&#8217;s memoir and part exploration of the scientific underpinnings of spirituality. No other book marries contemplative wisdom and modern science in this way, and no author other than Sam Harris-a scientist, philosopher, and famous sceptic-could write it.<br />
                     ___    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A demanding, illusion-shattering book.&#8217; Kirkus Reviews<br />
                    &#8216;A pleasure to read.&#8217; Huffington Post</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hugely influential book on how the understanding of causality revolutionized science and the world, by the pioneer of artificial intelligence    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Wonderful &#8230; illuminating and fun to read&#8217; Daniel Kahneman, Nobel Prize-winner and author of Thinking, Fast and Slow    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Correlation  does not imply causation.&#8217; For decades, this mantra was invoked by scientists in order to avoid taking positions as to whether one thing  caused another, such as smoking and cancer, or carbon dioxide and global  warming. But today, that taboo is dead. The causal revolution, sparked  by world-renowned computer scientist Judea Pearl and his colleagues, has  cut through a century of confusion and placed cause and effect on a  firm scientific basis. Now, Pearl and science journalist Dana Mackenzie explain causal thinking to general readers for the first time, showing  how it allows us to explore the world that is and the worlds that could  have been. It is the essence of human and artificial intelligence. And  just as Pearl&#8217;s discoveries have enabled machines to think better, The  Book of Why explains how we too can think better.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Pearl&#8217;s accomplishments over the last 30 years have provided the theoretical basis for progress in artificial intelligence and have redefined the term &#8220;thinking machine&#8221;&#8216; Vint Cerf</p>

<p>                    &#8216;We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested.&#8217; DESMOND TUTU    </p>
<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the centuries since Descartes famously proclaimed, &#8216;I think, therefore I am,&#8217; science has often overlooked emotions as the source of a person&#8217;s true being. Even modern neuroscience has tended until recently to concentrate on the cognitive aspects of brain function, disregarding emotions. This attitude began to change with the publication of Descartes&#8217; Error. Antonio Damasio challenged traditional ideas about the connection between emotions and rationality. In this wonderfully engaging book, Damasio takes the reader on a journey of scientific discovery through a series of case studies, demonstrating what many of us have long suspected: emotions are not a luxury, they are essential to rational thinking and to normal social behaviour.</p>

<p>                    Nothing seems more real than the minds of other people. When you consider what your boss is thinking or whether your spouse is happy, you are admitting them into the &#8220;mind club.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to assume other humans can think and feel, but what about a cow, a computer, a corporation? What kinds of minds do they have?     </p>
<p>                    Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray are award-winning psychologists who have discovered that minds&#8211;while incredibly important&#8211;are a matter of perception. Their research opens a trove of new findings, with insights into human behavior that are fascinating, frightening, and funny. The Mind Club explains why we love some animals and eat others, why people debate the existence of God so intensely, how good people can be so cruel, and why robots make such poor lovers. By investigating the mind perception of extraordinary targets&#8211;animals, machines, comatose people, God&#8211;Wegner and Gray explain what it means to have a mind and why it matters so much.     </p>
<p>                    Fusing cutting-edge research and personal anecdotes, The Mind Club explores the moral dimensions of mind perception with wit and compassion, revealing the surprisingly simple basis for what compels us to love and hate, to harm and to protect.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Really brilliant and just crammed with wisdom and insight. It will genuinely make a difference to me and the way I think about myself.&#8217; Stephen Fry    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    Everyone says they want to be happy. But that&#8217;s much more easily said than done. What does being happy actually mean? And how do you even know when you feel it?    </p>
<p>                    In Happy Derren Brown explores changing concepts of happiness &#8211; from the surprisingly modern wisdom of the Stoics and Epicureans in classical times right up until today, when the self-help industry has attempted to claim happiness as its own. He shows how many of self-help&#8217;s suggested routes to happiness and success &#8211; such as positive thinking, self-belief and setting goals &#8211; can be disastrous to follow and, indeed, actually cause anxiety.    </p>
<p>                    Happy aims to reclaim happiness and to enable us to appreciate the good things in life, in all their transient glory. By taking control of the stories we tell ourselves, by remembering that &#8216;everything&#8217;s fine&#8217; even when it might not feel that way, we can allow ourselves to flourish and to live more happily.    </p>
<p>                    ___    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying:<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Immensely positive and life-affirming&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;This is the blue print to a good life&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Thought provoking and potentially life-changing.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Are you still the person who lived fifteen, ten or five years ago? Fifteen, ten or five minutes ago? Can you plan for your retirement if the you of thirty years hence is in some sense a different person? What and who is the real you? Does it remain constant over time and place, or is it something much more fragmented and fluid? Is it known to you, or are you as much a mystery to yourself as others are to you?With his usual wit, infectious curiosity and bracing scepticism, Julian Baggini sets out to answer these fundamental and unsettling questions. His fascinating quest draws on the history of philosophy, but also anthropology, sociology, psychology and neurology; he talks to theologians, priests, allegedly reincarnated Lamas, and delves into real-life cases of lost memory, personality disorders and personal transformation; and, candidly and engagingly, he describes his own experiences. After reading The Ego Trick, you will never see yourself in the same way again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This book will open  your eyes, mind and heart to a way of being in the world that will make  our world a better and more caring one.&#8217; ARCHBISHOP DESMOND TUTU, author of The Book of Joy    </p>
<p>                    Ubuntu is an ancient Southern African philosophy about how to live life well, together. It is a belief in a universal human bond, which says: I am only because you are.     </p>
<p>                    It means that if you can see everyone as fully human, connected to  you by their humanity, you will never be able to treat others as  disposable or without worth. By embracing the philosophy of ubuntu  it&#8217;s possible to  overcome division and be stronger together in a world  where the wise build bridges and the foolish build walls.    </p>
<p>                    These  14 beautifully illustrated lessons from the Rainbow Nation are an  essential toolkit to helping us all to live better, together. In  stories, practical lessons and applications that recognise our common  humanity, our connectedness and interdependence, Everyday Ubuntu helps us to make sense of the world and our place in it.    </p>
<p>                    Exploring  ideas of kindness and forgiveness, tolerance and the power of  listening, this definitive guide offers practical tips on how we can all  benefit from embracing others and living a more fulfilling life as part  of the large family to which we all belong.<br />
                    __________    </p>
<p>                    What readers are saying about Everyday Ubuntu:    </p>
<p>                    ***** &#8216;A concept we should all live by.&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Lots of little gems to help with everyday life.&#8217;<br />
                    ***** &#8216;Must read&#8230; Very inspiring and thought-provoking.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE #1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    One of TIME&#8217;s Ten Best Nonfiction Books of the Decade    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Captivating, fascinating, profoundly beautiful. . . Rovelli is a wonderfully humane, gentle and witty guide for he is as much philosopher and poet as he is a scientist&#8217; John Banville    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;We are time. We are this space, this clearing opened by the traces of memory inside the connections between our neurons. We are memory. We are nostalgia. We are longing for a future that will not come&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Time is a mystery that does not cease to puzzle us. Philosophers, artists and poets have long explored its meaning while scientists have found that its structure is different from the simple intuition we have of it. From Boltzmann to quantum theory, from Einstein to loop quantum gravity, our understanding of time has been undergoing radical transformations. Time flows at a different speed in different places, the past and the future differ far less than we might think, and the very notion of the present evaporates in the vast universe.    </p>
<p>                    With his extraordinary charm and sense of wonder, bringing together science, philosophy and art, Carlo Rovelli unravels this mystery. Enlightening and consoling, The Order of Time shows that to understand ourselves we need to reflect on time &#8212; and to understand time we need to reflect on ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    Translated by Simon Carnell and Erica Segre</p>
