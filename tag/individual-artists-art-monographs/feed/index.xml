										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about rivalry among artists. Not the kind of rivalry that grows out of hatred and dislike, but rather, rivalry that emerges from admiration, friendship, love. The kind of rivalry that existed between Degas and Manet, Picasso and Matisse, Pollock and de Kooning, and Freud and Bacon.     </p>
<p>                    These were some of the most famous and creative relationships in the history of art, driving each individual to heights of creativity and inspiration &#8211; and provoking them to despair, jealousy and betrayal. Matisse&#8217;s success threatened Picasso so much that his friends would throw darts at a portrait of his rival&#8217;s beloved daughter Marguerite, shouting &#8216;there&#8217;s one in the eye for Matisse!&#8217; And Willem de Kooning&#8217;s twisted friendship with Jackson Pollock didn&#8217;t stop him taking up with his friend&#8217;s lover barely a year after Pollock&#8217;s fatal car crash.    </p>
<p>                    In The Art of Rivalry, Pulitzer Prize-winning art critic Sebastian Smee explores how, as both artists struggled to come into their own, they each played vital roles in provoking the other&#8217;s creative breakthroughs &#8211; ultimately determining the course of modern art itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost, critically acclaimed historian Toby Lester tells the story of the world&#8217;s most iconic image, the Vitruvian Man, and sheds surprising new light on the artistry and scholarship of Leonardo da Vinci, one of history&#8217;s most fascinating figures.     </p>
<p>                    Deftly weaving together art, architecture, history, theology, and much else, Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost is a first-rate intellectual enchantment.&#8221;&#8211;Charles Mann, author of 1493     </p>
<p>                    Da Vinci didn&#8217;t summon Vitruvian Man out of thin air. He was inspired by the idea originally formulated by the Roman architect Vitruvius, who suggested that the human body could be made to fit inside a circle, long associated with the divine, and a square, related to the earthly and secular. To place a man inside those shapes was to imply that the human body could indeed be a blueprint for the workings of the universe. Da Vinci elevated Vitruvius&#8217; idea to exhilarating heights when he set out to do something unprecedented, if the human body truly reflected the cosmos, he reasoned, then studying its anatomy more thoroughly than had ever been attempted before&#8211;peering deep into body and soul&#8211;might grant him an almost godlike perspective on the makeup of the world.     </p>
<p>                    Written with the same narrative flair and intellectual sweep as Lester&#8217;s award-winning first book, the &#8220;almost unbearably thrilling&#8221; (Simon Winchester) Fourth Part of the World, and beautifully illustrated with Da Vinci&#8217;s drawings, Da Vinci&#8217;s Ghost follows Da Vinci on his journey to understanding the secrets of the Vitruvian man. It captures a pivotal time in Western history when the Middle Ages were giving way to the Renaissance, when art, science, and philosophy were rapidly converging, and when it seemed possible that a single human being might embody&#8211;and even understand&#8211;the nature of the universe.</p>
