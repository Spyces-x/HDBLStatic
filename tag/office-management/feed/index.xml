										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is commonplace that counselors, therapists, teachers, business leaders, executives, coaches, and other helping professionals &#8211; specifically trained in group leadership &#8211; often fail to apply their knowledge and skills to settings in which they might matter most. The same practitioners who guide others may not be able to put that background to work when they find themselves supervising peers, leading meetings, or even managing conflict at the dinner table. What<br />
                    You Don&#8217;t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should discusses ways that leadership skills and interventions can operate throughout daily life. Applications from group therapy and systemic intervention models will be applied to the realities that people face every day &#8211; inspiring others, facilitating<br />
                    meetings, running social events, guiding conversations, and empowering others. This text uniquely integrates the latest research, theory, concepts, and skills into a model that applies these ideas to every aspect of daily life. The author draws not only from the extensive literature in group dynamics, counseling, and psychology, but also includes insights from business leaders gleaned from over a dozen interviews he conducted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times Notable Book &#8211; Daily Beast Best Nonfiction of 2014 &#8211; Inc. Magazine&#8217;s Most Thought-Provoking Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Man is born free, but he is everywhere in cubicles.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    How did we get from Scrooge&#8217;s office to &#8220;Office Space&#8221;? From bookkeepers in dark countinghouses to freelancers in bright cafes? What would the world be like without the vertical file cabinet? What would the world be like without the office at all? In Cubed, Nikil Saval chronicles the evolution of the office in a fascinating, often funny, and sometimes disturbing anatomy of the white-collar world and how it came to be the way it is. Drawing on the history of architecture and business, as well as a host of pop culture artifacts&#8211;from Mad Men to Dilbert (and, yes, The Office)&#8211;and ranging in time from the earliest clerical houses to the surprisingly utopian origins of the cubicle to the funhouse campuses of Silicon Valley, Cubed is an all-encompassing investigation into the way we work, why we do it the way we do (and often don&#8217;t like it), and how we might do better.</p>

<p>                    The way we work is broken. It takes forever to get anything done. Meetings and emails are incessant. Bureaucracy stifles talent and creativity.  Is this really the best we can do?    </p>
<p>                    Aaron Dignan teaches companies how to eliminate red tape, tap into collective intelligence, and rethink long-held traditions that no longer make sense. In Brave New Work, he shows you how to revolutionize the way you, your team and your company works forever.     </p>
<p>                    *         Have fewer but better meetings<br />
                    *         Create a culture of honesty, transparency and trust<br />
                    *         Cut down on rules to be more efficient<br />
                    *         Be more agile and adaptive<br />
                    *         Reignite passion and energy throughout your organisation    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Clear, powerful and urgent, it&#8217;s a must read for anyone who cares about where they work and how they work&#8221; &#8211; Seth Godin, author of This is Marketing and Purple Cow</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Harvard Business Review asked Robert Sutton for suggestions for its annual list of Breakthrough Ideas, he told them that the best business practice he knew of was &#8216;the no asshole rule&#8217;. Sutton&#8217;s piece became one of the most popular articles ever to appear in the HBR. Spurred on by the fear and despair that people expressed, the tricks they used to survive with dignity in asshole-infested places, the revenge stories that made him laugh out loud and the other small wins that they celebrated against mean-spirited people, Sutton was persuaded to write THE NO ASSHOLE RULE.<br />
                    He believes passionately that civilised workplaces are not a naive dream, that they do exist, do bolster performance and that widespread contempt can be erased and replaced with mutual respect when a team or organisation is managed right. There is a huge temptation by executives and those in positions of authority to overlook this trait especially when exhibited by so-called producers, but Sutton shows how overall productivity suffers when the workplace is subjected to this kind of stress.</p>

                    &#8216;Bruce Daisley is on a mission to change the world of work.&#8217; The Times<br />
                    __________________________    </p>
<p>                    From the creator of hit podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat comes a revolutionary re-envisioning of how to enjoy your job.    </p>
<p>                    Do you want to get more done, feel less stressed and love your job again?    </p>
<p>                    Sometimes having a job can feel like hard work. But between Monk Mode mornings, silent meetings and crisp Thursdays, the solutions are at your fingertips.    </p>
<p>                    Bruce Daisley knows a thing or two about the workplace. In the course of a career that has taken him from some of the world&#8217;s biggest media companies to Twitter, via Google and YouTube, he has become a leading expert on how we work now. And in his hugely popular podcast Eat Sleep Work Repeat, he has explored ways to fix it. Now he shares 30 brilliant &#8211; and refreshingly simple &#8211; tips on how to make your job more productive, more rewarding &#8211; and much, much more enjoyable.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;With just 30 changes, you can transform your work experience from bland and boring (or worse) to fulfilling, fun, and even joyful.&#8217; Daniel Pink, author of When and Drive    </p>
<p>                    __________________________    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;This is a warm, wise and funny book which provides a terrific summary of some of the science &#8211; and stories &#8211; behind what makes work a positive part of people&#8217;s lives. From the importance of lunch to the value of laughter, this book gives witty and practical advice. I loved it and I&#8217;ve already started changing some of the things I do at work, as a result!&#8221; &#8211; Professor Sophie Scott    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Don&#8217;t quit yet! In this book, Bruce shares remarkable advice that may well have you laughing while you work and truly loving your job.&#8221; &#8211; Biz Stone, Twitter co-founder    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Bruce Daisley&#8217;s The Joy of Work is a joy to read. It translates the best of workplace psychology research into practical ways of establishing creative and liveable cultures at work-a must read for all of us 9-5ers!&#8221; &#8211; Professor Sir Cary Cooper, ALLIANCE Manchester Business School, University of Manchester    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Bruce&#8217;s The Joy of Work is an important reminder of simple everyday practices to improve how we all work together, which will lead to greater team and individual happiness and performance. Great results will follow.&#8221; &#8211; Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter and Square    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;With just 30 changes, you can transform your work experience from bland and boring (or worse) to fulfilling, fun, and even joyful. Bruce Daisley has pulled together threads of research and woven them into a tapestry of strategies that actually work, and that don&#8217;t depend on the CEO&#8217;s sign-off for implementation. You can begin changing your work culture today at the individual, team, and organisational levels with these tactics that increase creativity, productivity, and satisfaction.&#8221; &#8211; Daniel Pink, author of WHEN and DRIVE</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This &#8220;brilliant and provocative&#8221; (Walter Isaacson) guide shares nine principles to adapt and survive the technological changes shaping our future from the director of the MIT Media Lab and a veteran Wired journalist.  The world is more complex and volatile today than at any other time in our history. The tools of our modern existence are getting faster, cheaper, and smaller at an exponential rate, transforming every aspect of society, from business to culture and from the public sphere to our most private moments. The people who succeed will be the ones who learn to think differently.  In Whiplash, Joi Ito and Jeff Howe distill that logic into nine organizing principles for navigating and surviving this tumultuous period: Emergence over Authority Pull over Push Compasses over Maps Risk over Safety Disobedience over Compliance Practice over Theory Diversity over Ability Resilience over Strength Systems over Objects   Filled with incredible case studies and cutting-edge research and philosophies from the MIT Media Lab and beyond, Whiplash will help you adapt and succeed in this unpredictable world.</p>
