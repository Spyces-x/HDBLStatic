										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Funny, angry, urgent. Ghodsee is going to start a revolution&#8217; Daisy Buchanan, author of The Sisterhood     </p>
<p>                    A witty, fiercely intelligent exploration of why capitalism is rigged against women and what we can do about it.    </p>
<p>                    Unregulated capitalism is bad for women. Socialism, if done properly, leads to economic independence, better labour conditions, better work/family balance and, yes, even better sex.     </p>
<p>                    If you like the idea of such outcomes, then come along for an exploration of how we can change women&#8217;s lives for the better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The act of reproduction, and its variants, never change much, but our ideas about the meaning of sex are in constant flux. Switch a decade, cross a border, or traverse class lines and the harmless pleasures of one group become the gravest crimes in another.     </p>
<p>                    Combining meticulous research and lively storytelling, The Boundaries of Desire traces the fast-moving bloodsport of sex law over the past century, and challenges our most cherished notions about family, power, gender, and identity.     </p>
<p>                    Starting when courts censored birth control information as pornography and let men rape their wives, and continuing through the &#8220;sexual revolution&#8221; and into the present day (when rape, gay rights, sex trafficking, and sex on the internet saturate the news), Berkowitz shows how the law has remained out of synch with the convulsive changes in sexual morality.     </p>
<p>                    By focusing on the stories of real people, Berkowitz adds a compelling human element to what might otherwise be faceless legal battles. The law is made by people, after all, and nothing sparks intolerance &#8211; on the left and right &#8212; more than sex. Ultimately, Berkowitz shows the emptiness of sanctimonious condemnation, and argues that sexual questions are too subtle and volatile for simple, catch-all solutions.</p>

Drawing on extensive research and interviews with renowned behavioural scientists, sexologists, psychologists and everyday women, Daniel Bergner asks:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Do women really crave intimacy and emotional connection?      </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Are women more disposed to sex with strangers or multiple partners than either science or society have ever let on?      </p>
<p>                    &#8211; And is &#8216;the fairer sex&#8217; actually more sexually aggressive and anarchic than men?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The International No. 1 Bestseller<br />
                    A BBC 2 Between the Covers Book Club Pick    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Cuts to the heart of who we are&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                    &#8216;A book that begs discussion&#8217; Vanity Fair    </p>
<p>                    All Lina wanted was to be desired. How did she end up in a marriage with two children and a husband who wouldn&#8217;t touch her?    </p>
<p>                    All Maggie wanted was to be understood. How did she end up in a relationship with her teacher and then in court, a hated pariah in her small town?    </p>
<p>                    All Sloane wanted was to be admired. How did she end up a sexual object of men, including her husband, who liked to watch her have sex with other men and women?    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I will probably re-read it every year of my life&#8217; Caitlin Moran    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Will have millions nodding in recognition&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As gripping as the most gripping thriller&#8217; Marian Keyes    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;When I picked it up, I felt I&#8217;d been waiting half my life to read it&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The kind of bold, timely, once-in-a-generation book that every house should have a copy of, and probably will before too long&#8217; New Statesman    </p>
<p>                    The book Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Alexa Chung, Jodie Comer, Reese Witherspoon, Harry Styles, Fearne Cotton, Caitriona Balfe, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sharon Horgan, Zoe Ball, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Davina McCall, Gemma Chan, Christine and the Queens and Gillian Anderson are all reading</p>
