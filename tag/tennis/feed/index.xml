										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The fiercely honest, fearless, darkly funny autobiography of global tennis star Maria Sharapova    </p>
<p>                    In the middle of the night, a father and his daughter step off a Greyhound bus in Florida and head straight to the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy. They ring the bell, though no one is expecting them and they don&#8217;t speak English. They have arrived from Russia with just seven hundred dollars and the conviction that this six-year-old girl will be the world&#8217;s next great tennis star. They are right.    </p>
<p>                    This is Maria Sharapova&#8217;s gripping and fearless autobiography, telling her story from her roots in the small Siberian town her parents fled to after the Chernobyl disaster, through her arrival in the US with nothing and her phenomenal rise to success &#8211; winning Wimbledon aged just seventeen &#8211; to the disasters that threatened her career and her fight back.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling memoir&#8217; David Shaftel, Financial Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An illuminating account &#8230; This is the bildungsroman of a controversial champion, a portrait of the athlete as an uncommonly driven young woman&#8217; Julia Felsenthal, Vogue</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Improve your game and discover your true potential by increasing your concentration, willpower and confidence.    </p>
<p>                    Described by Billie Jean King as her &#8216;tennis bible&#8217;, Timothy Gallwey&#8217;s multi-million bestseller, including an introduction from acclaimed sports psychologist Geoff Beattie, has been a phenomenon for players of all abilities since it was first published in 1972.    </p>
<p>                    Instead of concentrating on how to improve your technique, it starts from the understanding that &#8216;every game is composed of two parts, an outer game and an inner game&#8217;. The former is played against opponents on the court, but the latter is a battle within ourselves as we try and overcome self-doubt and anxiety. It is often won or lost before a ball has been hit.    </p>
<p>                      Gallwey&#8217;s revolutionary approach, built on a foundation of Zen thinking and humanistic psychology, will teach you how to develop your concentration, work on your gamesmanship and help you break bad habits. You will also learn how to trust yourself on the court and how to maintain clarity of mind throughout the match, giving you a clear psychological advantage over your opponent.    </p>
<p>                      Whether you are an amateur or a pro, The Inner Game of Tennis is essential reading for overcoming the self-doubt, nervousness, and lapses of concentration that can keep a player from winning. It is guaranteed to change the way you play tennis forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praise for Mind Gym    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Believing in yourself is paramount to success for any athlete. Gary&#8217;s lessons and David&#8217;s writing provide examples of the importance of the mental game.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Ben Crenshaw, two-time Masters champion and former Ryder Cup captain    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Mind Gym hits a home run. If you want to build mental muscle for the major leagues, read this book.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Ken Griffey Jr., Major League Baseball MVP    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I read Mind Gym on my way to the Sydney Olympics and really got a lot out of it. Gary has important lessons to teach, and you&#8217;ll find the exercises fun and beneficial.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Jason Kidd, NBA All-Star and Olympic gold-medal winner    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I love the book Mind Gym.&#8221;<br />
                    &#8211;Madison Kocian, 2016 U.S. Women&#8217;s Gymnastics Team, 2015 Uneven Bars World Champion, as told to Us Weekly    </p>
<p>                    In Mind Gym, noted sports psychology consultant Gary Mack explains how your mind influences your performance on the field or on the court as much as your physical skill does, if not more so. Through forty accessible lessons and inspirational anecdotes from prominent athletes&#8211;many of whom he has worked with&#8211;you will learn the same techniques and exercises Mack uses to help elite athletes build mental &#8220;muscle.&#8221; Mind Gym will give you the &#8220;head edge&#8221; over the competition.</p>

<p>                    Gathered for the first time in a deluxe collector&#8217;s edition, here are David Foster Wallace&#8217;s legendary writings on tennis, five tour-de-force pieces written with a competitor&#8217;s insight and a fan&#8217;s obsessive enthusiasm. Wallace brings his dazzling literary magic to the game he loved as he celebrates the other-worldly genius of Roger Federer; offers a wickedly witty disection of Tracy Austin&#8217;s memoir; considers the artistry of Michael Joyce, a supremely disciplined athlete on the threshold of fame; resists the crush of commerce at the U.S. Open; and recalls his own career as a near-great junior player.     </p>
<p>                    Whiting Award-winning writer John Jeremiah Sullivan provides an introduction.</p>
