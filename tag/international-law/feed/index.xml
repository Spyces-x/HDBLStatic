										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if the new far right poses a graver threat to liberal democracy than jihadists or mass migration?    </p>
<p>                    From Europe to the United States and beyond, opportunistic politicians have exploited economic crisis, terrorist attacks and an influx of refugees to bring hateful and reactionary views from the margins of political discourse into the corridors of power. This climate has already helped propel Donald Trump to the White House, pushed Britain out of the European Union, and put Marine Le Pen within striking distance of the French presidency.    </p>
<p>                    Sasha Polakow-Suransky&#8217;s on-the-ground reportage and interviews with the rising stars of the new right tell the story of how we got here, tracing the global rise of anti-immigration politics and the ruthlessly effective rebranding of Europe&#8217;s new far right as defenders of Western liberal values.    </p>
<p>                    Go Back to Where You Came From is an indispensable account of why xenophobia went mainstream in countries known historically as defenders of human rights and models of tolerance.</p>
