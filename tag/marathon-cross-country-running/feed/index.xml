										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the heart of Born to Run lies a mysterious tribe of Mexican Indians, the Tarahumara, who live quietly in canyons and are reputed to be the best distance runners in the world; in 1993, one of them, aged 57, came first in a prestigious 100-mile race wearing a toga and sandals. A small group of the world&#8217;s top ultra-runners (and the awe-inspiring author) make the treacherous journey into the canyons to try to learn the tribe&#8217;s secrets and then take them on over a course 50 miles long.    </p>
<p>                    With incredible energy and smart observation, McDougall tells this story while asking what the secrets are to being an incredible runner. Travelling to labs at Harvard, Nike, and elsewhere, he comes across an incredible cast of characters, including the woman who recently broke the world record for 100 miles and for her encore ran a 2:50 marathon in a bikini, pausing to down a beer at the 20 mile mark.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Lyrical and passionate &#8230; a celebration of the human spirit and what it can achieve&#8217; Observer    </p>
<p>                    Two hours to cover twenty-six miles and 385 yards. An exceptional feat of speed, mental strength and endurance. The sub-two-hour marathon is running&#8217;s Everest, a feat once seen as impossible for the human body. But now we have reached the mountaintop.    </p>
<p>                    In this spellbinding book Ed Caesar takes us into the world of the elite of the elite: the greatest marathoners on earth. Through the stories of these rich characters, and their troubled lives, he traces the history of the marathon as well as the science, physiology and psychology involved in running so fast, for so long. And he shows us why this most democratic of races retains its savage, enthralling appeal &#8211; why we are drawn to test ourselves to the limit.    </p>
<p>                    Now with a new afterword telling the inside story of how Eliud Kipchoge achieved the impossible, with exclusive access to Nike&#8217;s #Breaking2 project, and the Ineos159 event at which the barrier was finally broken.</p>
