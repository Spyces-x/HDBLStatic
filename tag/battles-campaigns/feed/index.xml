										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The classic international million copy bestseller recounting the epic turning point of the second world war</p>
<p>                    In October 1942, a Panzer officer wrote &#8216;Stalingrad is no longer a town&#8230; Animals flee this hell; the hardest stones cannot bear it for long; only men endure&#8217;. </p>
<p>                    The battle for Stalingrad became the focus of Hitler and Stalin&#8217;s determination to win the gruesome, vicious war on the eastern front. The citizens of Stalingrad endured unimaginable hardship; the battle, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting in each room of each building,  was brutally destructive to both armies. But the eventual victory of the Red Army, and the failure of Hitler&#8217;s Operation Barbarossa, was the first defeat of Hitler&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe, and the start of his decline.</p>
<p>                    An extraordinary story of tactical genius, civilian bravery and the nature of war itself, which changed how history is written, Stalingrad is a testament to the vital role of the Soviet war effort.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;A superb re-telling. Beevor combines a soldier&#8217;s understanding of war&#8217;s realities with the narrative techniques of a novelist . . . This is a book that lets the reader look into the face of battle&#8217; Orlando Figes, Sunday Telegraph </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A brilliantly researched tour de force of military history&#8217; Sarah Bradford, The Times</p>
<p>                    Antony Beevor is the renowned author of Stalingrad, which won the Samuel Johnson Prize, the Wolfson Prize for History and the Hawthornden Prize for Literature, and Berlin, which received the first Longman-History Today Trustees&#8217; Award. His books have sold nearly four million copies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Arab Revolt against the Turks in World War One was, in the words of T.E. Lawrence, &#8216;a sideshow of a sideshow&#8217;. Amidst the slaughter in European trenches, the Western combatants paid scant attention to the Middle Eastern theatre. As a result, the conflict was shaped to a remarkable degree by a small handful of adventurers and low-level officers far removed from the corridors of power.   At the centre of it all was Lawrence. In early 1914 he was an archaeologist excavating ruins in the sands of Syria; by 1917 he was battling both the enemy and his own government to bring about the vision he had for the Arab people. Operating in the Middle East at the same time, but to wildly different ends, were three other important players: a German attache, an American oilman and a committed Zionist. The intertwined paths of these four young men &#8211; the schemes they put in place, the battles they fought, the betrayals they endured and committed &#8211; mirror the grandeur, intrigue and tragedy of the war in the desert.</p>
