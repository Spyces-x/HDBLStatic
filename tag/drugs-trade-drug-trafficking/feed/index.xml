										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jason Bourne is back. An exhilarating rush of a novel in Robert Ludlum&#8217;s legendary series.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hugely enjoyable&#8217; Sunday Times.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Watch your back 007 &#8211; Bourne is out to get you&#8217; &#8211; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    When the head of Mossad learns that a major Mexican drug lord may be trafficking something far more deadly than drugs, he turns to his friend Jason Bourne for help. Bourne agrees to investigate, but he has his own agenda: revenge.    </p>
<p>                    The drug lord is responsible for the murder of Rebeka &#8211; one of the only people Bourne has ever truly cared for. But as Bourne attempts to avenge the woman he loved, he becomes embroiled in a monstrous world-wide scheme involving the Chinese, Mexicans, and Russians. Each step closer to vengeance is a step closer to his own death.    </p>

<p>                    THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<br />
                    THE INSPIRATION FOR THE FEATURE FILM THE UNITED STATES VS. BILLIE HOLIDAY    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Screamingly addictive&#8217; STEPHEN FRY<br />
                    &#8216;Superb &#8230; Thrilling story-telling&#8217; NAOMI KLEIN<br />
                    &#8216;A powerful contribution to an urgent debate&#8217; GUARDIAN    </p>
<p>                    What if everything we&#8217;ve been told about addiction is wrong? One of Johann Hari&#8217;s earliest memories is of trying to wake up one of his relatives and not being able to. As he grew older, he realised there was addiction in his family. Confused, he set out on a three-year, thirty-thousand mile journey to discover what really causes addiction &#8211; and how to solve it.     </p>
<p>                    Told through a series of gripping human stories, this book was the basis of a TED talk and animation that have been viewed more than twenty million times. It has transformed the global debate about addiction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the NBCC Award for General Nonfiction    </p>
<p>                    Named on Amazon&#8217;s Best Books of the Year 2015&#8211;Michael Botticelli, U.S. Drug Czar (Politico) Favorite Book of the Year&#8211;Angus Deaton, Nobel Prize Economics (Bloomberg/WSJ) Best Books of 2015&#8211;Matt Bevin, Governor of Kentucky (WSJ) Books of the Year&#8211;Slate.com&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2015&#8211;Entertainment Weekly&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2015 &#8211;Buzzfeed&#8217;s 19 Best Nonfiction Books of 2015&#8211;The Daily Beast&#8217;s Best Big Idea Books of 2015&#8211;Seattle Times&#8217; Best Books of 2015&#8211;Boston Globe&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;The Guardian&#8217;s The Best Book We Read All Year&#8211;Audible&#8217;s Best Books of 2015&#8211;Texas Observer&#8217;s Five Books We Loved in 2015&#8211;Chicago Public Library&#8217;s Best Nonfiction Books of 2015     </p>
<p>                    From a small town in Mexico to the boardrooms of Big Pharma to main streets nationwide, an explosive and shocking account of addiction in the heartland of America.     </p>
<p>                    In 1929, in the blue-collar city of Portsmouth, Ohio, a company built a swimming pool the size of a football field; named Dreamland, it became the vital center of the community. Now, addiction has devastated Portsmouth, as it has hundreds of small rural towns and suburbs across America&#8211;addiction like no other the country has ever faced. How that happened is the riveting story of Dreamland.     </p>
<p>                    With a great reporter&#8217;s narrative skill and the storytelling ability of a novelist, acclaimed journalist Sam Quinones weaves together two classic tales of capitalism run amok whose unintentional collision has been catastrophic. The unfettered prescribing of pain medications during the 1990s reached its peak in Purdue Pharma&#8217;s campaign to market OxyContin, its new, expensive&#8211;extremely addictive&#8211;miracle painkiller. Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin&#8211;cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico&#8217;s west coast, independent of any drug cartel&#8211;assaulted small town and mid-sized cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system. Together these phenomena continue to lay waste to communities from Tennessee to Oregon, Indiana to New Mexico.     </p>
<p>                    Introducing a memorable cast of characters&#8211;pharma pioneers, young Mexican entrepreneurs, narcotics investigators, survivors, and parents&#8211;Quinones shows how these tales fit together. Dreamland is a revelatory account of the corrosive threat facing America and its heartland.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everything drug cartels do to survive and prosper they&#8217;ve learnt from big business &#8211; brand value and franchising from McDonald&#8217;s, supply chain management from Walmart, diversification from Coca-Cola. Whether it&#8217;s human resourcing, R&#038;D, corporate social responsibility, off-shoring, problems with e-commerce or troublesome changes in legislation, the drug lords face the same strategic concerns companies like Ryanair or Apple. So when the drug cartels start to think like big business, the only way to understand them is using economics.     </p>
<p>                    In Narconomics, Tom Wainwright meets everyone from coca farmers in secret Andean locations, deluded heads of state in presidential palaces, journalists with a price on their head, gang leaders who run their empires from dangerous prisons and teenage hitmen on city streets &#8211; all in search of the economic truth.</p>
