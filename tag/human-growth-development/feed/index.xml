										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kind of life would you live if you didn&#8217;t allow your fears to hold you back? The Courage Habit offers a powerful program to help you conquer your inner critic, work toward your highest aspirations, and build a courageous community.    </p>
<p>                    Are your fears preventing you from living the life you truly want? Do you ever wish that you had a better job, lived in a different city, or had more authentic and nurturing relationships? Many people believe that they would do more, accomplish more, and feel more fulfilled if only they could rid themselves of that fearful inner voice that constantly whispers, &#8220;you can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    In The Courage Habit, certified life coach Kate Swoboda offers a unique program based in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) to help you act courageously in spite of fear. By identifying your fear triggers, releasing yourself from your past experiences, and acting on what you truly value, you can make courage a daily habit.    </p>
<p>                    Using a practical four-part program, you&#8217;ll learn to understand the emotions that arise when fears are triggered, and to pause and evaluate your emotional state before you act. You&#8217;ll discover how to listen without attachment to the self-defeating messages of your inner critic, understand the critic&#8217;s function, and implement respectful boundaries so that your inner voice no longer controls your behavior. You&#8217;ll reframe self-limiting life narratives that can-without conscious awareness-dictate your day-to-day decisions. And finally, you&#8217;ll nurture more authentic connections with family, friends, and community in order to find support and reinforce the life changes you&#8217;re making.    </p>
<p>                    If you feel like something is holding you back from landing your dream job, moving to a new city, having a satisfying love relationship, or simply taking advantage of all life has to offer &#8211; and if you have a sneaking suspicion that that something is you &#8211; then this one-of-a-kind guide will show you how to finally break free from self-doubt and start living your best life.</p>
