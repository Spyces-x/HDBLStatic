										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What will the world of tomorrow be like? How does progress happen? And why don&#8217;t we have a lunar colony already? In this witty and entertaining book, Kelly and Zach Weinersmith give us a snapshot of the transformative technologies that are coming next &#8211; from robot swarms to nuclear fusion powered-toasters &#8211; and explain how they will change our world in astonishing ways. By weaving together their own research, interviews with pioneering scientists and Zach&#8217;s trademark comics, the Weinersmiths investigate why these innovations are needed, how they would work, and what is standing in their way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Firebrand conservative columnist, commentator, Internet entrepreneur, and #1 New York Times bestselling author Michelle Malkin tells the fascinating, little-known stories of the inventors who have contributed to American exceptionalism and technological progress.     </p>
<p>                    Call them America&#8217;s &#8220;tinkerpreneurs&#8221;&#8211;unsung innovators who commercialized their &#8220;little&#8221; ideas to create products, companies, wealth, and opportunities that thrive today. Tireless, self-made, and largely self-taught, they raised our standard of living with the creation of items we daily take for granted, from razors to bottle caps, flashlights to bridge cables.     </p>
<p>                    This entertaining and enlightening treasury is, in part, Michelle Malkin&#8217;s response to President Obama&#8217;s infamous assertion that &#8220;if you&#8217;ve got a business, you didn&#8217;t build that.&#8221; She examines how factors such as profit motive, intellectual property rights, patriotism, faith, family, and an unwavering belief in American exceptionalism set the stage for the creation of toilet paper, glass bottles, the hydroelectric power plant, and more.     </p>
<p>                    Demonized by the left as greedy villains and selfish barons, these visionaries have nurtured job-creating powerhouses used today by &#8220;progressive&#8221; propagandists who can&#8217;t comprehend how much comfort and convenience they enjoy as a result of the ingenious contributions by these original American dreamers. Are they rich? You bet. They earned their private rewards for the public good. Find out Who Built That&#8211;and the next time you turn on your air conditioner, say thank you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book is a house of wonders&#8217; The New York Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Steven Johnson is the Darwin of technology&#8217; Walter Issacson, author of Steve Jobs    </p>
<p>                    What connects Paleolithic bone flutes to the invention of computer software? Or the Murex sea snail to the death of the great American city? How does the bag of crisps you hold in your hand help tell the story of humanity itself?     </p>
<p>                    In his brilliant new work on the history of innovation, international bestseller Steven Johnson argues that the pursuit of novelty and wonder has always been a powerful driver of world-shaping technological change. He finds that  that throughout history, the cutting edge of innovation lies wherever people are working the hardest to keep themselves and others amused.     </p>
<p>                    Johnson&#8217;s storytelling is just as delightful as the inventions he describes, full of surprising stops along the journey from simple concepts to complex modern systems. He introduces us to the colourful innovators of leisure: the explorers, proprietors, showmen, and artists who changed the trajectory of history with their luxurious wares, exotic meals, taverns, gambling tables, and magic shows.    </p>
<p>                    Johnson compellingly argues that observers of technological and social trends should be looking for clues in novel amusements. You&#8217;ll find the future wherever people are having the most fun.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Elegant prose and excellent reporting . . . By the time I had finished reading, I had underlined many intriguing ideas.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;No doubt Inventology will be marketed to the creative business class, but there&#8217;s ample interest here even for readers who aren&#8217;t actively inventing anything.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Globe     </p>
<p>                     A doctor realizes that an innocent-looking tube is killing his patients, then reads a newspaper article that inspires him to create a better version that serves as an early warning system for infections. A father cleans up after his toddler and builds a &#8220;sippy&#8221; cup that won&#8217;t spill. An engineer dreams of a different world and pioneers the cell phone.     </p>
<p>                     By studying breakthroughs like these, we can learn how people imagine their way around &#8220;impossible&#8221; problems to discover groundbreaking answers. Pagan Kennedy reports on how enduring methods of invention can be adapted to the twenty-first century, as millions of us deploy tools like crowdfunding, big data, and 3-D printing to address our needs or realize our dreams. Drawing on fresh research and the surprising stories behind many inventions old and new to reveal the steps that most reliably produce discovery, Inventology is a myth-shattering book and a must-read for anyone who is curious about creativity and the mental leaps required to solve our most challenging problems.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;&#8216;Inventology&#8217; may be a real science; researchers are beginning to study it, and teachers are teaching it . . . A delightful account of how inventors do what they do.&#8221;&#8211;Kirkus Reviews, starred review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Offers a new perspective into the process of invention that will inform and illuminate.&#8221;&#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From its beginnings in the 1920s until its demise in the 1980s, Bell Labs-officially, the research and development wing of AT&#038;T-was the biggest, and arguably the best, laboratory for new ideas in the world. From the transistor to the laser, from digital communications to cellular telephony, it&#8217;s hard to find an aspect of modern life that hasn&#8217;t been touched by Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    In The Idea Factory, Jon Gertner traces the origins of some of the twentieth century&#8217;s most important inventions and delivers a riveting and heretofore untold chapter of American history. At its heart this is a story about the life and work of a small group of brilliant and eccentric men-Mervin Kelly, Bill Shockley, Claude Shannon, John Pierce, and Bill Baker-who spent their careers at Bell Labs.    </p>
<p>                    Today, when the drive to invent has become a mantra, Bell Labs offers us a way to enrich our understanding of the challenges and solutions to technological innovation. Here, after all, was where the foundational ideas on the management of innovation were born.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WINNER OF THE 800-CEO-READ BUSINESS BOOK OF THE YEAR 2015    </p>
<p>                    In the vein of Susan Cain&#8217;s QUIET and Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s DAVID AND GOLIATH, HOW TO FLY A HORSE is a smart, empowering book that dispels the myths around genius and creativity.    </p>
<p>                    There is a myth about how something new comes to be; that geniuses have dramatic moments of insight where great things and thoughts are born whole. Symphonies are composed complete. Science is accomplished with eureka shrieks. Businesses are built by magic touch.    </p>
<p>                    The myth is wrong. Anyone can create.     </p>
<p>                    Acclaimed technology pioneer Kevin Ashton takes us behind the scenes of creation to reveal the true process of discovery and how &#8216;new&#8217; comes to be. From Archimedes to Apple, from Kandinsky to the Coke can, from the Wright brothers &#8211; who set out to &#8216;fly a horse&#8217; &#8211; to Woody Allen, he exposes the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures and countless ordinary and often uncredited acts that led to our most astounding breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The incredible true story of the origin of human flight, by the Pulitzer Prize-winning author David McCullough.    </p>
<p>                     On a winter day in 1903, in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, two unknown brothers from Ohio changed history. But it would take the world some time to believe what had happened: the age of flight had begun, with the first heavier-than-air, powered machine carrying a pilot.    </p>
<p>                     Who were these men and how was it that they achieved what they did?    </p>
<p>                     David McCullough, two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize, tells the surprising, profoundly human story of Wilbur and Orville Wright. Far more than a couple of unschooled Dayton bicycle mechanics who happened to hit on success, they were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity, much of which they attributed to their upbringing.    </p>
<p>                     In this thrilling book, McCullough draws on the immense riches of the Wright Papers, including private diaries, notebooks, scrapbooks, and more than a thousand letters from private family correspondence to tell the human side of the Wright Brothers&#8217; story, including the little-known contributions of their sister, Katharine, without whom things might well have gone differently for them.</p>
