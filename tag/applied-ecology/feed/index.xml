										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nature was a form of religion for naturalist, essayist, and early environmentalist Henry David Thoreau (1817-62). In communing with the natural world, he wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and &#8230; learn what it had to teach. Toward that end Thoreau built a cabin in the spring of 1845 on the shores of Walden Pond &#8212; on land owned by Ralph Waldo Emerson &#8212; outside Concord, Massachusetts. There he observed nature, farmed, built fences, surveyed, and wrote in his journal.<br />
                    One product of his two-year sojourn was this book &#8212; a great classic of American letters. Interwoven with accounts of Thoreau&#8217;s daily life (he received visitors and almost daily walked into Concord) are mediations on human existence, society, government, and other topics, expressed with wisdom and beauty of style.<br />
                    Walden offers abundant evidence of Thoreau&#8217;s ability to begin with observations on a mundane incident or the minutiae of nature and then develop these observations into profound ruminations on the most fundamental human concerns. Credited with influencing Tolstoy, Gandhi, and other thinkers, the volume remains a masterpiece of philosophical reflection.<br />
                    A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>** Winner of Royal Society Winton Prize for Science Books 2015 **    </p>
<p>                    We live in epoch-making times. The changes we humans have made in recent decades have altered our world beyond anything it has experienced in its 4.6 billion-year history. As a result, our planet is said to be crossing into the Anthropocene &#8211; the Age of Humans.     </p>
<p>                     Gaia Vince decided to travel the world at the start of this new age to see what life is really like for the people on the frontline of the planet we&#8217;ve made.  From artificial glaciers in the Himalayas to painted mountains in Peru, electrified reefs in the Maldives to garbage islands in the Caribbean, Gaia found people doing the most extraordinary things to solve the problems that we ourselves have created.    </p>
<p>                     These stories show what the Anthropocene means for all of us &#8211; and they illuminate how we might engineer Earth for our future.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;An extraordinarily good book.&#8221; -Edward O. Wilson    </p>
<p>                    The lively and definitive story of the beauty, sexuality, lore, economics, and ecology of the world &#8216;s flowers, written by a devoted scientist and illustrated with his stunning photographs.    </p>
<p>                    Flowers-and the fruits they often become-feed, clothe, and inspire us. Indeed, they have done so for all of human history. Yet although we use flowers to celebrate important occasions, to express love, and to please our senses, we know little about them, their functions in nature, or even how we depend on them.    </p>
<p>                    In a volume that will delight gardeners, naturalists, cooks, artists, or anyone interested in history or culture, pollination ecologist Stephen Buchmann serves as an expert guide through the fascinating world of flowers. He explains how other species relate to flowers in ways crucial to the natural world. Next he takes us on an engaging exploration of the roles flowers play in the production of food, spices, medicines, and perfumes. Flowering plants, Buchmann then shows, have long served as inspirational themes in art and literature. Flowers have in fact so thoroughly seduced us that we now buy some ten million a day, driving breeders to create infinite varieties and unusual blooms. In this cultural and natural investigation of floral history, Stephen Buchmann&#8217;s masterful narrative illuminates just why there is, indeed, a reason for flowers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A hymn of love to the world &#8230; A journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as  it is historical, as clever as it is wise&#8217; Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love    </p>
<p>                    As a botanist, Robin Wall Kimmerer has been trained to ask questions of nature with the tools of science. As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two ways of knowledge together.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, a mother, and a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings &#8211; asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass &#8211; offer us gifts and lessons, even if we&#8217;ve forgotten how to hear their voices. In a rich braid of reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The book that helped make Michael Pollan, the New York Times bestselling author of How to Change Your Mind, Cooked and The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma, one of the most trusted food experts in America     </p>
<p>                    Every schoolchild learns about the mutually beneficial dance of honeybees and flowers: The bee collects nectar and pollen to make honey and, in the process, spreads the flowers&#8217; genes far and wide. In The Botany of Desire,  Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires&#8211;sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control&#8211;with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind&#8217;s most basic yearnings. And just as we&#8217;ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?</p>
