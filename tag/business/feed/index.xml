										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER*</p>
<p>                     Tony Robbins, arguably the most recognizable life and business strategist and guru, is back with a timely, unique follow-up to his smash New York Times bestseller Money: Master the Game.<br />
                       Market corrections are as constant as seasons are in nature. There have been 30 such corrections in the past 30 years, yet there&#8217;s never been an action plan for how not only to survive, but thrive through each change in the stock market.<br />
                       Building upon the principles in Money: Master the Game, Robbins offers the reader specific steps they can implement to protect their investments while maximizing their wealth. It&#8217;s a detailed guide designed for investors, articulated in the common-sense, practical manner that the millions of loyal Robbins fans and students have come to expect and rely upon.<br />
                       Few have navigated the turbulence of the stock market as adeptly and successfully as Tony Robbins. His proven, consistent success over decades makes him singularly qualified to help investors (both seasoned and first-timers alike) preserve and add to their investments.</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Tony&#8217;s power is super-human&#8217; Oprah Winfrey<br />
                     &#8216;He has a great gift. He has the gift to inspire&#8217; Bill Clinton<br />
                     &#8216;Tony Robbins needs no introduction. He is committed to helping make life better for every investor&#8217; Carl Icahn<br />
                     &#8216;The high priest of human potential. The world can&#8217;t get enough of Anthony Robbins&#8217; The New York Times</p>
