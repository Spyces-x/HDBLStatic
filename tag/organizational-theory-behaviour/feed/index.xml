										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The most powerful and instructive change manual you&#8217;ll ever read. It will persuade and inspire you to change your business, your work, and maybe your life.&#8221; &#8211;Daniel H. Pink, bestselling author of A Whole New Mind     </p>
<p>                    In Practically Radical, William C. Taylor, the New York Times bestselling co-author of Mavericks at Work offers a refreshing, rigorous new look at pragmatic ways to shake things up and make positive change in difficult times.     </p>
<p>                    Exploring how twenty-five for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations&#8211;including IBM, Zappos, Swatch, the Girl Scouts, and Interpol&#8211;made remarkable strides in tough circumstances, Practically Radical raises (and answers) the make-or-break questions facing today&#8217;s leaders in every field: Do you see opportunities the competition doesn&#8217;t see? The most successful organizations embrace one-of-a-kind ideas in a world filled with me-too thinking.Do you have new ideas about where to look for new ideas? Routine practices in one field can be revolutionary when they migrate to another.Are you the most of anything? In business today, the middle of the road is the road to ruin.Are you getting the best contributions from the most people? Change is not a game best played by loners.    </p>
<p>                    Anything but your typical business book, Practically Radical is a must-own for small business owners and CEOs, for managers at all levels, and innovators and entrepreneurs of every stripe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*A new edition of the international bestseller (a #1 bestseller in Japan), featuring a new preface*    </p>
<p>                    Does the thought of working for 60 or 70 years fill you with dread? Or can you see the potential for a more stimulating future as a result of having so much extra time?     </p>
<p>                    Many of us have been raised on the traditional notion of a three-stage approach to our working lives: education, followed by work and then retirement.  But this well-established pathway is already beginning to collapse &#8211; life expectancy is rising, final-salary pensions are vanishing, and increasing numbers of people are juggling multiple careers. Whether you are 18, 45 or 60, you will need to do things very differently from previous generations and learn to structure your life in completely new ways.    </p>
<p>                    The 100-Year Life is here to help.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the unique pairing of their experience in psychology and economics, Lynda Gratton and Andrew J. Scott offer a broad-ranging analysis as well as a raft of solutions, showing how to rethink your finances, your education, your career and your relationships and create a fulfilling 100-year life.     </p>
<p>                    * How can you fashion a career and life path that defines you and your values and creates a shifting balance between work and leisure?    </p>
<p>                    * What are the most effective ways of boosting your physical and mental health over a longer and more dynamic lifespan?    </p>
<p>                    * How can you make the most of your intangible assets &#8211; such as family and friends &#8211; as you build a productive, longer life?    </p>
<p>                    * In a multiple-stage life how can you learn to make the transitions that will be so crucial and experiment with new ways of living, working and learning?    </p>
<p>                    Shortlisted for the FT/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award and featuring a new preface, The 100-Year Life is a wake-up call that describes what to expect and considers the choices and options that you will face. It is also fundamentally a call to action for individuals, politicians, firms and governments and offers the clearest demonstration that a 100-year life can be a wonderful and inspiring one.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*A  Wall Street Journal  bestseller*The forces driving today&#8217;s world of structural change create sharp bends in the road that can lead to major explosions in your existing market space. But exponential change also offers exponential opportunities. How do you leverage change to go on the offense?  The Attacker&#8217;s Advantage  is the game plan for winning in an era of ambiguity, volatility, and complexity, when every leader and every business is being challenged in new and unexpected ways.Ram Charan, harnessing an unequalled depth and breadth of experience working with leaders and companies around the globe, provides tested, practical tools to help you:Build the perceptual acuity to see around corners and detect, ahead of others, those forces,especially people, who are the catalysts of change,that could radically reshape a company or industryHave the mindset to see opportunity in uncertaintyCommit to a new path forward despite the unknowns, positioning your business to make the next move ahead of competitorsBreak the blockages that can hold your company backKnow when to accelerate and when to shift the short-term and long-term balanceMake your organization agile and steerable by aligning people, priorities, decision-making power, budgeting and capital allocation, and key performance indicators to the new realities of the marketplace The Attacker&#8217;s Advantage  provides a stark and simple challenge: stay in a legacy world of incremental gains or defensiveness, or be an attacker by creating a new world, scaling it up quickly, ahead of the traditional players.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A groundbreaking book that sheds new light on the vital importance of teams as the fundamental unit of organization and competition in the global economy.  Teams-we depend on them for both our professional success and our personal happiness. But isn&#8217;t it odd how little scrutiny we give them? The teams that make up our lives are created mostly by luck, happenstance, or circumstance-but rarely by design. In trivial matters-say, a bowling team, the leadership of a neighborhood group, or a holiday party committee-success by serendipity is already risky enough. But when it comes to actions by fast-moving start-ups, major corporations, nonprofit institutions, and governments, leaving things to chance can be downright dangerous.  Offering vivid reports of the latest scientific research, compelling case studies, and great storytelling, Team Genius shows managers and executives that the planning, design, and management of great teams no longer have to be a black art. It explores solutions to essential questions that could spell the difference between success and obsolescence. Do you know how to reorganize your subpar teams to turn them into top performers?<br />
                    Can you identify which of the top-performing teams in your company are reaching the end of their life span? Do you have the courage to shut them down? Do you know how to create a replacement team that will be just as effective-without losing time or damaging morale? And, most important, are your teams the right size for the job?  Throughout, Rich Karlgaard and Michael S. Malone share insights and real-life examples gleaned from their careers as journalists, analysts, investors, and globetrotting entrepreneurs, meeting successful teams and team leaders to reveal some &#8220;new truths&#8221;:  *  The right team size is usually one fewer person than what managers think they need. *  The greatest question facing good teams is not how to succeed, but how to die. *  Good &#8220;chemistry&#8221; often makes for the least effective teams. *  Cognitive diversity yields the highest performance gains-but only if you understand what it is. *  How to find the &#8220;bliss point&#8221; in team intimacy-and become three times more productive. *  How to identify destructive team members before they do harm. *  Why small teams are 40 percent more likely to create a successful breakthrough than a solo genius is.<br />
                    *  Why groups of 7 (+- 2), 150, and 1,500 are magic sizes for teams. Eye-opening, grounded, and essential, Team Genius is the next big idea to revolutionize business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A revised and updated edition of the acclaimed Wall Street Journal bestseller that explores why some leaders drain capability and intelligence from their teams while others amplify it to produce better results.  We&#8217;ve all had experience with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drains intelligence, energy, and capability from the people around them and always needs to be the smartest person in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, light bulbs go off over people&#8217;s heads; ideas flow and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now when leaders are expected to do more with less.<br />
                    In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explores these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations-getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation. In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman has identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use-even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. This revered classic has been updated with new examples of Multipliers, as well as two new chapters one on accidental Diminishers, and one on how to deal with Diminishers.  Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. Multipliers will show you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adaptability is the key human trait.

No glib answers here, simply hard-won wisdom that will provoke big changes for organizations large and small.&#8217; &#8211; Seth Godin, author of Linchpin    </p>
<p>                    The Wall Street Journal Top Ten Bestseller: The 10 strategies to sustainable growth, based on a purpose-led culture for organizations large and small.    </p>
<p>                    Tiffani Bova, the Growth and Innovation Evangelist at Salesforce, draws on her expertise as a consultant and practitioner to devise a new framework for business leaders looking to pursue growth. We&#8217;re witnessing an age of endless customization, and growth strategy is no exception. There&#8217;s no one size fits all strategy; a winning strategy for one business may spell doom for another.    </p>
<p>                    In Growth IQ, Bova determines that there are ten simple &#8211; but easily misunderstood &#8211; growth paths, and explains how companies can get a handle on their particular business context, and use it to determine the right combination and sequence of growth paths to take them into the future.     </p>
<p>                    Bova breaks down the strategies deployed by a wide range of companies to show you how:    </p>
<p>                      *  GE and John Deere have lasted over a century and continue to thrive by combining their strategy of innovative product development with a renewed focus on R&#038;D and customer experience.<br />
                      *  Marvel transformed from a struggling comic book publisher to a global entertainment behemoth by realigning their market penetration strategy to focus on comic book characters, instead of just comic books.<br />
                      *  Gateway&#8217;s attempt at market expansion into brick-and-mortar retail led to its failure, while the same move by Apple has accelerated its growth.    </p>
<p>                    Whether your company is on a growth spurt, in a worrying stall, or showing signs of decline, Growth IQ is your map to charting the course of your company&#8217;s future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Executives from The Second City-the world&#8217;s premier comedy theater and school of improvisation-reveal improvisational techniques that can help any organization develop innovators, encourage adaptable leaders, and build transformational businesses.  For more than fifty years, The Second City comedy theater in Chicago has been a training ground for some of the best comic minds in the industry-including John Belushi, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Mike Myers, Steve Carell, Stephen Colbert, and Tina Fey. But it also provides one-of-a-kind leadership training to cutting-edge companies, nonprofits, and public sector organizations-all aimed at increasing creativity, collaboration, and teamwork.  The rules for leadership and teamwork have changed, and the skills that got professionals ahead a generation ago don&#8217;t work anymore. Now The Second City provides a new toolkit individuals and organizations can use to thrive in a world increasingly shaped by speed, social communication, and decentralization.<br />
                    Based on eight principles of improvisation, Yes, And helps to develop these skills and foster them in high-potential leaders and their teams, including: *  Mastering the ability to co-create in an ensemble *  Fostering a &#8220;yes, and&#8221; approach to work *  Embracing failure to accelerate high performance *  Leading by listening and by learning to follow *  Innovating by making something out of nothing Yes, And is a must-read for professionals and organizations, helping to develop the invaluable leadership skills needed to succeed today.</p>

<p>                    Startups, growth-stage companies, and private equity-backed companies all have one thing in common: They need high-growth individuals to execute high-growth plans. As a leader trying to achieve ambitious organizational goals, you need people who can do more than just keep up; you need people who can set the pace. You need high-growth individuals.    </p>
<p>                    Disrupt Yourself helps high-growth individuals&#8211;and those trying to attain this status&#8211;learn the tools and frameworks necessary to make changes that matter. This book helps you understand how these frameworks of disruptive innovation can apply to your particular path, whether you are:    </p>
<p>                    A self-starter ready to make a disruptive pivot in your business<br />
                    A high-potential individual charting your career trajectory<br />
                    A manager looking to instill innovative thinking within your team<br />
                    A leader facing industry changes that make for an uncertain future    </p>
<p>                    Whitney Johnson used the theory of disruptive innovation to invest in publicly traded stocks and early-stage private companies, and now she applies the framework to the personal and professional growth of individuals. We are living in an era of accelerating disruption, and no one is immune. Johnson makes the compelling case that managing the S-curve waves of learning and mastery is a requisite skill for the future. If you want to be successful in unexpected ways and achieve your wildest goals, follow your own disruptive path. Dare to innovate. Do something astonishing. Disrupt yourself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Humility Is the New Smart     </p>
<p>                     Your job is at risk&#8211;if not now, then soon. We are on the leading edge of a Smart Machine Age led by artificial intelligence that will be as transformative for us as the Industrial Revolution was for our ancestors. Smart machines will take over millions of jobs in manufacturing, office work, the service sector, the professions, you name it. Not only can they know more data and analyze it faster than any mere human, say Edward Hess and Katherine Ludwig, but smart machines are free of the emotional, psychological, and cultural baggage that so often mars human thinking.     </p>
<p>                     So we can&#8217;t beat &#8217;em and we can&#8217;t join &#8217;em. To stay relevant, we have to play a different game. Hess and Ludwig offer us that game plan. We need to excel at critical, creative, and innovative thinking and at genuinely engaging with others&#8211;things machines can&#8217;t do well. The key is to change our definition of what it means to be smart. Hess and Ludwig call it being NewSmart. In this extraordinarily timely book, they offer detailed guidance for developing NewSmart attitudes and four critical behaviors that will help us adapt to the new reality.     </p>
<p>                     The crucial mindset underlying NewSmart is humility&#8211;not self-effacement but an accurate self-appraisal: acknowledging you can&#8217;t have all the answers, remaining open to new ideas, and committing yourself to lifelong learning. Drawing on extensive multidisciplinary research, Hess and Ludwig emphasize that the key to success in this new era is not to be more like the machines but to excel at the best of what makes us human.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author Rodd Wagner tackles one of the most destructive problems facing organizations today-the breakdown of the relationship between employees and the organizations they work for    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Your people are not your greatest asset. They&#8217;re not yours, and they&#8217;re not assets.&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    With this declaration, one of the leading authorities on employee performance rolls up his sleeves against the weasel words, contradictions, bad habits, and intrusions that reduce people to &#8220;human resources.&#8221; To &#8220;FTEs.&#8221; To &#8220;human capital.&#8221; To flesh-and-blood widgets.    </p>
<p>                    Armed with empirical evidence from the provocative studies he leads around the globe, Wagner guides you through the new realities of what it takes to get the highest levels of intensity from people in a more mercenary, skeptical, and wired work world. He explains how elements such as individualization, fearlessness, transparency, recognition, and coolness are reciprocated with loyalty, productivity, innovation, and&#8211;inescapably&#8211;corporate reputation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most profound changes in business and society is the emergence of the post-Millennial generation, Gen Z.  While every new generation has faced its share of disruption in technology, economics, politics and society, no other generation in the history of mankind has had the ability to connect every human being on the planet to each other and in the process to provide the opportunity for each person to be fully educated, socially and economically engaged.  What might this mean for business, markets, and educational institutions in the future? In this revolutionary new book, The Gen Z Effect: The Six Forces Shaping the Future of Business, authors Tom Koulopoulos and Dan Keldsen delve into a vision of the future where disruptive invention and reinvention is the acknowledged norm, touching almost every aspect of how we work, live and play. From radical new approaches to marketing and manufacturing to the potential obliteration of intellectual property and the shift to mass innovation, to the decimation of our oldest learning institutions through open source and adaptive learning, The Gen Z Effect provides a mind-bending view of why we will need to embrace Gen Z as the last, best hope for taking on the world&#8217;s biggest challenges and opportunities, and how you can prepare yourself and your business for the greatest era of disruption, prosperity, and progress the world has ever experienced.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scaling up excellence is the key to creating a great organisation. It&#8217;s how a small enterprise expands without losing focus. It&#8217;s how a brilliant new idea or plan developed by the few goes on to be adopted by the many. And, in hard times and tough situations, it&#8217;s how pockets of smart new thinking overcome cultures of indifference  or negativity. An organisation that doesn&#8217;t know how to scale up what is best within it won&#8217;t achieve long-term success.     </p>
<p>                    Bestselling author Robert Sutton and his Stanford colleague Huggy Rao have devoted nearly a decade to uncovering what it takes to create and spread outstanding performance, and in Scaling Up Excellence they share the fruits of their research. Drawing on case studies that range from Silicon Valley enterprises to non-profit organisations, they provide crucial insights into corporate cultures, both good and bad, and offer a road map for establishing and stimulating excellence. In the process, they show how to use &#8216;premortems&#8217; when making big decisions about change. They reveal why seven is so often the magic number when it comes to team size. They examine successful and unsuccessful quests for improvement &#8211; in hospitals, schools and elsewhere. And they discuss when a single corporate mindset is best (&#8216;Catholicism&#8217;) and when local variation is preferable (&#8216;Buddhism&#8217;).     </p>
<p>                    Scaling Up Excellence is the first management book devoted to what is  &#8211; or should be  &#8211;  a core priority for every organisation. As such it is destined to become the standard bearer.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The current way of treating people at work has failed. Globally, only 30% of employees are engaged in their jobs, and in this fast-paced world that&#8217;s just not enough. The world&#8217;s best companies understand this, and have been quietly treating people differently for nearly two decades.     </p>
<p>                    Now you can learn their secrets and discover The Engagement Bridge (TM) model, proven to build bottom line value for companies through sustainable employee engagement.     </p>
<p>                    Companies with the best cultures generate stock market returns of twice the general market and enjoy half the employee turnover of their peers. Their staff innovate more, deliver better customer service and, hands-down, beat the competition. These companies outperform and disrupt their markets. They break the rules of traditional HR, they rebel against the status quo.     </p>
<p>                    Build it has found these rebels and the rulebreakers. From small startups to global powerhouses, this book shows that courage, commitment, and a people-centric mindset, rather than money and resources, are what you need to turn an average business into a category leader.     </p>
<p>                    The book follows the clear and proven Engagement Bridge (TM) model, developed from working with thousands of leading companies worldwide on their own employee engagement journeys. The practical model highlights the areas that leaders need to examine in order to build a highly engaged company culture and provides a framework for success.     </p>
<p>                    Build it is packed with tips, tools and real-life examples from employers including NASDAQ, Unilever, IBM, KPMG, 3M, and McDonald&#8217;s to help you start doing this not tomorrow, but today. Readers will learn:     </p>
<p>                    How employee engagement helps companies perform<br />
                    The key factors that drive engagement, and how they work together<br />
                    What the world&#8217;s most rebellious companies have done to break the rules of traditional HR and improve engagement<br />
                    How to implement The Engagement BridgeTM model to boost productivity, innovation, and better decision-making    </p>
<p>                     Unique in this category, Build it is written from two sharply different perspectives. Glenn Elliott is a multi-award winning Entrepreneur of the Year, CEO and growth investor. He talks candidly about the mistakes and missteps he has made whilst building Reward Gateway into a $300m category leader in employee engagement technology.     </p>
<p>                    Debra Corey brings 30 years experience in senior level HR roles at global companies such as Gap, Quintiles, Honeywell and Merlin Entertainments. She shares the practical tools and case studies that can kickstart your employee engagement plan, bringing her own pragmatic and engaging style to each situation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The revolutionary book that teaches you how to use the cutting edge of human psychology to build high performing workplace cultures.  Too often, great cultures feel like magic. While most leaders believe culture is critical to success, few know how to build one, or sustain it over time.  What if you knew the science behind the magic-a science so predictive and powerful that you could transform your organization? What if you could use cutting edge psychology to unlock people&#8217;s innate desire to innovate, experiment, and adapt? In Primed to Perform, Neel Doshi and Lindsay McGregor show you how to do just that. The result: higher sales, more loyal customers, and more passionate employees.  Primed to Perform explains the counter-intuitive science behind great cultures, building on over a century of academic thinking. It shares the simple, highly predictive new measurement tool-the Total Motivation (ToMo) Factor-that enables you to measure the strength of your culture, and track improvements over time. It explores the authors&#8217; original research into how Total Motivation leads to higher performance in iconic companies, from Apple to Starbucks to Southwest Airlines.<br />
                    Most importantly, it teaches you to build great cultures, using a systematic and sustainable approach.  High performing cultures cant be left to chance. Organizations must create systems that shape and maintain them. Whether you&#8217;re a five-person team or a startup, a school, a nonprofit or a mega-institution, Primed to Perform shows you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This worldwide bestseller offers simple guidance for building the kind of open and trusting relationships vital for tackling global systemic challenges and developing adaptive, innovative organizations&#8211;over 200,000 copies sold and translated into seventeen languages!     </p>
<p>                    We live, say Edgar and Peter Schein, in a culture of &#8220;tell.&#8221; All too often we tell others what we think they need to know or should do. But whether we are leading or following, what matters most is we get to the truth. We have to develop a commitment to sharing vital facts and identifying faulty assumptions&#8211;it can mean the difference between success and failure. This is why we need Humble Inquiry more than ever.     </p>
<p>                    The Scheins define Humble Inquiry as &#8220;the gentle art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building relationships based on curiosity and interest in the other person.&#8221; It was inspired by Edgar&#8217;s twenty years of work in high-hazard industries and the health-care system, where honest communication can literally mean the difference between life and death.     </p>
<p>                    In this new edition the authors look at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offer examples of it in action, and show how to overcome the barriers that keep us telling when we should be asking. This edition offers a deepening and broadening of this concept, seeing it as not just a way of posing questions but an entire attitude that includes better listening, better responding to what others are trying to tell us, and better revealing of ourselves. Packed with case examples and a full chapter of exercises and simulations, this is a major contribution to how we see human conversational dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, and eminently practical way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do James Bond and Lipitor have in common? Why do traffic jams appear out of nowhere on highways? What can we learn about innovation from a glass of water? In Loonshots, physicist and entrepreneur Safi Bahcall reveals a surprising new way of thinking about the mysteries of group behaviour and the challenges of nurturing radical breakthroughs.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the science of phase transitions, Bahcall shows why teams, companies, or any group with a mission will suddenly change from embracing wild new ideas to rigidly rejecting them, just as flowing water will suddenly change into brittle ice. Oceans of print have been written about culture. Loonshots identifies the small shifts in structure that control this transition, the same way that temperature controls the change from water to ice.    </p>
<p>                    Using examples that range from the spread of fires in forests to the hunt for terrorists online, and stories of thieves and geniuses and kings, Bahcall shows how this new kind of science helps us understand the fate of companies and empires. Loonshots distills these insights into lessons for creatives, entrepreneurs, and visionaries everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    Over the past decade, researchers have been applying the tools and techniques of phase transitions to understand how birds flock, fish swim, brains work, people vote, criminals behave, ideas spread, diseases erupt, and ecosystems collapse. If twentieth-century science was shaped by the search for fundamental laws, like quantum mechanics and gravity, the twenty-first will be shaped by this new kind of science. Loonshots is the first to apply this science to help all of us unlock our potential to create and nurture the crazy ideas that change the world.</p>

This how-to guidebook shows readers how powerful stories can help define culture and values, engender creativity and innovation, foster collaboration, build relationships, provide coaching and feedback, and lead change.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a Foreword by Jim Cora, former Chairman of Disneyland International    </p>
<p>                      &#8220;A leadership blueprint, applicable in any organization.&#8221; &#8212;  Captain D. Michael Abrashoff, U.S. Navy (Ret.), and author of It&#8217;s Your Ship    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;When I first arrived at The Walt Disney Company, I was surprised to find I had to go back to school&#8211;at Disney University! There, I learned the fundamentals of guest service that consistently gave Disney a tremendous advantage in the marketplace. Now, anyone can know these secrets of success thanks to Doug Lipp&#8217;s informative book. No matter what your business, the lessons taught at DisneyUniversity will prove invaluable.&#8221; &#8212; Michael Eisner, Former CEO and Chairman, The Walt Disney Company    </p>
<p>                    When it comes to world-class employees, few organizations rival Disney. Famous for their friendliness, knowledge, passion, and superior customer service, Disney&#8217;s employees have been fueling the iconic brand&#8217;s wild success for more than 50 years.    </p>
<p>                    How has Disney succeeded in maintaining such a powerful workforce for so many years? Why are so many corporations and executives drawn to study how Disney continues to exemplify service and leadership standards?    </p>
<p>                    The Disney University, founded by Van France, trains the supporting cast that helps create the world-famous Disney Magic. Now, for the first time, the secrets of this exemplary institution are revealed. In Disney U, Doug Lipp examines how Van perpetuated Walt Disney&#8217;s timeless company values and leadership lessons, creating a training and development dynasty. It contains never-before-told stories from numerous Disney legends. These pioneers share behind-the-scenes success stories of how they helped bring Walt Disney&#8217;s dream to life.    </p>
<p>                    Disney U reveals the heart of the Disney culture and describes the company&#8217;s values and operational philosophies that support the iconic brand. Doug Lipp lays out 13 timeless lessons Disney has used to drive profits and growth worldwide for more than half a century.    </p>
<p>                    To this day, the Disney University continues to turn out some of the most engaged, loyal, and customer-centered employees the business world has ever seen. Using the lessons outlined in Disney U will set your organization on a path of sustained success.    </p>
<p>                    PRAISE FOR Disney U:    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I highly recommend Disney U to anyone interested in building an enduring market presence and brand.&#8221; &#8212; Stephen Cannon, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mercedes-Benz USA    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Lipp&#8217;s narratives reveal how Van and other Disney visionaries set the stage for a world-class organization by skillfully balancing both &#8216;people&#8217; and &#8216;technology.'&#8221; &#8212; Debi Aubee, Vice President of Sales, Bose Corporation    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Every leader should have the equivalent of a Van France at his or her side. Thanks to Doug Lipp, we can now tap into the brilliance of a man who helped Walt createThe Happiest Place on Earth.&#8221; &#8212; David Overton, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, The Cheesecake Factory    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;How does Disney University create such enthusiastic, loyal, and customer-centered employees, year after year? Now, for the first time, Doug Lipp takes us on a journey backstage to answer this pivotal question.&#8221; &#8212; John G. Veres III, Ph.D., Chancellor, Auburn University at Montgomery    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To compete with today&#8217;s increasing globalization and rapidly evolving technologies, individuals and organizations must take their ability to learn-the foundation for continuous improvement, operational excellence, and innovation-to a much higher level. In Learn or Die, Edward D. Hess combines recent advances in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, and education with key research on high-performance businesses to create an actionable blueprint for becoming a leading-edge learning organization. Learn or Die examines the process of learning from an individual and an organizational standpoint. From an individual perspective, the book discusses the cognitive, emotional, motivational, attitudinal, and behavioral factors that promote better learning. Organizationally, Learn or Die focuses on the kinds of structures, culture, leadership, employee learning behaviors, and human resource policies that are necessary to create an environment that enables critical and innovative thinking, learning conversations, and collaboration.<br />
                    The volume also provides strategies to mitigate the reality that humans can be reflexive, lazy thinkers who seek confirmation of what they believe to be true and affirmation of their self-image. Exemplar learning organizations discussed include the secretive Bridgewater Associates, LP; Intuit, Inc.; United Parcel Service (UPS); W. L. Gore &#038; Associates; and IDEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if you could combine the agility, adaptability, and cohesion of a small team with the power and resources of a giant organization?    </p>
<p>                    When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Iraq in 2003, he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment and training &#8211; but none of the enemy&#8217;s speed and flexibility.    </p>
<p>                    McChrystal and his colleagues discarded a century of conventional wisdom to create a &#8216;team of teams&#8217; that combined extremely transparent communication with decentralized decision-making authority.     </p>
<p>                    Faster, flatter and more flexible, the task force beat back al-Qaeda.    </p>
<p>                    In this powerful book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be relevant to any leader. Through compelling examples, the authors demonstrate that the &#8216;team of teams&#8217; strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency rooms to NASA and has the potential to transform organizations large and small.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A 2018 Nautilus Book Award Winner for Business and Leadership!     </p>
<p>                    The founder of Menlo Innovations and author of the business culture cult classic Joy, Inc offers an inspirational guide to leaders seeking joy in the challenge of leading others.     </p>
<p>                    Rich Sheridan&#8217;s Joy, Inc. told the story of how his tiny software company in Ann Arbor, Michigan achieved success and renown by embracing offbeat culture and human-centered values. In Chief Joy Officer,  he turns his attention from culture to leadership, and draws on his experience running Menlo and consulting elsewhere to offer a wise, provocative guide on how anyone can build leadership capacity for joy within their own organization.     </p>
<p>                    Chief Joy Officer offers sage, hard-won advice to any manager or leader who yearns to make more of an impact on the lives of others, including:     </p>
<p>                     * Self-understanding is the cornerstone for every virtue of leadership: authenticity, trust, humility, and optimism.     </p>
<p>                     * Good leaders make more leaders: Learn to judge your performance not on whether people are doing what they&#8217;re told, but whether they&#8217;re developing independent leadership capacity.     </p>
<p>                     * Influencing up is just as important is influencing down: how to encourage different thinking in those above you in your organizations.     </p>
<p>                    Filled with colorful anecdotes from Sheridan&#8217;s personal journey and wisdom from many leadership mentors, Chief Joy Officer offers an approachable, down-to-earth philosophy and practice that will help even the most disillusioned of middle managers bring a renewed sense of purpose to their work building others.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over decades of consulting with corporations and the people who run them and 30 years teaching MBA students the nuances of organisational power, Jeffrey Pfeffer has watched numerous people suffer career reversals even as others prevail despite the odds. The most common mistake: most of us don&#8217;t have a realistic understanding of what makes some people more successful than others. We tend to subscribe to the just world phenomenon, believing that life is fair, rendering us unprepared for the challenges and competition of the real world. Now, Pfeffer brings decades of research and incredible insights to a wide audience. Brimming with counterintuitive advice, numerous examples from a variety of countries, and surprising but research-based findings, his groundbreaking guide reveals the strategies and tactics that separate the winners from the losers. Power, he argues, is a force that can be used and harnessed for individual gain, but also for the benefit of organisations and society. Power, however, cannot be learned from those in charge &#8211; their advice often puts a rosy spin on their ascent and focuses on what should have worked, rather than what did.<br />
                    Instead, he reveals the actual paths to power and career success. Iconoclastic and grounded in the realpolitik of human interaction, &#8220;Power&#8221; is an essential organisational survival manual and a new standard in the field of leadership and management.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For readers of Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, and Freakonomics, comes a captivating and surprising journey through the science of workplace excellence.    </p>
<p>                     Why do successful companies reward failure?<br />
                     What can casinos teach us about building a happy workplace?<br />
                     How do you design an office that enhances both attention to detail and creativity?     </p>
<p>                     In The Best Place to Work, award-winning psychologist Ron Friedman, Ph.D. uses the latest research from the fields of motivation, creativity, behavioral economics, neuroscience, and management to reveal what really makes us successful at work. Combining powerful stories with cutting edge findings, Friedman shows leaders at every level how they can use scientifically-proven techniques to promote smarter thinking, greater innovation, and stronger performance.     </p>
<p>                     Among the many surprising insights, Friedman explains how learning to think like a hostage negotiator can help you diffuse a workplace argument, why placing a fish bowl near your desk can elevate your thinking, and how incorporating strategic distractions into your schedule can help you reach smarter decisions. Along the way, the book introduces the inventor who created the cubicle, the president who brought down the world&#8217;s most dangerous criminal, and the teenager who single-handedly transformed professional tennis&#8211;vivid stories that offer unexpected revelations on achieving workplace excellence.     </p>
<p>                     Brimming with counterintuitive insights and actionable recommendations, The Best Place to Work offers employees and executives alike game-changing advice for working smarter and turning any organization&#8211;regardless of its size, budgets, or ambitions&#8211;into an extraordinary workplace.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Research Shows Organizations That Focus on Employee Experience Far Outperform Those That Don&#8217;t Recently a new type of organization has emerged, one that focuses on employee experiences as a way to drive innovation, increase customer satisfaction, find and hire the best people, make work more engaging, and improve overall performance. The Employee Experience Advantage is the first book of its kind to tackle this emerging topic that is becoming the #1 priority for business leaders around the world. Although everyone talks about employee experience nobody has really been able to explain concretely what it is and how to go about designing for it&#8230;until now. How can organizations truly create a place where employees want to show up to work versus need to show up to work? For decades the business world has focused on measuring employee engagement meanwhile global engagement scores remain at an all time low despite all the surveys and institutes that been springing up tackle this problem. Clearly something is not working. Employee engagement has become the short-term adrenaline shot that organizations turn to when they need to increase their engagement scores.<br />
                    Instead, we have to focus on designing employee experiences which is the long term organizational design that leads to engaged employees. This is the only long-term solution. Organizations have been stuck focusing on the cause instead of the effect. The cause is employee experience; the effect is an engaged workforce. Backed by an extensive research project that looked at over 150 studies and articles, featured extensive interviews with over 150 executives, and analyzed over 250 global organizations, this book clearly breaks down the three environments that make up every single employee experience at every organization around the world and how to design for them. These are the cultural, technological, and physical environments. This book explores the attributes that organizations need to focus on in each one of these environments to create COOL spaces, ACE technology, and a CELEBRATED culture. Featuring exclusive case studies, unique frameworks, and never before seen research, The Employee Experience Advantage guides readers on a journey of creating a place where people actually want to show up to work.<br />
                    Readers will learn: * The trends shaping employee experience * How to evaluate their own employee experience using the Employee Experience Score * What the world&#8217;s leading organizations are doing around employee experience * How to design for technology, culture, and physical spaces * The role people analytics place in employee experience * Frameworks for how to actually create employee experiences * The role of the gig economy * The future of employee experience * Nine types of organizations that focus on employee experience * And much more! There is no question that engaged employees perform better, aspire higher, and achieve more, but you can&#8217;t create employee engagement without designing employee experiences first. It&#8217;s time to rethink your strategy and implement a real-world framework that focuses on how to create an organization where people want to show up to work. The Employee Experience Advantage shows you how to do just that.</p>

<p>                    In business, performance is key. In performance, how you organize can be the key to growth.    </p>
<p>                    In the past five years, the business world has seen the birth of a new breed of company-the Exponential Organization-that has revolutionized how a company can accelerate its growth by using technology. An ExO can eliminate the incremental, linear way traditional companies get bigger, leveraging assets like community, big data, algorithms, and new technology into achieving performance benchmarks ten times better than its peers.    </p>
<p>                    Three luminaries of the business world-Salim Ismail, Yuri van Geest, and Mike Malone-have researched this phenomenon and documented ten characteristics of Exponential Organizations. Here, in EXPONENTIAL ORGANIZATIONS, they walk the reader through how any company, from a startup to a multi-national, can become an ExO, streamline its performance, and grow to the next level.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fun, interesting, and useful read!&#8217; David Allen, bestselling author of Getting Things Done    </p>
<p>                    Nearly all of us want to be more productive, but finding the method that works for you among the hundreds and hundreds of different tips, tricks and hacks can be a daunting prospect. After graduating college, Chris Bailey decided to dedicate a whole year to doing just that &#8211; experimenting with as many of the techniques as he could, and finding the things that work. Among the experiments that he undertook are: going several weeks on little to no sleep; cutting out caffeine and sugar; taking a daily siesta; living in total isolation for 10 days; stretching his workweek to 90 hours; and getting up at 5:30 every morning,  all the while monitoring the impact of his experiments on the quality and quantity of his work. The results were often surprising!     </p>
<p>                    This book is the result of Chris&#8217;s year-long journey, distilling the lessons he learned into a few core truths about how we get things done (or, indeed, don&#8217;t).  Among the many counterintuitive insights Chris discovered that had the biggest impact on his productivity were striving for imperfection; scheduling less time for important tasks; the 20 second rule to distract yourself from distractions; and the concept of productive procrastination.     </p>
<p>                    In this accessible and fun guide, Chris Bailey offers over 30 tried-and-tested best practices that will help everyone to accomplish more &#8211; and become more awesome.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day &#8212; as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?     </p>
<p>                    Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In one survey, 61 percent of employees said that workplace stress had made them sick and 7 percent said they had actually been hospitalized. Job stress costs US employers more than $300 billion annually and may cause 120,000 excess deaths each year. In China, 1 million people a year may be dying from overwork. People are literally dying for a paycheck. And it needs to stop.    </p>
<p>                    In this timely, provocative book, Jeffrey Pfeffer contends that many modern management commonalities such as long work hours, work-family conflict, and economic insecurity are toxic to employees&#8211;hurting engagement, increasing turnover, and destroying people&#8217;s physical and emotional health&#8211;and also inimical to company performance. He argues that human sustainability should be as important as environmental stewardship.    </p>
<p>                    You don&#8217;t have to do a physically dangerous job to confront a health-destroying, possibly life-threatening, workplace. Just ask the manager in a senior finance role whose immense workload, once handled by several employees, required frequent all-nighters&#8211;leading to alcohol and drug addiction. Or the dedicated news media producer whose commitment to getting the story resulted in a sixty-pound weight gain thanks to having no down time to eat properly or exercise. Or the marketing professional prescribed antidepressants a week after joining her employer.    </p>
<p>                    In Dying for a Paycheck, Jeffrey Pfeffer marshals a vast trove of evidence and numerous examples from all over the world to expose the infuriating truth about modern work life: even as organizations allow management practices that literally sicken and kill their employees, those policies do not enhance productivity or the bottom line, thereby creating a lose-lose situation.    </p>
<p>                    Exploring a range of important topics including layoffs, health insurance, work-family conflict, work hours, job autonomy, and why people remain in toxic environments, Pfeffer offers guidance and practical solutions all of us&#8211;employees, employers, and the government&#8211;can use to enhance workplace wellbeing. We must wake up to the dangers and enormous costs of today&#8217;s workplace, Pfeffer argues. Dying for a Paycheck is a clarion call for a social movement focused on human sustainability. Pfeffer makes clear that the environment we work in is just as important as the one we live in, and with this urgent book, he opens our eyes and shows how we can make our workplaces healthier and better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever  since civilised society began, we have felt the need to classify,  categorise and specialise. It can make things more efficient, and help  give the leaders of any organisation a sense of confidence that they  have the right people focusing on the right tasks. But it can also be  catastrophic, leading to tunnel vision and tribalism. Most importantly  it can create a structural fog, with the full picture of where an  organisation is heading hidden from view. It is incredibly widespread:  the chances are these &#8216;silos&#8217; are rife in any organisation or  profession, whether your business, or your local school or hospital.    </p>
<p>                    Across  industries and cultures, as this brilliant and penetrating book shows,  silos have the power to collapse companies and destabilise financial  markets, yet they still dominate the workplace. They blind and confuse  us, often making modern institutions act in risky, silly and damaging  ways.    </p>
<p>                    Gillian Tett has spent years covering financial markets and  business, but she&#8217;s also a trained anthropologist, having completed a  doctorate at Cambridge University and conducted field work in Tibet and  Tajikistan. She&#8217;s no stranger to questioning the assumptions and  practices of a culture. Those in question &#8211; financial trading desks,  urban police forces, surgical teams within medical clinics, software  debuggers and consumer product engineers &#8211; have practices and rituals as  ordered and intricate as those of any far-flung tribe.    </p>
<p>                    In The Silo Effect,  she uses an anthropological lens to explore how individuals, teams and  whole organisations often work in silos of thought, process and product.  With examples drawn from a range of fascinating areas &#8211; the New York  Fire Department and Facebook to the Bank of England and Sony &#8211; these  narratives illustrate not just how foolishly people can behave when they  are mastered by silos but also how the brightest institutions and  individuals can master them. The Silo Effect is a sharp,  visionary and inspiring work with the insight, prescriptions and power  to remove our organisational blinders and transform the way we think for  the better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 20th anniversary edition of Now, Discover Your Strengths comes with an access code to the Clifton StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment. This updated assessment includes reports and resources that go far beyond the standardized reports of the older assessment by providing you with personalized insight statements unique to your specific combination of strengths.    </p>
<p>                    Many people have little sense of their talents and strengths, much less the ability to build their lives around them. Instead, they are raised and taught to become experts in their weaknesses-and spend their lives trying to fix them-while their strengths lie dormant.    </p>
<p>                    Led by Don Clifton, the Father of Strengths-Based Psychology, Gallup created a revolutionary program to help people identify their talents; develop them into strengths; and enjoy consistent, near-perfect performance. Twenty years ago, Gallup released Now, Discover Your Strengths to bring this program to the world.    </p>
<p>                    At the heart of this book is CliftonStrengths, the assessment that is the product of decades of research and hundreds of thousands of interviews to identify the most prevalent human strengths. CliftonStrengths reveals 34 dominant talent themes that you can translate into personal and career success. To develop this assessment, Gallup conducted psychological profiles with more than 2 million individuals to help people around the world focus and perfect these themes. Since Now, Discover Your Strengths was first released two decades ago, more than 20 million people worldwide have taken the CliftonStrengths assessment.    </p>
<p>                    The 20th anniversary edition includes a unique access code to take CliftonStrengths-previously known as StrengthsFinder 2.0-which is a significantly more robust program than the assessment that appeared in the original edition of the book. This web-based assessment analyzes your instinctive reactions and immediately presents you with your top five themes.    </p>
<p>                    Once you know which of the 34 themes you lead with-such as Achiever, Activator, Empathy, Futuristic and Strategic-the book will show you how to use your top themes for your own development, for your success as a manager and for the success of your organization.    </p>
<p>                    With accessible and profound insights into how to turn talents into strengths, and with immediate online feedback from the CliftonStrengths assessment at its core, Now, Discover Your Strengths is one of the most ground-breaking and powerful business books ever written.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>New York Times bestselling author and award-winning educator Ron Clark applies his successful leadership principles to the business world in this effective and accessible guidebook, perfect for any manager looking to inspire and motivate his or her team. Includes a foreword by bestselling author and FranklinCovey executive Sean Covey.     </p>
<p>                    Teamwork is crucial to the success of any business, and as acclaimed author and speaker Ron Clark illustrates, the members of any team are the key to unlocking success. Imagine a company as a bus filled with people who either help or hinder a team&#8217;s ability to move it forward: drivers (who steer the organization), runners (who consistently go above and beyond for the good of the organization), joggers (who do their jobs without pushing themselves), walkers (who are just getting pulled along), and riders (who hinder success and drag the team down). It&#8217;s the team leader&#8217;s job to recognize how members fall into these categories, encourage them to keep the &#8220;bus&#8221; moving by working together, and know when it&#8217;s time to kick the riders off.     </p>
<p>                    In the tradition of Who Moved My Cheese? and Fish!, Move Your Bus is an accessible and uplifting business parable that illustrates Clark&#8217;s expert strategies to maximize the performance of each member of a team. These easy to implement techniques will inspire employees and team leaders alike to work harder and smarter and drive the organization to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Companies, communities, and individuals fall for many reasons, but one of the most common and easily avoidable is the failure to reinvent. When people and organizations rest on prior successes rather than driving purposeful transformation, they discover too late that they have lost their market position altogether to competitors and external forces. The most successful companies, brands, and individuals make reinvention a regular part of their business strategies. Transformation demands an ongoing process of discovery and imagination, and The Road to Reinvention lays out a systematic approach for continually challenging and reinventing yourself and your business. Venture capitalist and serial entrepreneur Josh Linkner identifies six elements in any business that are ripe for reinvention and shares examples, methods, and step-by-step techniques for creating deliberate, productive disruption. Throughout The Road to Reinvention, Linkner also explores the history the great rise, unprecedented fall, and now rebirth of his beloved hometown, Detroit.<br />
                    First rising to greatness as the result of breathtaking innovation, Detroit had generations of booming growth before succumbing to apathy, atrophy, and finally bankruptcy. Now, the city is rising from the ashes and driving sustainable success through an intense focus on reinvention. Linkner brings an insider&#8217;s view of this incredible story of grit, determination, and creativity, sharing his perspective on Detroit&#8217;s successes and setbacks as a profound example of large-scale organizational and personal transformation. Change is inevitable. You need to decide: Will you drive that change, or be driven away by it? Will you disrupt or be disrupted? By choosing to deliberately reimagine your own status quo, you can secure a strong future for both your company and your career.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Segall put the &#8216;i&#8217; in iPad. Now he explains why simplicity is the secret of Apple&#8217;s success in Insanely Simple.    </p>
<p>                    To Steve Jobs, Simplicity wasn&#8217;t just a design principle. It was a religion and a weapon. The obsession with Simplicity is what separates Apple from other technology companies. It&#8217;s what helped Apple recover from near death in 1997 to become the most valuable company on Earth in 2011, and guides the way Apple is organized, how it designs products, and how it connects with customers. It&#8217;s by crushing the forces of Complexity that the company remains on its stellar trajectory.    </p>
<p>                    As creative director, Ken Segall played a key role in Apple&#8217;s resurrection, helping to create such critical campaigns as &#8216;Think Different&#8217; and naming the iMac. Insanely Simple is his insider&#8217;s view of Jobs&#8217; world. It reveals the ten elements of Simplicity that have driven Apple&#8217;s success &#8211; which you can use to propel your own organisation. Reading Insanely Simple, you&#8217;ll be a fly on the wall inside a conference room with Steve Jobs, and on the receiving end of his midnight phone calls. You&#8217;ll understand how his obsession with Simplicity helped Apple perform better and faster.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A blueprint for running a company the Steve Jobs way &#8230; should be required reading for anyone interested in management and marketing&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Punchy &#8230; Segall gets inside Apple&#8217;s branding and marketing to explain its directness and power&#8217;  Financial Times     </p>
<p>                    Ken Segall worked closely with Steve Jobs as ad agency creative director for NeXT and Apple. He was a member of the team that created Apple&#8217;s legendary &#8216;Think Different&#8217; campaign, and he&#8217;s responsible for that little &#8220;i&#8221; that&#8217;s a part of Apple&#8217;s most popular products. Segall has also served as creative director for IBM, Intel, Dell, and BMW. He blogs about technology and marketing at kensegall.com/blog, and has fun with it all at scoopertino.com.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent estimate suggests that employees endure a staggering 55 million meetings a day in the United States. This tremendous time investment yields only modest returns. No organization made up of human beings is immune from the all-too-common meeting gripes: those that fail to engage, those that inadvertently encourage participants to tune out, and those that blatantly disregard participants&#8217; time.     </p>
<p>                    Most companies and leaders view poor meetings as an inevitable cost of doing business. But managers can take heart: researchers now have a clear understanding of the key drivers that make meetings successful. In The Surprising Science of Meetings, Steven G. Rogelberg, researcher and consultant to some of the world&#8217;s most successful companies, draws from extensive research, analytics and data mining, and survey interviews with over 5,000 employees across a range of industries to share<br />
                    the proven practices and techniques that help managers and employees enhance the quality of their meetings. For those who lead and participate in meetings, Rogelberg provides immediate direction, guidance, and relief, offering a how-to guide to change your working life starting today.</p>

<p>                    USA Today Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    We are living in a world in which cows send texts to farmers when they&#8217;re in heat, where the most valuable real estate in New York City houses computers, not people, and some of humanity&#8217;s greatest works are created by crowds, not individuals.     </p>
<p>                    We are in the midst of a networking revolution&#8211;set to transform the way we access the world&#8217;s information and the way we connect with one another. Studying biological systems is perhaps the best way to understand such networks, and nature has a lesson for us if we care to listen: bigger is rarely better in the long run. The deadliest creature is the mosquito, not the lion. It is the quality of a network that is important for survival, not the size, and all networks&#8211;the human brain, Facebook, Google, even the internet itself&#8211;eventually reach a breakpoint and collapse. That&#8217;s the bad news. The good news is that reaching a breakpoint can be a step forward, allowing a network to substitute quality for quantity.     </p>
<p>                    In Breakpoint, brain scientist and entrepreneur Jeff Stibel takes readers to the intersection of the brain, biology, and technology. He shows how exceptional companies are using their understanding of the internet&#8217;s brain-like powers to create a competitive advantage by building more effective websites, utilizing cloud computing, engaging social media, monetizing effectively, and leveraging a collective consciousness. Indeed, the result of these technologies is a more tightly connected world with capabilities far beyond the sum of our individual minds. Breakpoint offers a fresh and exciting perspective about the future of technology and its effects on all of us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What&#8217;s worse than a bad manager who everybody knows is bad? A bad manager who is well-intentioned and considered to be good. Yet these well-intentioned bad managers make up the bulk of management today. How did that happen? How did so many of today&#8217;s managers end up with a self-preservation mindset that doesn&#8217;t  always translate to a productive and mission-oriented environment? How did so many good people become wedded to a work culture that saps morale, well-being<br />
                    and performance at both the individual and organizational levels?     </p>
<p>                    an the well-intentioned doling it out realize&#8230; and even In Good People, Bad Managers: How Work Culture Corrupts Good Intentions, author Samuel A. Culbert sheds a light on the bad habits that are routinely followed by these well-intended managers. Managers need to understand the causes of their misguided practices. They need to become more aware of the damage they inflict, and the hollowness of the rationales they use to justify what they do. Company leaders, CEOs, and top-tier<br />
                    managers must become aware of how they have gone astray as a first step in implementing the truly beneficial management mentality that their companies, their managers and their employees require to succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When the Harvard Business Review asked Robert Sutton for suggestions for its annual list of Breakthrough Ideas, he told them that the best business practice he knew of was &#8216;the no asshole rule&#8217;. Sutton&#8217;s piece became one of the most popular articles ever to appear in the HBR. Spurred on by the fear and despair that people expressed, the tricks they used to survive with dignity in asshole-infested places, the revenge stories that made him laugh out loud and the other small wins that they celebrated against mean-spirited people, Sutton was persuaded to write THE NO ASSHOLE RULE.<br />
                    He believes passionately that civilised workplaces are not a naive dream, that they do exist, do bolster performance and that widespread contempt can be erased and replaced with mutual respect when a team or organisation is managed right. There is a huge temptation by executives and those in positions of authority to overlook this trait especially when exhibited by so-called producers, but Sutton shows how overall productivity suffers when the workplace is subjected to this kind of stress.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Habits are more powerful than your will &#8211; if you know how to make them work for you    </p>
<p>                    Two strings are hanging from a ceiling, one at the centre of the room, one near the wall. You&#8217;re asked to tie the strings together, but you can&#8217;t reach both at the same time. You look around the room and see a table and a pair of pliers. How would you solve the problem?    </p>
<p>                    When confronted with challenges, most people let habits rule them (in this case, ignoring the pliers, the creative tool at your disposal). That is not surprising when you realise that at least a third of our waking hours are lived on auto-pilot &#8211; ruminating over past events, clicking through websites trawling for updates and the like. Such unconscious thoughts and actions are powerful. But the habits of the mind do not have to control us &#8211; we can steer them.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on hundreds of fascinating studies, psychologist Jeremy Dean &#8211; the mind behind the hugely popular and insightful website PsyBlog &#8211; shares how the new brain science of habit can be harnessed to your benefit, whether you&#8217;re hoping to eat moreveg, take an evening run, clear out your email backlog, or be more creative when faced with challenges at work and at home.</p>

<p>                     Winner of the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award     </p>
<p>                     Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world&#8211;our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment&#8211;is largely driven by the mind&#8217;s subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events&#8211;along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Early in the twenty-first century, a quiet revolution occurred. For the first time, the major developed economies began to invest more in intangible assets, like design, branding, and software, than in tangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers. For all sorts of businesses, the ability to deploy assets that one can neither see nor touch is increasingly the main source of long-term success. But this is not just a familiar story of the so-called new economy. Capitalism without Capital shows that the growing importance of intangible assets has also played a role in some of the larger economic changes of the past decade, including the growth in economic inequality and the stagnation of productivity. Jonathan Haskel and Stian Westlake explore the unusual economic characteristics of intangible investment and discuss how an economy rich in intangibles is fundamentally different from one based on tangibles. Capitalism without Capital concludes by outlining how managers, investors, and policymakers can exploit the characteristics of an intangible age to grow their businesses, portfolios, and economies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Set aside trends to focus on the fundamentals of great leadership Reframing Organizations provides time-tested guidance for more effective organizational leadership. Rooted in decades of social science research across multiple disciplines, Bolman and Deal&#8217;s four-frame model has continued to evolve since its conception over 25 years ago; this new sixth edition has been updated to include coverage of cross-sector collaboration, generational differences, virtual environments, globalization, sustainability, and communication across cultures. The Instructor&#8217;s guide has been expanded to provide additional tools for the classroom, including chapter summary tip sheets, mini-assessments, Bolman &#038; Deal podcasts, and more. These recent revisions reflect the intersection of reader recommendations and the current leadership environment, resulting in a renewed practicality and even greater alignment with everyday application. Combining the latest research from organizational theory, organizational behavior, psychology, sociology, political science and more, the model detailed here provides real guidance for real leaders.<br />
                    Guide, motivate, and inspire your team&#8217;s best performance as you learn to: * Optimize group, team, and organizational structure * Build a positive, collaborative dynamic across generations, teams, and sectors * Understand power and conflict amidst the internal and external political landscape * Shape your organization&#8217;s culture and build a cohesive sense of spirit Bolman and Deal&#8217;s four-frame model has withstood the test of time because it offers an accessible, compact, and powerful set of ideas for navigating complexity and turbulence. In today&#8217;s business climate, leadership trends come and go; today&#8217;s flash in the pan is tomorrow&#8217;s obsolete strategy, but a leadership framework built on a solid foundation will serve your organization well no matter what the future holds. Reframing Organizations provides clear guidance and up-to-date insight for anyone facing the challenges of contemporary leadership.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Red teaming. It is a practice as old as the Devil&#8217;s Advocate, the eleventh-century Vatican official charged with discrediting candidates for sainthood. Today, red teams,comprised primarily of fearless skeptics and those assuming the role of saboteurs who seek to better understand the interests, intentions, and capabilities of institutions or potential competitors,are used widely in both the public and private sector. Red teaming, including simulations, vulnerability probes, and alternative analyses, helps institutions in competitive environments to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses, challenge assumptions, and anticipate potential threats ahead of the next special operations raid, malicious cyberattack, or corporate merger. But not all red teams are created equal indeed, some cause more damage than they prevent. In  Red Team , national security expert Micah Zenko provides an in-depth investigation into the work of red teams, revealing the best practices, most common pitfalls, and most effective applications of these modern-day Devil&#8217;s Advocates. The best practices of red teaming can be applied to the CIA, NYPD, or a pharmaceutical company, and executed correctly they can yield impressive results: red teams give businesses an edge over their competition, poke holes in vital intelligence estimates, and troubleshoot dangerous military missions long before boots are on the ground. But red teams are only as good as leaders allow them to be, and Zenko shows not only how to create and empower red teams, but also what to do with the information they produce.Essential reading for business leaders and policymakers alike,  Red Team  will revolutionize the way organizations think about, exploit, compensate for, and correct their institutional strengths and weaknesses. Drawing on little-known case studies and unprecedented access to elite red teamers in the United States and abroad, Zenko shows how any group,from military units to friendly hackers,can win by thinking like the enemy.</p>

It produces sustainable, exceptional performance through the solidarity of its community and the dignity of each member.    </p>
<p>                    Conscious Business presents breakthrough techniques to help you achieve:    </p>
<p>                    Unconditional responsibility-how to become the main character of your life<br />
                    * Unflinching integrity-how to succeed beyond success<br />
                    * Authentic communication-how to speak your truth, and elicit others&#8217; truths<br />
                    * Impeccable commitments-how to coordinate actions with accountability<br />
                    * Right leadership-how being, rather than doing, is the ultimate source of excellence<br />
                    A conscious business fosters personal fulfillment in the individuals, mutual respect in the community, and success in the organization, teaches Fred Kofman. Conscious Business is the definitive resource for achieving what really matters in the workplace and beyond.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Andy Grove, founder and former CEO of Intel shares his strategy for success as he takes the reader deep inside the workings of a major company in Only the Paranoid Survive.     </p>
<p>                    Under Andy Grove&#8217;s leadership, Intel became the world&#8217;s largest chip maker and one of the most admired companies in the world. In Only the Paranoid Survive, Grove reveals his strategy for measuring the nightmare moment every leader dreads&#8211;when massive change occurs and a company must, virtually overnight, adapt or fall by the wayside&#8211;in a new way.     </p>
<p>                    Grove calls such a moment a Strategic Inflection Point, which can be set off by almost anything: mega-competition, a change in regulations, or a seemingly modest change in technology. When a Strategic Inflection Point hits, the ordinary rules of business go out the window. Yet, managed right, a Strategic Inflection Point can be an opportunity to win in the marketplace and emerge stronger than ever.     </p>
<p>                    Grove underscores his message by examining his own record of success and failure, including how he navigated the events of the Pentium flaw, which threatened Intel&#8217;s reputation in 1994, and how he has dealt with the explosions in growth of the Internet. The work of a lifetime, Only the Paranoid Survive is a classic of managerial and leadership skills.</p>

<p>                    What happened? The &#8220;whirlwind&#8221; of urgent activity required to keep things running day-to-day devoured all the time and energy you needed to invest in executing your strategy for tomorrow! The 4 Disciplines of Execution can change all that forever.     </p>
<p>                    The 4 Disciplines of Execution (4DX) is a simple, repeatable, and proven formula for executing on your most important strategic priorities in the midst of the whirlwind. By following The 4 Disciplines:     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Focusing on the Wildly Important<br />
                     &#8211; Acting on Lead Measures<br />
                    &#8211; Keeping a Compelling Scoreboard<br />
                     &#8211; Creating a Cadence of Accountability     </p>
<p>                    leaders can produce breakthrough results, even when executing the strategy requires a significant change in behavior from their teams.     </p>
<p>                    4DX is not theory. It is a proven set of practices that have been tested and refined by hundreds of organizations and thousands of teams over many years. When a company or an individual adheres to these disciplines, they achieve superb results&#8211;regardless of the goal. 4DX represents a new way of thinking and working that is essential to thriving in today&#8217;s competitive climate. Simply put, this is one audiobook that no business leader can afford to miss.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conquer the most essential adaptation to the knowledge economy    </p>
<p>                     The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth offers practical guidance for teams and organizations who are serious about success in the modern economy. With so much riding on innovation, creativity, and spark, it is essential to attract and retain quality talent-but what good does this talent do if no one is able to speak their mind? The traditional culture of &#8220;fitting in&#8221; and &#8220;going along&#8221; spells doom in the knowledge economy. Success requires a continuous influx of new ideas, new challenges, and critical thought, and the interpersonal climate must not suppress, silence, ridicule or intimidate. Not every idea is good, and yes there are stupid questions, and yes dissent can slow things down, but talking through these things is an essential part of the creative process. People must be allowed to voice half-finished thoughts, ask questions from left field, and brainstorm out loud; it creates a culture in which a minor flub or momentary lapse is no big deal, and where actual mistakes are owned and corrected, and where the next left-field idea could be the next big thing.     </p>
<p>                     This book explores this culture of psychological safety, and provides a blueprint for bringing it to life. The road is sometimes bumpy, but succinct and informative scenario-based explanations provide a clear path forward to constant learning and healthy innovation.    </p>
<p>                    Explore the link between psychological safety and high performance<br />
                    Create a culture where it&#8217;s &#8220;safe&#8221; to express ideas, ask questions, and admit mistakes<br />
                    Nurture the level of engagement and candor required in today&#8217;s knowledge economy    </p>
<p>                    Follow a step-by-step framework for establishing psychological safety in your team or organization    </p>
<p>                     Shed the &#8220;yes-men&#8221; approach and step into real performance. Fertilize creativity, clarify goals, achieve accountability, redefine leadership, and much more. The Fearless Organization helps you bring about this most critical transformation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Helping is a fundamental human activity, but it can also be a frustrating one. All too often, to our bewilderment, our sincere offers of help are resented, resisted, or refused&#8211;and we often react the same way when people try to help us. Why is it so difficult to provide or accept help? How can we make the whole process easier?     </p>
<p>                     In this seminal book on the topic, corporate culture and organizational development guru Ed Schein analyzes the social and psychological dynamics common to all types of helping relationships, explains why help is often not helpful, and shows what any would-be helpers must do to ensure that their assistance is both welcomed and genuinely useful.     </p>
<p>                     The moment of asking for and offering help is a delicate and complex one, fraught with inequities and ambiguities. Schein helps us navigate that moment so we avoid potential pitfalls, mitigate power imbalances, and establish a solid foundation of trust. He identifies three roles a helper can play, explaining which one is nearly always the best starting point if we are to provide truly effective help. So that readers can determine exactly what kind of help is needed, he describes an inquiry process that puts the helper and the recipient on an equal footing. These dynamics not only apply to all kinds of one-on-one helping in personal and professional relationships, teaching, social work, and medicine but also can be usefully applied to teamwork and to organizational leadership.     </p>
<p>                     Using examples from many types of relationships&#8211;doctors and patients, consultants and clients, husbands and wives&#8211;Ed Schein offers a concise, definitive analysis of what it takes to establish successful, mutually satisfying helping relationships.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the locker room to the living room to the boardroom&#8211;how winners become winners . . . and stay that way.     </p>
<p>                    Is success simply a matter of money and talent? Or is there another reason why some people and organizations always land on their feet, while others, equally talented, stumble again and again?     </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s a fundamental principle at work-confidence-that makes the difference between winning and losing in any competition, be it a high school basketball game or a high-stakes business situation. In Confidence, Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter shows why organizations of all types may be brimming with talent but not be winners. Based on her extraordinary investigation of success and failure in companies such as Continental Airlines and Verizon and sports teams such as the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, as well as the arenas of education, health care, and politics, Kanter explores a new theory and practice of success and provides people in leadership positions with a prescriptive program for maintaining a winning streak or turning around a downward spiral.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with brilliant, practical ideas, Confidence provides fresh thinking about success in all facets of life&#8211;from the factors that can make or break corporations and governments to the keys for successful relationships in the workplace or at home.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caring Is a Competitive Advantage Suffering in the workplace can rob our colleagues and coworkers of humanity, dignity, and motivation and is an unrecognized and costly drain on organizational potential. Marshaling evidence from two decades of field research, scholars and consultants Monica Worline and Jane Dutton show that alleviating such suffering confers measurable competitive advantages in areas like innovation, collaboration, service quality, and talent attraction and retention. They outline four steps for meeting suffering with compassion and show how to build a capacity for compassion into the structures and practices of an organization-because ultimately, as they write, Compassion is an irreplaceable dimension of excellence for any organization that wants to make the most of its human capabilities.</p>

An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.  Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business-from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed-and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business.<br />
                    The E-Myth Revisited will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Marquet is the kind of leader who comes around only once in a generation &#8230; his ideas and lessons are invaluable&#8217; Simon Sinek, author of Start With Why    </p>
<p>                    Captain David Marquet was used to giving orders. In the high-stress environment of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, it was crucial his men did their job well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance and the worst retention in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    One day, Marquet unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. He realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things.     </p>
<p>                    Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Before long, his crew became fully engaged and the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet&#8217;s approach to create a workplace where everyone takes responsibility for their actions, people are healthier and happier &#8211; and everyone is a leader.    </p>
<p>                    In his latest book, Leadership is Language, Marquet builds on what he teaches in Turn the Ship Around!, showing us how to lead our teams to success through the language that we use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Instant National Bestseller     </p>
<p>                    A PBS NewsHour-New York Times Book Club Pick!     </p>
<p>                    Excellent. &#8211;San Francisco Chronicle     </p>
<p>                    Brotopia is more than a business book. Silicon Valley holds extraordinary power over our present lives as well as whatever utopia (or nightmare) might come next. &#8211;New York Times     </p>
<p>                    Silicon Valley is a modern utopia where anyone can change the world. Unless you&#8217;re a woman.     </p>
<p>                    For women in tech, Silicon Valley is not a fantasyland of unicorns, virtual reality rainbows, and 3D-printed lollipops, where millions of dollars grow on trees. It&#8217;s a Brotopia, where men hold all the cards and make all the rules. Vastly outnumbered, women face toxic workplaces rife with discrimination and sexual harassment, where investors take meetings in hot tubs and network at sex parties.     </p>
<p>                    In this powerful exposé, Bloomberg TV journalist Emily Chang reveals how Silicon Valley got so sexist despite its utopian ideals, why bro culture endures despite decades of companies claiming the moral high ground (Don&#8217;t Be Evil! Connect the World!)&#8211;and how women are finally starting to speak out and fight back.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her deep network of Silicon Valley insiders, Chang opens the boardroom doors of male-dominated venture capital firms like Kleiner Perkins, the subject of Ellen Pao&#8217;s high-profile gender discrimination lawsuit, and Sequoia, where a partner once famously said they won&#8217;t lower their standards just to hire women. Interviews with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki, and former Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer&#8211;who got their start at Google, where just one in five engineers is a woman&#8211;reveal just how hard it is to crack the Silicon Ceiling. And Chang shows how women such as former Uber engineer Susan Fowler, entrepreneur Niniane Wang, and game developer Brianna Wu, have risked their careers and sometimes their lives to pave a way for other women.     </p>
<p>                    Silicon Valley&#8217;s aggressive, misogynistic, work-at-all costs culture has shut women out of the greatest wealth creation in the history of the world. It&#8217;s time to break up the boys&#8217; club. Emily Chang shows us how to fix this toxic culture&#8211;to bring down Brotopia, once and for all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unprecedented history of the personality test conceived a century ago by a mother and her daughter&#8211;fiction writers with no formal training in psychology&#8211;and how it insinuated itself into our boardrooms, classrooms, and beyond. The basis for the HBO Max documentary, Persona    </p>
<p>                    The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It is used regularly by Fortune 500 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language of personality types&#8211;extraversion and introversion, sensing and intuiting, thinking and feeling, judging and perceiving&#8211;has inspired television shows, online dating platforms, and Buzzfeed quizzes. Yet despite the test&#8217;s widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $2 billion industry, have struggled to validate its results&#8211;no less account for its success. How did Myers-Briggs, a homegrown multiple choice questionnaire, infiltrate our workplaces, our relationships, our Internet, our lives?     </p>
<p>                    First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of devoted homemakers, novelists, and amateur psychoanalysts, Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life entirely its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was administered to some of the twentieth century&#8217;s greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo, until it could be found just as easily in elementary schools, nunneries, and wellness retreats as in shadowy political consultancies and on social networks.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, The Personality Brokers takes a critical look at the personality indicator that became a cultural icon. Along the way it examines nothing less than the definition of the self&#8211;our attempts to grasp, categorize, and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you, you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A powerful manifesto for CEOs and employees alike: Influential and award-winning business leader Margaret Heffernan reveals how organizations can build ideal workplace cultures and create seismic shifts by making deceptively small changes.     </p>
<p>                    By implementing sweeping changes, businesses often think it&#8217;s possible to do better, to earn more, and have happier employees. So why does engagement prove so difficult and productivity so elusive?     </p>
<p>                    In Beyond Measure, Margaret Heffernan looks back over her decades spent overseeing different organizations and comes to a counterintuitive conclusion: it&#8217;s the small shifts that have the greatest impact. Heffernan argues that building the strongest organization can be accelerated by implementing seemingly small changes, such as embracing conflict as a creative catalyst; using every mind on the team; celebrating mistakes; speaking up and listening more; and encouraging time off from work.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with incredible anecdotes and startling statistics, Beyond Measure takes us on a fascinating tour across the globe, highlighting disparate businesses and revealing how they&#8217;ve managed to change themselves in big ways through incremental shifts. How did the CIA revolutionize their intelligence gathering with one simple question? How did one organization increase their revenue by $15 million by instituting a short coffee break? How can a day-long hackathon change the culture of a company? Told with wry wit and knowing humor, Heffernan proves that it&#8217;s often the small changes that make the greatest, most lasting impact.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Berkshire Hathaway, the $300 billion conglomerate that Warren Buffett built, is among the world&#8217;s largest and most famous corporations. Yet, for all its power and celebrity, few people understand Berkshire, and many assume it cannot survive without Buffett. This book proves them wrong. In a comprehensive portrait of the corporate culture that unites Berkshire&#8217;s subsidiaries, Lawrence A. Cunningham unearths the traits that assure the conglomerate&#8217;s continued prosperity. Riveting stories of each subsidiary&#8217;s origins, triumphs, and journey to Berkshire reveal how managers generate economic value from intangibles like thrift, integrity, entrepreneurship, autonomy, and a sense of permanence. Rich with lessons for those wishing to profit from the Berkshire model, this engaging book is a valuable read for entrepreneurs, business owners, managers, family business members, and investors, and it is an important resource for scholars of corporate stewardship. General readers will enjoy learning how an iconoclastic businessman transformed a struggling textile company into a corporate legacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The need to understand what top-performing reps are doing that their average performing colleagues are not drove Matthew Dixon, Brent Adamson, and their colleagues at Corporate Executive Board to investigate the skills, behaviors, knowledge, and attitudes that matter most for high performance. And what they discovered may be the biggest shock to conventional sales wisdom in decades. Based on an exhaustive study of thousands of sales reps across multiple industries and geographies, &#8220;The Challenger Sale&#8221; argues that classic relationship building is a losing approach, especially when it comes to selling complex, large-scale business-to-business solutions. The authors&#8217; study found that every sales rep in the world falls into one of five distinct profiles, and while all of these types of reps can deliver average sales performance, only one &#8211; the Challenger &#8211; delivers consistently high performance. Instead of bludgeoning customers with endless facts and features about their company and products, Challengers approach customers with unique insights about how they can save or make money. They tailor their sales message to the customer&#8217;s specific needs and objectives.<br />
                    Rather than acquiescing to the customer&#8217;s every demand or objection, they are assertive, pushing back when necessary and taking control of the sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The subject of &#8220;design thinking&#8221; is the rage at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to the work of IDEO, a leading design firm, and its celebrated CEO, Tim Brown, who uses this book to show how the techniques and strategies of design belong at every level of business.    </p>
<p>                    The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design explains design thinking, the collaborative process by which the designer&#8217;s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people&#8217;s needs, not only with what is technically feasible, but what is viable to the bottom line. Design thinking converts need into demand. It&#8217;s a human-centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.     </p>
<p>                    Introduced a decade ago, the concept of design thinking remains popular at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to work of IDEO, the undisputed world leading strategy, innovation, and design firm headed by Tim Brown. As he makes clear in this visionary guide-now updated with addition material, including new case studies, and a new introduction-design thinking is not just applicable to so-called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It&#8217;s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente, to increase the quality of patient care by re-examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change, or Kraft, to rethink supply chain management.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design is not a book by designers for designers; it is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization, product, or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new edition of an international bestseller helps individuals and organizations shift to a new mindset that will improve performance, spark collaboration, accelerate innovation, and make your life and the lives of everyone around you better.     </p>
<p>                     Without even being aware of it, many of us operate from an inward mindset, a single-minded focus on our own goals and objectives. This book points out the many ways, some quite subtle and deceptive, that this mindset invites tension and conflict. But incredible things happen when people switch to an outward mindset. They intuitively understand what coworkers, colleagues, family, and friends need to be successful and happy. Their organizations thrive, and astonishingly, by focusing on others they become happier and more successful themselves! This new mindset brings about deep and far-reaching changes.     </p>
<p>                     The Outward Mindset presents compelling true stories to illustrate the gaps that individuals and organizations typically experience between their actual inward mindsets and their needed outward mindsets. And it provides simple yet profound guidance and tools to help bridge this mindset gap. This new edition includes a new preface, updated case studies, and new material covering Arbinger&#8217;s latest research on mindsets. In the long run, changing negative behavior without changing one&#8217;s mindset doesn&#8217;t last&#8211;the old behaviors always reassert themselves. But changing the mindset that causes the behavior changes everything.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enchantment, as defined by bestselling business guru Guy Kawasaki, is not about manipulating people. It transforms situations and relationships. It con­verts hostility into civility and civility into affinity. It changes skeptics and cynics into believers and the undecided into the loyal.    </p>
<p>                    Enchantment can happen during a retail transaction, a high-level corporate negotiation, or a Facebook update. And when done right, it&#8217;s more powerful than traditional persuasion, influence, or marketing techniques.    </p>
<p>                    Kawasaki argues that in business and personal interactions, your goal is not merely to get what you want but to bring about a voluntary, enduring, and delightful change in other people. By enlisting their own goals and desires, by being likable and trustworthy, and by framing a cause that others can embrace, you can change hearts, minds, and actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A breakthrough book on the transformative power of collaborative thinking    </p>
<p>                     Collaborative intelligence, or CQ, is a measure of our ability to think with others on behalf of what matters to us all. It is emerging as a new professional currency at a time when the way we think, interact, and innovate is shifting. In the past, &#8220;market share&#8221; companies ruled by hierarchy and topdown leadership. Today, the new market leaders are &#8220;mind share&#8221; companies, where influence is more important than power, and success relies on collaboration and the ability to inspire.    </p>
<p>                    Collaborative Intelligence is the culmination of more than fifty years of original research that draws on Dawna Markova&#8217;s background in cognitive neuroscience and her most recent work, with Angie McArthur, as a &#8220;Professional Thinking Partner&#8221; to some of the world&#8217;s top CEOs and creative professionals. Markova and McArthur are experts at getting brilliant yet difficult people to think together. They have been brought in to troubleshoot for Fortune 500 leaders in crisis and managers struggling to inspire their teams. When asked about their biggest challenges at work, Markova and McArthur&#8217;s clients all cite a common problem: other people. This response reflects the way we have been taught to focus on the gulfs between us rather than valuing our intellectual diversity&#8211;that is, the ways in which each of us is uniquely gifted, how we process information and frame questions, what kind of things deplete us, and what engages and inspires us. Through a series of practices and strategies, the authors teach us how to recognize our own mind patterns and map the talents of our teams, with the goal of embarking together on an aligned course of action and influence. In Markova and McArthur&#8217;s experience, managers who appreciate intellectual diversity will lead their teams to innovation; employees who understand it will thrive because they are in touch with their strengths; and an entire team who understands it will come together to do their best work in a symphony of collaboration, their individual strengths working in harmony like an orchestra or a high-performing sports team. Praise for Collaborative Intelligence    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Rooted in the latest neuroscience on the nature of collaboration, Collaborative Intelligence celebrates the power of working and thinking together at the highest levels of business and politics, and in the smallest aspects of our everyday lives. Dawna Markova and Angie McArthur show us that our ability to collaborate is not only a measure of intelligence, but essential to solving the world&#8217;s problems and seeing the possibilities in ourselves and others.&#8221;&#8211;Arianna Huffington  &#8220;This inspiring book teaches you how to align your intention with the intention of others, and how, through shared strengths and talents, you have every right to expect greatness and set the highest goals and expectations.&#8221;&#8211;Deepak Chopra  &#8220;Everyone talks about collaboration today, but the rhetoric typically outweighs the reality. Collaborative Intelligence offers tangible tools for those serious about becoming &#8216;system leaders&#8217; who can close the gap and make collaboration real.&#8221;&#8211;Peter M. Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I have worked with Markova and McArthur for several years, focusing on achieving better results through intellectual diversity. Their approach has encouraged more candid debate and collaborative behavior within the team. The team, not individuals, becomes the hero.&#8221;&#8211;Al Carey, CEO, PepsiCo</p>

<p>                    We all have bad habits &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a weakness for junk food, a smartphone addiction or a lack of exercise. But change is hard. Forty percent of dieters quit within a week. Eighty percent of New Year&#8217;s resolutions don&#8217;t last beyond January. How can we kick bad habits &#8211; and stick with it?    </p>
<p>                    According to psychologist and behaviour researcher Dr Sean Young, the answer is to stop trying to change the person, and instead change the process. In Stick With It, Dr Young draws on his own research and that of other leading experts to explain how the mind often interferes with breaking bad habits, and how we can outsmart it, increasing the likelihood of lasting change by 200%.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with practical exercises and real-life case studies, Stick With It shows that it is possible to control spending, stick to a diet, exercise regularly and overcome problem behaviours &#8211; forever.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Scientifically grounded and personally implementable. It&#8217;s a winner&#8217; &#8211; Robert Cialdini, author of Influence and Pre-Suasion    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A must-read for anyone who&#8217;s been unable to keep a New Year&#8217;s resolution or failed at making a lasting change in any other area of their life or work. &#8211; Jonah Berger, author of Contagious    </p>
<p>                    Dr Sean Young is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in the field of habit-forming. He is an acclaiedpsychologist and the founder and Executive Director of the UCLA Center for Digital Behavior. His research involves the study of cutting-edge ways of using social media and mobile technologies to change and predict human behaviour.</p>
