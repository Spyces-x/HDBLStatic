										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Shortlisted for the PEN Hessell-Tiltman Prize    </p>
<p>                    Paris, near the turn of 1932-3. Three young friends meet over apricot cocktails at the Bec-de-Gaz bar on the rue Montparnasse. They are Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and their friend Raymond Aron, who opens their eyes to a radical new way of thinking&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s not often that you miss your bus stop because you&#8217;re so engrossed in reading a book about existentialism, but I did exactly that&#8230; The story of Sartre, Beauvoir, Camus, Heidegger et al is strange, fun and compelling reading. If it doesn&#8217;t win awards, I will eat my copy&#8217; Independent on Sunday    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Bakewell shows how fascinating were some of the existentialists&#8217; ideas and how fascinating, often frightful, were their lives. Vivid, humorous anecdotes are interwoven with a lucid and unpatronising exposition of their complex philosophy&#8230; Tender, incisive and fair&#8217; Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Quirky, funny, clear and passionate&#8230; Few writers are as good as Bakewell at explaining complicated ideas in a way that makes them easy to understand&#8217; Mail on Sunday</p>

<p>                    Soon thereafter, the essay was revealed as a brilliant parody, a catalog of nonsense written in the cutting-edge but impenetrable lingo of postmodern theorists. The event sparked a furious debate in academic circles and made the headlines of newspapers in the U.S. and abroad.     </p>
<p>                    In Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals&#8217; Abuse of Science, Sokal and his fellow physicist Jean Bricmont expand from where the hoax left off. In a delightfully witty and clear voice, the two thoughtfully and thoroughly dismantle the pseudo-scientific writings of some of the most fashionable French and American intellectuals. More generally, they challenge the widespread notion that scientific theories are mere narrations or social constructions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of grand sweeping histories such as From Dawn To Decadence, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and A History of God, Hecht champions doubt and questioning as one of the great and noble, if unheralded, intellectual traditions that distinguish the Western mind especially-from Socrates to Galileo and Darwin to Wittgenstein and Hawking. This is an account of the world&#8217;s greatest &#8216;intellectual virtuosos, &#8216; who are also humanity&#8217;s greatest doubters and disbelievers, from the ancient Greek philosophers, Jesus, and the Eastern religions, to modern secular equivalents Marx, Freud and Darwin&#8211;and their attempts to reconcile the seeming meaninglessness of the universe with the human need for meaning,     </p>
<p>                    This remarkable book ranges from the early Greeks, Hebrew figures such as Job and Ecclesiastes, Eastern critical wisdom, Roman stoicism, Jesus as a man of doubt, Gnosticism and Christian mystics, medieval Islamic, Jewish and Christian skeptics, secularism, the rise of science, modern and contemporary critical thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Darwin, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, the existentialists.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Few could explain, let alone seek out, a career in criticism. Yet what A. O. Scott shows in Better Living Through Criticism is that we are, in fact, all critics: because critical thinking informs almost every aspect of artistic creation, of civil action, of interpersonal life. With penetrating insight and humour, Scott shows that while individual critics &#8211; himself included &#8211; can make mistakes and find flaws where they shouldn&#8217;t, criticism as a discipline is one of the noblest, most creative and urgent activities.    </p>
<p>                    Using his own film criticism as a starting point &#8211; everything from an infamous dismissal of the international blockbuster The Avengers to his intense affection for Pixar&#8217;s animated Ratatouille &#8211; Scott expands outwards, easily guiding readers through the complexities of Rilke and Shelley, the origins of Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones, the power of Marina Abramovic and &#8216;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#8217; Scott shows that real criticism was and always will be the breath of fresh air that allows true creativity to thrive. As he puts it: &#8216;The time for criticism is always now, because the imperative to think clearly, never goes away.&#8217;</p>

They have inspired debate, dissent, war and revolution. They have enlightened, outraged, provoked and comforted. They have enriched lives &#8211; and destroyed them. Now Penguin brings you the works of the great thinkers, pioneers, radicals and visionaries whose ideas shook civilization and helped make us who we are. Inspired by the myth of a man condemned to ceaselessly push a rock up a mountain and watch it roll back to the valley below, The Myth of Sisyphus transformed twentieth-century philosophy with its impassioned argument for the value of life in a world without religious meaning.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Standing at the crossroads of psychology and religion, this catalyzing work applied the scientific method to a field abounding in abstract theory. William James believed that individual religious experiences, rather than the precepts of organized religions, were the backbone of the world&#8217;s religious life. His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences &#8211; all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E. Marty discusses how James&#8217;s pluralistic view of religion led to his remarkable tolerance of extreme forms of religious behaviour, his challenging, highly original theories, and his welcome lack of pretension in all of his observations on the individual and the divine.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Honest, funny and dripping with witty aphorisms. Extremely entertaining and enlightening [&#8230;] all the way to journey&#8217;s end&#8217; Herald     </p>
<p>                    One of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy, Religion for Atheists and The School of Life, presents a travel guide with a difference &#8211; an exploration of why we travel, and what we learn along the way&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Few activities seem to promise as much happiness as going travelling: taking off for somewhere else, somewhere far from home, a place with more interesting weather, customs and landscapes. But although we are inundated with advice on where to travel to, we seldom ask why we go and how we might become more fulfilled by doing so.    </p>
<p>                    With the help of a selection of writers, artists and thinkers &#8211; including Flaubert, Edward Hopper, Wordsworth and Van Gogh &#8211; Alain de Botton provides invaluable insights into everything from holiday romance to hotel minibars, airports to sightseeing. The perfect antidote to those guides that tell us what to do when we get there, The Art of Travel tries to explain why we really went in the first place &#8211; and helpfully suggest how we might be happier on our journeys.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Delightful, profound, entertaining. I doubt if de Botton has written a dull sentence in his life&#8217; Jan Morris    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An elegant and subtle work, unlike any other. Beguiling&#8217; Colin Thubron, The Times</p>
