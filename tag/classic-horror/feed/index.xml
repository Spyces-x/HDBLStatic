<p>                    This is the story of a lover&#8217;s triangle . . . It was bad from the start. And it got worse in a hurry.    </p>
<p>                    Christine is eating into his mind, burrowing into his unconscious.    </p>
<p>                    Christine, blood-red, fat, and finned, is twenty. Her promise lies all in her past. Greedy and big, she is Arnie&#8217;s obsession, a &#8217;58 Plymouth Fury. Broken down but not finished.    </p>
<p>                    There is still power in her &#8211; a frightening power that leaks like sump oil, staining and corrupting. A malign power that corrodes the mind and turns ownership into Possession.    </p>

<p>                    Soon to be a television series.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;THE STAND is a masterpiece&#8217; (Guardian). Set in a virus-decimated US, King&#8217;s thrilling American fantasy epic, is a Classic.</p>
<p>                    First come the days of the virus. Then come the dreams.</p>
<p>                    Dark dreams that warn of the coming of the dark man. The apostate of death, his worn-down boot heels tramping the night roads. The warlord of the charnel house and Prince of Evil.</p>
<p>                    His time is at hand. His empire grows in the west and the Apocalypse looms.</p>
<p>                    When a man crashes his car into a petrol station, he brings with him the foul corpses of his wife and daughter. He dies and it doesn&#8217;t take long for the virus which killed him to spread across America and the world.</p>

<p>                    One dark and rainy night, Sir James Monmouth returns to London after years spent travelling alone. </p>
<p>                    Intent on uncovering the secrets of his childhood hero, the mysterious Conrad Vane, he begins to investigate Vane&#8217;s life, but he finds himself warned off at every turn. </p>
<p>                    Before long he realises he is being followed too. A pale, thin boy is haunting his every step but every time he tries to confront the boy he disappears. And what of the chilling scream and desperate sobbing only he can hear? </p>
<p>                    His quest leads him eventually to the old lady of Kittiscar Hall, where he discovers something far more terrible at work than he could ever have imagined.</p>
