										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A clear-eyed explanation of the impact of ice on Earth, its climate, and its residents.      </p>
<p>                     Much has been written about global warming, but the crucial relationship between people and ice has received little focus, until now &#8211; and there is a fierce urgency as the problem accelerates. With clarity and insight, geophysicist and a co-winner of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Henry Pollack, paints a compelling portrait of the delicate geological balance between Earth and its ice, and shows why the current rapid loss of ice portends serious consequences in our not-so-distant future.     </p>
<p>                     Whether sculpting mountains, regulating temperatures, influencing ocean currents, or defining the limits of human settlement, ice has shaped &#8211; and continues to shape &#8211; the world we live in. This important and increasingly relevant book traces the effect of mountain glaciers on supplies of drinking water and agricultural irrigation, as well as the current results of melting permafrost and shrinking Arctic sea ice &#8211; a situation that has degraded the habitat of numerous animals and sparked an international race for seabed oil and minerals. Catastrophic possibilities loom, including rising sea levels and subsequent flooding of low-lying regions worldwide.     </p>
<p>                     A World Without Ice explains why ice matters, and lays out the urgent actions we can take to restore Earth&#8217;s delicate climate balance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With hardly a day without a water-crisis story somewhere, Let There Be Water offers prescriptions on how countries, cities, and businesses can avoid the worst of it. With sixty percent of the country in a desert and despite a rapidly growing population, Israel has been jumping ahead of the water-innovation curve for decades. Beyond securing its own water supply, Israel has also created a high-export industry in water technology, a timely example of how countries can build their economies while making the world better. Built on meticulous research and hundreds of interviews with both world leaders and experts in the field, Let There Be Water tells the inspiring story of how this all came to be. The author is now widely considered to be one of the nation&#8217;s go-to authorities on water and has in the last year alone, spoken to more than 160 different organisations, civic groups, and universities all across the country.</p>
