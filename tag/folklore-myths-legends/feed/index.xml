<p>                    A leaf from an oak tree&#8230;a wildflower&#8230;water from a sparkling stream&#8230;dirt from a cool dark cave&#8211;these are the age-old tools of natural magic. Born of the earth, possessing inherent power, they await only our touch and intention to bring their magical qualities to life.     </p>
<p>                    The four elements are powerful magical tools. Using their energies, we can transform ourselves, our lives, and our world. This much-loved, classic guide offers more than seventy-five spells, rites, and simple rituals you can perform using the marvelous powers of the natural world.     </p>
<p>                    Scott Cunningham was a greatly respected teacher and one of the most influential members of the modern Craft movement. A practitioner of elemental magic for twenty years, he wrote more than fifty books, including the seminal Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The national bestseller, now available in a non-illustrated, standard format paperback edition    </p>
<p>                    The Power of Myth launched an extraordinary resurgence of interest in Joseph Campbell and his work. A preeminent scholar, writer, and teacher, he has had a profound influence on millions of people&#8211;including Star Wars creator George Lucas. To Campbell, mythology was the &#8220;song of the universe, the music of the spheres.&#8221; With Bill Moyers, one of America&#8217;s most prominent journalists, as his thoughtful and engaging interviewer, The Power of Myth touches on subjects from modern marriage to virgin births, from Jesus to John Lennon, offering a brilliant combination of intelligence and wit.     </p>
<p>                    This extraordinary book reveals how the themes and symbols of ancient narratives continue to bring meaning to birth, death, love, and war. From stories of the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece and Rome to traditions of Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity, a broad array of themes are considered that together identify the universality of human experience across time and culture. An impeccable match of interviewer and subject, a timeless distillation of Campbell&#8217;s work, The Power of Myth continues to exert a profound influence on our culture.</p>
