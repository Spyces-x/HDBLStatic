<p>                     With wit and irreverence, lexicographer Kory Stamper cracks open the obsessive world of dictionary writing, from the agonizing decisions about what to define and how to do it to the knotty questions of ever-changing word usage.     </p>
<p>                     Filled with fun facts&#8211;for example, the first documented usage of &#8220;OMG&#8221; was in a letter to Winston Churchill&#8211;and Stamper&#8217;s own stories from the linguistic front lines (including how she became America&#8217;s foremost &#8220;irregardless&#8221; apologist, despite loathing the word), Word by Word is an endlessly entertaining look at the wonderful complexities and eccentricities of the English language.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This &#8216;engaging history of punctuation&#8217; (Wall Street Journal) is not only the first history of its kind, but a complete guide on how to use English punctuation.    </p>
<p>                    Behind every punctuation mark lies a thousand stories. The punctuation of English, marked with occasional rationality, is founded on arbitrariness and littered with oddities. For a system of a few dozen marks it generates a disproportionate degree of  uncertainty and passion, inspiring organisations like the Apostrophe Protection Society and sending enthusiasts, correction-pens in hand, in a crusade against error.    </p>
<p>                    Professor Crystal leads us through this minefield with characteristic wit, clarity and commonsense. He gives a fascinating account of the origin and progress of every kind of punctuation mark over one and a half millennia, and he offers sound advice on how punctuation may be used to meet the needs of every occasion and context.</p>
