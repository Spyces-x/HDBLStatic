<p>                    &#8216;Compelling, haunting, tragic stories  . . . resonate long after you put the book down&#8217; James McConnachie, Sunday Times Book of the Year      </p>
<p>                    The routine traffic stop that ends in tragedy. The spy who spends years undetected at the highest levels of the Pentagon. The false conviction of Amanda Knox. Why do we so often get other people wrong? Why is it so hard to detect a lie, read a face or judge a stranger&#8217;s motives?    </p>
<p>                    Using stories of deceit and fatal errors to cast doubt on our strategies for dealing with the unknown, Malcolm Gladwell takes us on an intellectual adventure into the darker side of human nature, where strangers are never simple and misreading them can have disastrous consequences.    </p>

<p>                    In Practically Radical, William C. Taylor, the New York Times bestselling co-author of Mavericks at Work offers a refreshing, rigorous new look at pragmatic ways to shake things up and make positive change in difficult times.     </p>
<p>                    Exploring how twenty-five for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations&#8211;including IBM, Zappos, Swatch, the Girl Scouts, and Interpol&#8211;made remarkable strides in tough circumstances, Practically Radical raises (and answers) the make-or-break questions facing today&#8217;s leaders in every field: Do you see opportunities the competition doesn&#8217;t see? The most successful organizations embrace one-of-a-kind ideas in a world filled with me-too thinking.Do you have new ideas about where to look for new ideas? Routine practices in one field can be revolutionary when they migrate to another.Are you the most of anything? In business today, the middle of the road is the road to ruin.Are you getting the best contributions from the most people? Change is not a game best played by loners.    </p>
<p>                    Anything but your typical business book, Practically Radical is a must-own for small business owners and CEOs, for managers at all levels, and innovators and entrepreneurs of every stripe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Adaptability is the key human trait. The ability to adapt faster and smarter than the situation is what makes the powerful difference between adapting to cope and adapting to win. Our history is a story of adaptation and change; and in the times of brutal competition and economic uncertainty, it has never been more important to understand how to adapt successfully. Using a series of powerful rules, Max Mckeown explores how to increase the adaptability of you and your organization to create winning positions. Fascinating real-world examples from business, government, military and sport bring the rules of Adaptability to life&#8211;from the world&#8217;s most innovative corporations, to street-level creativity emerging from the slums. Adaptability is a powerful, practical and inspirational guide to success in uncertain times.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Life has questions. They have answers&#8217; New York Times    </p>
<p>                     At last, a book that shows you how to build &#8211; design &#8211; a life you can thrive in, at any age or stage. A well-designed life means a life well-lived. Many of us are still looking for an answer to that perennial question, &#8216;What do I want to be when I grow up?&#8217;    </p>
<p>                     Stanford innovators Bill Burnett and Dave Evans show us how design thinking can help us create a life that is both meaningful and fulfilling, regardless of who and where we are, our careers and our age. Designing Your Life puts forward the idea that the same design thinking responsible for amazing technology, products and spaces can be used to build towards a better life and career by a design of your own making.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;[Designing Your Life] teaches you how to change what&#8217;s not working by turning ideas on their head&#8217; Viv Groskop, author of How To Own The Room    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;An empowering book based on their popular class of the same name at Stanford University&#8230;this book will easily earn a place among career-finding classics&#8217; Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The authors of the international bestseller Business Model Generation explain how to create value propositions customers can&#8217;t resist    </p>
<p>                     Value Proposition Design helps you tackle the core challenge of every business &#8211; creating compelling products and services customers want to buy. This highly practical book, paired with its online companion, will teach you the processes and tools you need to create products that sell.    </p>
<p>                    Using the same stunning visual format as the authors&#8217; global bestseller, Business Model Generation, this sequel explains how to use the &#8220;Value Proposition Canvas&#8221; to design, test, create, and manage products and services customers actually want.    </p>
<p>                    Value Proposition Design is for anyone who has been frustrated by new product meetings based on hunches and intuitions; it&#8217;s for anyone who has watched an expensive new product launch fail in the market. The book will help you understand the patterns of great value propositions, get closer to customers, and avoid wasting time with ideas that won&#8217;t work. You&#8217;ll learn the simple process of designing and testing value propositions, that perfectly match customers&#8217; needs and desires.    </p>
<p>                    In addition the book gives you exclusive access to an online companion on Strategyzer.com. You will be able to assess your work, learn from peers, and download pdfs, checklists, and more.    </p>
<p>                    Value Proposition Design is an essential companion to the &#8220;Business Model Canvas&#8221; from Business Model Generation, a tool embraced globally by startups and large corporations such as MasterCard, 3M, Coca Cola, GE, Fujitsu, LEGO, Colgate-Palmolive, and many more.<br />
                    Value Proposition Design gives you a proven methodology for success, with value propositions that sell, embedded in profitable business models.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenal international bestseller that shows us how to stop trying to predict everything &#8211; and take advantage of uncertainty    </p>
<p>                    What have the invention of the wheel, Pompeii, the Wall Street Crash, Harry Potter and the internet got in common? Why are all forecasters  con-artists? Why should you never run for a train or read a newspaper?     </p>
<p>                    This book is all about Black Swans: the random events that underlie our lives, from bestsellers to world disasters. Their impact is huge; they&#8217;re impossible to predict; yet after they happen we always try to rationalize them.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Taleb is a bouncy and even exhilarating  guide &#8230; I came to relish what he said, and even develop a sneaking affection for him as a person&#8217; Will Self, Independent on Sunday    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What do James Bond and Lipitor have in common? Why do traffic jams appear out of nowhere on highways? What can we learn about innovation from a glass of water? In Loonshots, physicist and entrepreneur Safi Bahcall reveals a surprising new way of thinking about the mysteries of group behaviour and the challenges of nurturing radical breakthroughs.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the science of phase transitions, Bahcall shows why teams, companies, or any group with a mission will suddenly change from embracing wild new ideas to rigidly rejecting them, just as flowing water will suddenly change into brittle ice. Oceans of print have been written about culture. Loonshots identifies the small shifts in structure that control this transition, the same way that temperature controls the change from water to ice.    </p>
<p>                    Using examples that range from the spread of fires in forests to the hunt for terrorists online, and stories of thieves and geniuses and kings, Bahcall shows how this new kind of science helps us understand the fate of companies and empires. Loonshots distills these insights into lessons for creatives, entrepreneurs, and visionaries everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    Over the past decade, researchers have been applying the tools and techniques of phase transitions to understand how birds flock, fish swim, brains work, people vote, criminals behave, ideas spread, diseases erupt, and ecosystems collapse. If twentieth-century science was shaped by the search for fundamental laws, like quantum mechanics and gravity, the twenty-first will be shaped by this new kind of science. Loonshots is the first to apply this science to help all of us unlock our potential to create and nurture the crazy ideas that change the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why anti-lock brakes make us drive faster    </p>
<p>                      Why saving money can lead to financial crises    </p>
<p>                    How football helmets make the game more dangerous    </p>
<p>                    Why letting forest fires burn can be safer than putting them out    </p>
<p>                    We have learned a staggering amount about human nature and disaster-yet we are continually unprepared for car crashes, floods, and financial crises. Partly this is because the very success we&#8217;ve had making life safer enables us to take more extreme, different risks. As our cities, transport systems, and financial markets become more interconnected and complex, so does the potential for disaster.     </p>
<p>                    How do we stay safe? Should we? What if our attempts are exposing us even more to the very risks we are trying to avoid? What if acceptance of danger ultimately makes us more secure and prosperous? Is there such a thing as foolproof?     </p>
<p>                    In this fascinating account of risk-taking and crisis, Greg Ip presents a macro theory of human nature and disaster that explains how we can keep ourselves safe in our increasingly dangerous world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>High-value talent management must be relevant to today&#8217;s workplace Misplaced Talent takes a hard look at the cluttered field of Talent Management, and offers a clear guide to making better people decisions in any organization. Deliberately challenging practitioners to do more, this insightful discussion sorts through the tools and techniques developed over the last century to examine their true relevance to the modern workplace. You&#8217;ll learn which activities show the greatest potential to improve the lives of employees and the organizations they work for, and identify which of your existing practices don&#8217;t really add enough value to be worth the expenditure of time, money, and potentially lost talent. The author asks you to make up your own mind about which approaches work best for your own specific talent decisions, but provides the best theory and practice available today as a foundation upon which to formulate a more relevant strategy. In a world of big data, the potential to understand employees and react appropriately has never been greater. So why is Talent Management as an industry relying on outdated theory and practices?<br />
                    This book is a guide to bringing HR up to date, giving you the tools, techniques, and perspective you need to demonstrate more value to your organization. * Adopt the tools and techniques most effective in today&#8217;s workplace * Identify and discard methods that don&#8217;t add value to the organization * Implement critical changes that can transform the HR function * Make better people decisions based on psychology and research Fundamentally, not much has changed in what constitutes good people practice. Practitioners must demonstrate the value of Talent Management, but the solutions implemented often fall short of the rigor and discipline they deserve. Misplaced Talent provides the insight you need to refocus attention and engage your organization about the value of better people decisions.</p>

Regardless of the task, pressure ruthlessly diminishes our judgment, decision-making, attention, dexterity, and performance in every professional and personal arena.

But there are things we can do to diminish its effects on our performance.     </p>
<p>                     Performing Under Pressure draws on research from over 12,000 people, and features the latest research from neuroscience and from the frontline experiences of Fortune 500 employees and managers, Navy SEALS, Olympic and other elite athletes, and others.

Successful CEOs, fire fighters, and military officers all know how to manage delay to gather as much information as possible to get the results they need.    </p>
<p>                    In Wait, Frank Partnoy argues that decisions of all kinds, whether &#8216;snap&#8217; or long-term, benefit from being made at the last possible moment. The art of knowing how long you can afford to delay before committing is at the heart of many a great decision, whether in a corporate takeover or a marriage proposal. Apologies are better received if they are not rushed and people who can defer gratification are happier and more successful than those who must have everything now. Partnoy demonstrates that the ability to wait is crucial to getting the right answer and that gut instincts are often wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ken Robinson argues that organisations everywhere are trying to fix a problem that originates in schools and universities: &#8220;It is often said that education and training are the keys to the future. They are, but a key can be turned in two directions. Turn it one way and you lock resources away, even from those they belong to. Turn it the other way and you release resources and give people back to themselves. To realize our true creative potential-in our organizations, in our schools and in our communities we need to think differently about ourselves and to act differently towards each other. We must learn to be creative.&#8221; Ken Robinson The updated 3rd edition features a new introduction, modernized case studies, updated demographics and revised sections around technological developments and recent changes to the education system.</p>

<p>                              Shortlisted for the 2012 Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award and the Wellcome Trust Book Prize, this startling and unconventional book from neuroscientist and former Wall Street trader John Coates shows us the bankers in their natural environment, revealing how their biochemistry has a lasting and significant impact on our economy.    </p>
<p>                              We learn how risk stimulates the most primitive part of the banker&#8217;s brain and how making the deals our bank balances depend on provokes an overwhelming fight-or-flight response. Constant swinging between aggression and apprehension impairs their judgment, causing economic upheaval in the wider world. The transformation between each split-second decision is what Coates calls the hour between dog and wolf, and understanding the biology behind bubbles and crashes may be the key to stabilising the markets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SHORTLISTED FOR THE BUSINESS BOOK AWARDS 2021    </p>
<p>                    In The 4 Day Week, entrepreneur and business innovator Andrew Barnes makes the case for the four-day work week as the answer to many of the ills of the 21st-century global economy.     </p>
<p>                     Barnes conducted an experiment in his own business, the New Zealand trust company Perpetual Guardian, and asked his staff to design a four-day week that would permit them to meet their existing productivity requirements on the same salary but with a 20% cut in work hours. The outcomes of this trial, which no business leader had previously attempted on these terms, were stunning. People were happier and healthier, more engaged in their personal lives, and more focused and productive in the office.    </p>
<p>                     The world of work has seen a dramatic shift in recent times: the former security and benefits associated with permanent employment are being displaced by the less stable gig economy. Barnes explains the dangers of a focus on flexibility at the expense of hard-won worker protections, and argues that with the four-day week, we can have the best of all worlds: optimal productivity, work-life balance, worker benefits and, at long last, a solution to pervasive economic inequities such as the gender pay gap and lack of diversity in business and governance.     </p>
<p>                     The 4 Day Week is a practical, how-to guide for business leaders and employees alike that is applicable to nearly every industry. Using qualitative and quantitative data from research gathered through the Perpetual Guardian trial and other sources by the University of Auckland and Auckland University of Technology, the book presents a step-by-step approach to preparing businesses for productivity-focused flexibility, from the necessary cultural conditions to the often complex legislative considerations.    </p>
<p>                     The story of Perpetual Guardian&#8217;s unprecedented work experiment has made headlines around the world and stormed social media, reaching a global audience in more than seventy countries. A mix of trenchant analysis, personal observation and actionable advice, The 4 Day Week is an essential guide for leaders and workers seeking to make a change for the better in their work world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Plenty of books offer useful advice on how to get better at making quick-thinking, intuitive choices. But what about more consequential decisions, the ones that affect our lives for years, or centuries, to come? Our most powerful stories revolve around these kinds of decisions: where to live, whom to marry, what to believe, whether to start a company, how to end a war.    </p>
<p>                    Full of the beautifully crafted storytelling and novel insights that Steven Johnson&#8217;s fans know to expect, Farsighted draws lessons from cognitive science, social psychology, military strategy, environmental planning, and great works of literature. Everyone thinks we are living in an age of short attention spans, but we&#8217;ve actually learned a lot about making long-term decisions over the past few decades. Johnson makes a compelling case for a smarter and more deliberative decision-making approach. He argues that we choose better when we break out of the myopia of single-scale thinking and develop methods for considering all the factors involved.    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all model for the important decisions that can alter the course of a life, an organization, or a civilization. But Farsighted explains how we can approach these choices more effectively, and how we can appreciate the subtle intelligence of choices that shaped our broader social history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing upon a six-year research project at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business, James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras took eighteen truly exceptional and long-lasting companies and studied each in direct comparison to one of its top competitors. They examined the companies from their very beginnings to the present day &#8212; as start-ups, as midsize companies, and as large corporations. Throughout, the authors asked: What makes the truly exceptional companies different from the comparison companies and what were the common practices these enduringly great companies followed throughout their history?     </p>
<p>                    Filled with hundreds of specific examples and organized into a coherent framework of practical concepts that can be applied by managers and entrepreneurs at all levels, Built to Last provides a master blueprint for building organizations that will prosper long into the 21st century and beyond.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us assume that our creative process is beyond our ability to influence, and pay attention to it only when it isn&#8217;t working properly. For the most part, we go about our daily tasks and everything just works. Until it doesn&#8217;t. Adding to this lack of understanding is the rapidly accelerating pace of work. Each day we are face escalating expectations and a continual squeeze to do more with less. We are asked to produce an ever-increasing amount of brilliance in an ever-shrinking amount of time. There is an unspoken (or spoken!) expectation that we&#8217;ll be accessible 24/7, and as a result we frequently feel like we&#8217;re always on. Now business creativity expert Todd Henry explains how to unleash your creative potential. Whether you&#8217;re a creative by trade or an accidental creative, this book will help you quickly and effectively integrate new ideas into your daily life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lessons for a new generation of leaders on teamwork, meetings, conversations, free food, social media, apologizing, and other topics.    </p>
<p>                    When designer and computer scientist John Maeda was tapped to be president of the celebrated Rhode Island School of Design in 2008, he had to learn how to be a leader quickly. He had to transform himself from a tenured professor&#8211;with a love of argument for argument&#8217;s sake and the freedom to experiment&#8211;into the head of a hierarchical organization. The professor is free to speak his mind against &#8220;the man.&#8221; The college president is &#8220;the man.&#8221; Maeda has had to teach himself, through trial and error, about leadership. In Redesigning Leadership, he shares his learning process.     </p>
<p>                    Maeda, writing as an artist and designer, a technologist, and a professor, discusses intuition and risk-taking, &#8220;transparency,&#8221; and all the things that a conversation can do that an email can&#8217;t. In his transition from MIT to RISD he finds that the most effective way to pull people together is not social networking but free food. Leading a team? The best way for a leader to leverage the collective power of a team is to reveal his or her own humanity.     </p>
<p>                    Asked if he has stopped designing, Maeda replied (via Twitter) &#8220;I&#8217;m designing how to talk about/with/for our #RISD community.&#8221; Maeda&#8217;s creative nature makes him a different sort of leader&#8211;one who prizes experimentation, honest critique, and learning as you go. With Redesigning Leadership, he uses his experience to reveal a new model of leadership for the next generation of leaders.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This iconic bestseller from the bestselling author of All Marketers Are Liars proves that winners are just the best quitters and &#8216;should be on every entrepreneur&#8217;s book list&#8217; (Entrepreneur.com)    </p>
<p>                    Every new project (or career or relationship) starts out exciting and fun. Then it gets harder and less fun, until it hits a low point &#8211; really hard, really not fun. At this point you might be in a Dip, which will get better if you keep pushing, or a Cul-de-Sac, which will never get better no matter how hard you try. The hard part is knowing the difference and acting on it.     </p>
<p>                    According to marketing guru and best-selling author Seth Godin, what sets successful entrepreneurs (and pop stars and weight lifters and car salesmen) apart from everyone else is their ability to give up on Cul-de-Sacs while staying motivated in Dips. Winners quit fast, quit often and quit without guilt &#8211; until they commit to beating the right Dip for the right reasons. You&#8217;ll never be number one at anything without picking your shots very carefully. The Dip is a short, entertaining book that helps you do just that. It will forever alter the way you think about success.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Smart, honest, and refreshingly free of self-help posturing, this primer on winning-through-quitting is at once motivational and comically indifferent. . . Godin&#8217;s truth-that &#8220;we fail when we get distracted by tasks we don&#8217;t have the guts to quit&#8221;-makes excellent sense of an often-difficult career move&#8217; (Publishers Weekly)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An invaluable resource for making sense of the world, making good decisions, and placing smart bets. A fast-paced and fun read jam-packed with useful information on every page.&#8217; Annie Duke, author of Thinking in Bets<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Turn yourself into a superthinker and make the right decisions every time.    </p>
<p>                     You want to make better decisions. You want to be right more of the time professionally and personally. However, being more right consistently is a hard problem because the world is such a complex, evolving place. How do you navigate this complexity?    </p>
<p>                     Mental models are decision-making tools that guide our perception of the world and our behaviour in it. They help us understand life, make decisions and solve problems. The best models help us make intelligent investments, develop ground-breaking technologies and even travel to outer space.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Note your frame of reference before debating someone with different political views. If you understand how your perspective contrasts with someone else&#8217;s you can prevent the conversation from getting hostile.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Apply the sunk cost fallacy to the end of a doomed project. Just because you&#8217;ve put a lot of hours into it doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to keep going.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Before blaming someone, consider Hanlon&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by carelessness&#8217;.    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Try to solve mysteries with Occam&#8217;s Razor, &#8216;Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected&#8217;. When you hear hoof beats, think of horses not zebras.    </p>
<p>                     Building on our knowledge of well-known models such as the Bandwagon Effect or Paradigm Shift and introducing us to the lesser known like the Eisenhower Matrix or the Boiling Frog Symbol, this indispensable book distils the most effective mental models into a single, digestible volume. It will make even the most complex models accessible and engaging to enable you to make better, more informed decisions in every part of your life.<br />
                     ________________    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;Internalizing these mental models will help you understand the world around you. Once you can spot them, you can change your own behavior to avoid common traps, adjust how you interact with people to get better results, and maybe even articulate new mental models of the world that have yet to be discovered.&#8217; Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO, Coinbase    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;You can&#8217;t really know anything if you just remember isolated facts. If the facts don&#8217;t hang together on a latticework of theory, you don&#8217;t have them in a usable form. You&#8217;ve got to have models in your head.&#8217; Charlie Munger, vice chairman, Berkshire Hathaway</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tim Ferriss, the #1 New York Times best-selling author of The 4-Hour Workweek, shares the ultimate choose-your-own-adventure book-a compilation of tools, tactics, and habits from 130+ of the world&#8217;s top performers. From iconic entrepreneurs to elite athletes, from artists to billionaire investors, their short profiles can help you answer life&#8217;s most challenging questions, achieve extraordinary results, and transform your life.    </p>
<p>                    From the author:    </p>
<p>                    In 2017, several of my close friends died in rapid succession. It was a very hard year, as it was for many people.    </p>
<p>                    It was also a stark reminder that time is our scarcest, non-renewable resource.    </p>
<p>                    With a renewed sense of urgency, I began asking myself many questions:    </p>
<p>                    Were my goals my own, or simply what I thought I should want?<br />
                    How much of life had I missed from underplanning or overplanning?<br />
                    How could I be kinder to myself?<br />
                    How could I better say &#8220;no&#8221; to the trivial many to better say &#8220;yes&#8221; to the critical few?<br />
                    How could I best reassess my priorities and my purpose in this world?    </p>
<p>                    To find answers, I reached out to the most impressive world-class performers in the world, ranging from wunderkinds in their 20s to icons in their 70s and 80s. No stone was left unturned.    </p>
<p>                    This book contains their answers-practical and tactical advice from mentors who have found solutions. Whether you want to 10x your results, get unstuck, or reinvent yourself, someone else has traveled a similar path and taken notes.    </p>
<p>                    This book, Tribe of Mentors, includes many of the people I grew up viewing as idols or demi-gods. Less than 10% have been on my podcast (The Tim Ferriss Show, more than 200 million downloads), making this a brand-new playbook of playbooks.    </p>
<p>                    No matter your challenge or opportunity, something in these pages can help.    </p>
<p>                    Among other things, you will learn:    </p>
<p>                    More than 50 morning routines-both for the early riser and those who struggle to get out of bed.<br />
                    How TED curator Chris Anderson realized that the best way to get things done is to let go.<br />
                    The best purchases of $100 or less (you&#8217;ll never have to think about the right gift again).<br />
                    How to overcome failure and bounce back towards success.<br />
                    Why Humans of New York creator Brandon Stanton believes that the best art will always be the riskiest.<br />
                    How to meditate and be more mindful (and not just for those that find it easy).<br />
                    Why tennis champion Maria Sharapova believe that &#8220;losing makes you think in ways victories can&#8217;t.&#8221;<br />
                    How to truly achieve work-life balance (and why most people tell you it isn&#8217;t realistic).<br />
                    How billionaire Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz transformed the way he engages with difficult situations to reduce suffering.<br />
                    Ways to thrive (and survive) the overwhelming amount of information you process every day.<br />
                    How to achieve clarity on your purpose and assess your priorities.<br />
                    And much more.    </p>
<p>                    This reference book, which I wrote for myself, has already changed my life. I certainly hope the same for you.    </p>
<p>                    I wish you luck as you forge your own path.    </p>
<p>                    All the best,    </p>
<p>                    Tim Ferriss</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s visionary vice chairman and Warren Buffett&#8217;s indispensable financial partner, has outperformed market indexes again and again, and he believes any investor can do the same. His notion of &#8220;elementary, worldly wisdom&#8221;-a set of interdisciplinary mental models involving economics, business, psychology, ethics, and management-allows him to keep his emotions out of his investments and avoid the common pitfalls of bad judgment.  Munger&#8217;s system has steered his investments for forty years and has guided generations of successful investors. This book presents the essential steps of Munger&#8217;s investing strategy, condensed here for the first time from interviews, speeches, writings, and shareholder letters, and paired with commentary from fund managers, value investors, and business-case historians. Derived from Ben Graham&#8217;s value-investing system, Munger&#8217;s approach is straightforward enough that ordinary investors can apply it to their portfolios. This book is not simply about investing. It is about cultivating mental models for your whole life, but especially for your investments.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tear down the obstacles to creative innovation in your organization    </p>
<p>                     Unlocking Creativity is an exploration of the creative process and how organizations can clear the way for innovation. In many organizations, creative individuals face stubborn resistance to new ideas. Managers and executives oftentimes reject innovation and unconventional approaches due to misplaced allegiance to the status quo. Questioning established practices or challenging prevailing sentiments is frequently met with stiff resistance. In this climate of stifled creativity and inflexible adherence to conventional wisdom, potentially game-changing ideas are dismissed outright. Senior leaders claim to value creativity, yet often lack the knowledge to provide a creative framework. Unlocking Creativity offers effective methods and real-world examples of how the most successful organizations create cultures of innovation and experimentation.    </p>
<p>                     Best-selling author and scholar Michael Roberto presents a thorough investigation of organizational obstacles to creative thought. Highly relevant to the growth crises many enterprises face in today&#8217;s economic landscape, this book examines how to break barriers to spark creativity and foster new ideas. This insightful and informative work allows business executives, senior managers, and organization leaders to:    </p>
<p>                    Recognize the six organizational mindsets that impede creativity and innovation<br />
                    Learn how to tear down the barriers that obstruct the creative process<br />
                    Create an environment that allows talented people to thrive<br />
                    Encourage creative collaboration in teams throughout an organization    </p>
<p>                     Leaders do not have to conceive innovative ideas, but rather open the path for curious and creative employees within their organization. Unlocking Creativity: How to Solve Any Problem and Make the Best Decisions aids organizations in removing obstacles to the creative process and helps to form an atmosphere of imagination and innovation.</p>

<p>                    Six Thinking Hats, Edward de Bono&#8217;s classic book on meetings, remains as relevant as ever. Used to huge success by big companies and organisations such as IBM, Siemens and NASA, the Six-Hats method is a proven way to:    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Financial Times Book of the Month pick for April! Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career-record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn&#8217;t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions&#8211;or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven&#8217;t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out&#8211;the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don&#8217;t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel,  Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world&#8217;s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don&#8217;t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager&#8217;s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wall Street Journal bestseller!     </p>
<p>                    Poker champion turned business consultant Annie Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty and make better decisions as a result.     </p>
<p>                    In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots&#8217; one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?     </p>
<p>                    Even the best decision doesn&#8217;t yield the best outcome every time. There&#8217;s always an element of luck that you can&#8217;t control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making?     </p>
<p>                    Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it&#8217;s difficult to say I&#8217;m not sure in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don&#8217;t always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don&#8217;t always lead to bad outcomes.     </p>
<p>                    By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You&#8217;ll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run.</p>

<p>                    The way we work is broken. It takes forever to get anything done. Meetings and emails are incessant. Bureaucracy stifles talent and creativity.  Is this really the best we can do?    </p>

<p>                    *         Have fewer but better meetings<br />

<p>                     In this extraordinary book, Ram Nidumolu uses evocative parables and stories from the ancient Indian wisdom texts, the Upanishads, to introduce Being-centered leadership. This new kind of leadership is anchored in the concept of Being, the fundamental reality that underlies all phenomena. Being-centered leaders are guided by an innate sense of interconnection&#8211;the good of the whole becomes an integral part of their decisions and actions. Using the experiences of over twenty trailblazing CEOs, as well as those from his own life, Nidumolu describes a four-stage road map every aspiring leader can use to reconnect business to the wider world&#8211;to the benefit of all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this culmination of five decades of acclaimed studies in presidential history, Doris Kearns Goodwin offers an illuminating exploration of the origin, uncertain growth, and finally, the exercise of fully developed leadership.    </p>
<p>                    Are leaders born or made? Where does ambition come from? How does adversity affect the growth of leadership? Does the man make the times or does the times make the man?    </p>
<p>                    In Leadership Goodwin draws upon four of the presidents she has studied &#8211; Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson &#8211; to show how they first recognized leadership qualities within themselves, and were recognized as leaders by others. By looking back to their first entry into public life, when their paths were filled with confusion, hope, and fear, we can share their struggles and follow their development into leaders.    </p>
<p>                    Leadership tells the story of how they all collided with dramatic reversals that disrupted their lives and threatened to forever shatter their ambitions. Nonetheless, they all emerged fitted to confront the contours and dilemmas of their times.     </p>
<p>                    No common pattern describes the trajectory of leadership. Although set apart in background, abilities and temperament, they shared a fierce ambition, a hunger to succeed beyond expectations. All four, at their best, were guided by a sense of moral purpose that led them at moments of great challenge to summon their talents to enlarge the opportunities and lives of others.    </p>
<p>                    This seminal work provides a roadmap for aspiring and established leaders. In today&#8217;s polarized world, these stories of authentic leadership in time of surpassing fracture and fear take on a singular urgency.    </p>

                    ___________________________________________________<br />
                     Overwhelmed by demands on your time? Baffled by the sheer volume of data?<br />
                    You&#8217;re not alone. Even the smartest mind can&#8217;t beat the organized mind &#8211; when we&#8217;re unable to make sense of it all, our creativity plummets, our decision making suffers and we grow absent-minded. Nowadays, we drown under emails, forever juggle six tasks at once and try to make complex decisions ever more quickly. This is information overload.    </p>
<p>                     Using a combination of academic research and examples from daily life, Daniel Levitin explains how to take back control of your life, from healthcare to online dating to raising kids, showing that the secret to success is always organization. You&#8217;ll discover life-changing facts about:    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; How to make the most of your brain&#8217;s daily processing limit<br />
                     &#8211; Why pressing Send or clicking Like are addictive<br />
                     &#8211; Why daydreaming is your brain at its most productive<br />
                     &#8211; What the most successful people keep in their drawer<br />
                     &#8211; Why multitasking is a bad way to do nearly everything    </p>
<p>                     In a world where information is power, The Organized Mind holds the key to harnessing that information and making it work for you.</p>

<p>                    What is the best way for a company to innovate? Advice recommending &#8220;innovation vacations&#8221; and the luxury of failure may be wonderful for organizations with time to spend and money to waste. The Innovator&#8217;s Hypothesis addresses the innovation priorities of companies that live in the real world of limits. Michael Schrage advocates a cultural and strategic shift: small teams, collaboratively&#8211;and competitively&#8211;crafting business experiments that make top management sit up and take notice. He introduces the 5&#215;5 framework: giving diverse teams of five people up to five days to come up with portfolios of five business experiments costing no more than $5,000 each and taking no longer than five weeks to run. Successful 5x5s, Schrage shows, make people more effective innovators, and more effective innovators mean more effective innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When It&#8217;s Smart to Say No     </p>
<p>                     Nearly every week we read about a tragedy or scandal that could have been prevented if individuals had said no to ill-advised or illegitimate orders. In this timely book, Ira Chaleff explores when and how to disobey inappropriate orders, reduce unacceptable risk, and find better ways to achieve legitimate goals.     </p>
<p>                     The inspiration for the book, and its title, comes from the concept of intelligent disobedience used in guide dog training. Guide dogs must recognize and resist a command that would put their human and themselves at risk and identify safer options for achieving the goal. This is precisely what Chaleff helps humans do. Using both deeply disturbing and uplifting examples, as well as critical but largely forgotten research, he shows how to create a culture where, rather than &#8220;just following orders,&#8221; people hold themselves accountable to do the right thing, always.</p>

An instant classic, this revised and updated edition of the phenomenal bestseller dispels the myths about starting your own business. Small business consultant and author Michael E. Gerber, with sharp insight gained from years of experience, points out how common assumptions, expectations, and even technical expertise can get in the way of running a successful business.  Gerber walks you through the steps in the life of a business-from entrepreneurial infancy through adolescent growing pains to the mature entrepreneurial perspective: the guiding light of all businesses that succeed-and shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business, whether or not it is a franchise. Most importantly, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business.<br />
                    The E-Myth Revisited will help you grow your business in a productive, assured way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Marquet is the kind of leader who comes around only once in a generation &#8230; his ideas and lessons are invaluable&#8217; Simon Sinek, author of Start With Why    </p>
<p>                    Captain David Marquet was used to giving orders. In the high-stress environment of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, it was crucial his men did their job well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor performance and the worst retention in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    One day, Marquet unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway. He realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things.     </p>
<p>                    Marquet took matters into his own hands and pushed for leadership at every level. Before long, his crew became fully engaged and the Santa Fe skyrocketed from worst to first in the fleet.     </p>
<p>                    No matter your business or position, you can apply Marquet&#8217;s approach to create a workplace where everyone takes responsibility for their actions, people are healthier and happier &#8211; and everyone is a leader.    </p>
<p>                    In his latest book, Leadership is Language, Marquet builds on what he teaches in Turn the Ship Around!, showing us how to lead our teams to success through the language that we use.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Move past the obstacles and implement your new strategy Move is your guide to mobilizing your whole organization to take your business forward. Whatever your needed transformation may be: a new initiative, a new market, a new product, your fresh strategy is up against a powerful foe: an organization&#8217;s tendency to stay very busy and completely engaged what it&#8217;s already doing. This book shows you how to cut through resistance and get your team engaged and proactively doing the new thing! Author Patty Azzarello draws on over twenty-five years of international business management experience to identify the chronic challenges that keep organizations from decisively executing strategy, and to give you a practical game plan for breaking through. Leaders tend to assume that stalls in execution are inevitable, unchanging parts of the workplace but things can change. At the heart of every execution problem is the fact that there simply are not enough people doing what the business needs. This guide shows you how to get your entire organization on board remove the fear, excuses, and hurdles and uphold the new pursuit against distractions and dissent.<br />
                    No transformation can succeed without suitable engagement from the whole organization, but building engagement can be difficult, uncomfortable, and tentative. This book shows you how to get it done. * Get your organization to embrace and personally commit to the new work * Remove obstacles and passive aggressive attacks that block progress * Defend new strategic initiatives against short term pressures to revert to &#8220;business as usual&#8221; * Sustain momentum and the desire to move forward * Make sure no one is ever asking, &#8216;Are we still doing this?&#8217; Inertia isn&#8217;t just a law of the universe, it&#8217;s a law in the workplace that can be a major obstacle to making things happen. The great thing about inertia is that it cuts two ways: a body at rest remains at rest, but a body in motion remains in motion. People love to finish things. Move shows you how to make successful execution the new norm starting today.</p>

Kasturi Rangan These essential questions, grounded in Peter Drucker&#8217;s theories of management, will take readers on a exploration of organizational and personal self-discovery, giving them a means to assess how to  be &#8211;how to develop quality, character, mind-set, values and courage. The questions lead to action. By asking these questions, readers can focus on why they are doing what they are doing in their work, and how to do it better.<br />
                    Designed for today&#8217;s busy professionals, this brief, clear and accessible book will challenge readers to ask these provocative questions and it will stimulate spirited discussions and action within any organization, inspiring positive change and new levels of excellence, helping all to envision the future of theirs&#8217; or any organization.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times bestselling author and Oscar-winning producer Brian Grazer has written a brilliantly entertaining and eye-opening exploration of curiosity and the life-changing effects it can have on every person&#8217;s life.<br />
                         From Academy Award-winning producer Brian Grazer, New York Times bestseller A Curious Mind offers a brilliant peek into the &#8220;curiosity conversations&#8221; that inspired him to create some of the world&#8217;s most iconic movies and television shows. He shows how curiosity has been the &#8220;secret&#8221; that fueled his rise as one of Hollywood&#8217;s leading producers and creative visionaries, and how all of us can channel its power to lead bigger and more rewarding lives.<br />
                         Grazer has spent most of his life exploring curiosity through what he terms &#8220;curiosity conversations&#8221; with some of the most interesting people in the world, including spies, royals, scientists, politicians, moguls, Nobel laureates, artists&#8230;anyone whose story might broaden his worldview. These discussions sparked the creative inspiration behind many of his movies and TV shows, including Splash, 24, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, Arrested Development, 8 Mile, J. Edgar, Empire, and many others.<br />
                        A Curious Mind is not only a fascinating page-turner-it also offers a blueprint for how we can awaken our own curiosity and use it as a superpower in our lives. Whether you&#8217;re looking to strengthen your management style at work, uncover a new source of creativity, or become a better romantic partner, this book-and its lessons on the power of curiosity-can change your life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WHAT ARE THE ODDS YOU&#8217;LL WIN THE LOTTERY?<br />
                    How long will your kids wait in line at Disney World?Who decides that &#8220;standardized tests&#8221; are fair?Why do highway engineers build slow-moving ramps?What does it mean, statistically, to be an &#8220;Average Joe&#8221;?NUMBERS RULE YOUR WORLD<br />
                    In the popular tradition of eye-opening bestsellers like Freakonomics, The Tipping Point, and Super Crunchers, this fascinating book from renowned statistician and blogger Kaiser Fung takes you inside the hidden world of facts and figures that affect you every day, in every way. These are the statistics that rule your life, your job, your commute, your vacation, your food, your health, your money, and your success. This is how engineers calculate your quality of living, how corporations determine your needs, and how politicians estimate your opinions. These are the numbers you never think about-even though they play a crucial role in every single aspect of your life.What you learn may surprise you, amuse you, or even enrage you. But there&#8217;s one thing you won&#8217;t be able to deny: Numbers Rule Your World&#8230;&#8221;An easy read with a big benefit.&#8221;<br />
                    -Fareed Zakaria, CNN    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;For those who have anxiety about how organization data-mining is impacting their world,  Kaiser Fung pulls back the curtain to reveal the good and the bad of predictive analytics.&#8221;<br />
                    -Ian Ayres,Yale professor and author of Super Crunchers:  Why Thinking By Numbers is the New Way to Be Smart<br />
                     &#8220;A book that engages us with stories that a journalist would write, the compelling stories behind the stories as illuminated by the numbers, and the dynamics that the numbers reveal.&#8221;<br />
                    -John Sall, Executive Vice President, SAS Institute  &#8220;Little did I suspect, when I picked up Kaiser Fung&#8217;s book, that I would become so entranced by it &#8211; an illuminating and accessible exploration of the power of statistical analysis for those of us who have no prior training in a field that he explores so ably.&#8221;<br />
                    -Peter Clarke, author of  Keynes: The Rise, Fall, and Return of the 20th Century&#8217;s Most Influential Economist    </p>
<p>                     &#8220;A tremendous book. . . . If you want to understand how to use statistics, how to think with numbers and yet to do this without getting lost in equations, if you&#8217;ve been looking for the book to unlock the door to logical thinking about problems, well, you will be pleased to know that you are holding that book in your hands.&#8221;<br />
                    -Daniel Finkelstein, Executive Editor, The Times of London&#8221;I thoroughly enjoyed this accessible book and enthusiastically recommendit to anyone looking to understand and appreciate the role of statistics and dataanalysis in solving problems and in creating a better world.&#8221;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Jim Paul&#8217;s meteoric rise took him from a small town in Northern Kentucky to governor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, yet he lost it all-his fortune, his reputation, and his job-in one fatal attack of excessive economic hubris. In this honest, frank analysis, Paul and Brendan Moynihan revisit the events that led to Paul&#8217;s disastrous decision and examine the psychological factors behind bad financial practices in several economic sectors.  This book-winner of a 2014 Axiom Business Book award gold medal-begins with the unbroken string of successes that helped Paul achieve a jet-setting lifestyle and land a key spot with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. It then describes the circumstances leading up to Paul&#8217;s $1.6 million loss and the essential lessons he learned from it-primarily that, although there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are people participating in them, all losses come from the same few sources. Investors lose money in the markets either because of errors in their analysis or because of psychological barriers preventing the application of analysis.<br />
                    While all analytical methods have some validity and make allowances for instances in which they do not work, psychological factors can keep an investor in a losing position, causing him to abandon one method for another in order to rationalize the decisions already made. Paul and Moynihan&#8217;s cautionary tale includes strategies for avoiding loss tied to a simple framework for understanding, accepting, and dodging the dangers of investing, trading, and speculating.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The subject of &#8220;design thinking&#8221; is the rage at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to the work of IDEO, a leading design firm, and its celebrated CEO, Tim Brown, who uses this book to show how the techniques and strategies of design belong at every level of business.    </p>
<p>                    The myth of innovation is that brilliant ideas leap fully formed from the minds of geniuses. The reality is that most innovations come from a process of rigorous examination through which great ideas are identified and developed before being realized as new offerings and capabilities.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design explains design thinking, the collaborative process by which the designer&#8217;s sensibilities and methods are employed to match people&#8217;s needs, not only with what is technically feasible, but what is viable to the bottom line. Design thinking converts need into demand. It&#8217;s a human-centered approach to problem solving that helps people and organizations become more innovative and more creative.     </p>
<p>                    Introduced a decade ago, the concept of design thinking remains popular at business schools, throughout corporations, and increasingly in the popular press-due in large part to work of IDEO, the undisputed world leading strategy, innovation, and design firm headed by Tim Brown. As he makes clear in this visionary guide-now updated with addition material, including new case studies, and a new introduction-design thinking is not just applicable to so-called creative industries or people who work in the design field. It&#8217;s a methodology that has been used by organizations such as Kaiser Permanente, to increase the quality of patient care by re-examining the ways that their nurses manage shift change, or Kraft, to rethink supply chain management.     </p>
<p>                    Change by Design is not a book by designers for designers; it is a book for creative leaders seeking to infuse design thinking into every level of an organization, product, or service to drive new alternatives for business and society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Conquering the dating market&#8211;from an economist&#8217;s point of view  After more than twenty years, economist Paul Oyer found himself back on the dating scene&#8211;but what a difference a few years made. Dating was now dominated by sites like Match.com, eHarmony, and OkCupid. But Oyer had a secret weapon: economics.  It turns out that dating sites are no different than the markets Oyer had spent a lifetime studying. Monster.com, eBay, and other sites where individuals come together to find a match gave Oyer startling insight into the modern dating scene. The arcane language of economics&#8211;search, signaling, adverse selection, cheap talk, statistical discrimination, thick markets, and network externalities&#8211;provides a useful guide to finding a mate. Using the ideas that are central to how markets and economics and dating work, Oyer shows how you can apply these ideas to take advantage of the economics in everyday life, all around you, all the time.  For all online daters&#8211;and for anyone else swimming in the vast sea of the information economy&#8211;this book uses Oyer&#8217;s own experiences, and those of millions of others, to help you navigate the key economic concepts that drive the modern age.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times Bestseller named one of the &#8220;Most Important Books of 2016&#8221; by Inc, and a Forbes 2016 &#8220;Must Read Business Book&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you love &#8216;Bones&#8217; and &#8216;CSI&#8217;, this book is your kind of candy&#8217; Paco Underhill, author of Why We Buy    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Martin&#8217;s best book to date. A personal, intuitive, powerful way to look at making an impact with your work&#8217; Seth Godin, author of Purple Cow    </p>
<p>                    Martin Lindstrom, one of Time Magazine&#8217;s 100 Most Influential People in The World and a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, harnesses the power of &#8220;small data&#8221; in his quest to discover the next big thing.    </p>
<p>                    In an era where many believe Big Data has rendered human perception and observation &#8216;old-school&#8217; or passe, Martin Lindstrom shows that mining and matching technological data with up-close psychological insight creates the ultimate snapshot of who we really are and what we really want. He works like a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, accumulating small clues &#8211; the progressively weaker handshakes of Millenials, a notable global decrease in the use of facial powder, a change in how younger consumers approach eating ice cream cones &#8211; to help solve a stunningly diverse array of challenges. In Switzerland, a stuffed teddy bear in a teenage girl&#8217;s bedroom helped revolutionise 1,000 stores &#8211; spread across twenty countries &#8211; for one of Europe&#8217;s largest fashion retailers. In Dubai, a distinctive bracelet strung with pearls helped Jenny Craig offset its declining membership in the United States and increase loyalty by 159% in only one year. In China, the look of a car dashboard led to the design of the iRobot, or Roomba, floor cleaner &#8211; a great success story.    </p>
<p>                    SMALL DATA combines armchair travel with forensic psychology in an interlocking series of international clue-gathering detective stories. It shows Lindstrom using his proprietary CLUES Framework &#8211; where big data is merely one part of the overall puzzle &#8211; to get radically close to consumers and come up with the counter-intuitive insights that have in some cases helped transform entire industries.     </p>
<p>                    SMALL DATA presents a rare behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to create global brands, and reveals surprising and counter-intuitive truths about what connects us all as humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This wide-ranging course reveals the method to our madness in everything from finances to Friday the 13th. An expert on irrational behavior, Professor Vyse discusses what it means to be rational before delving into the many reasoning errors and psychological challenges that lead us astray. In fifteen lectures, he will teach you to identify the logical fallacies and quirks of our psychology that tempt us to make unwise decisions. While the course is based in theory, it&#8217;s also teeming with practical advice. You&#8217;ll examine several popular conspiracy theories before exploring the remarkable staying power of common &#8220;bad luck&#8221; superstitions: How did these superstitions come to be? Is it always bad to be irrational? At what point do our beliefs veer into the territory of wishful thinking or willful ignorance? Packed with fun examples and everyday pointers, this course will leave you thinking long and hard about how you think. With Professor Vyse&#8217;s guidance, you&#8217;ll learn to better understand your beliefs and make better decisions.</p>
