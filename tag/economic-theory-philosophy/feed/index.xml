										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The groundbreaking international best-seller that turns everything you think about money, debt, and society on its head&#8211;from the &#8220;brilliant, deeply original political thinker&#8221; David Graeber (Rebecca Solnit, author of Men Explain Things to Me) </p>
<p>                    Before there was money, there was debt. For more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods&#8211;that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors&#8211;which lives on in full force to this day. </p>
<p>                     So says anthropologist David Graeber in a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Renaissance Italy to Imperial China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion (words like &#8220;guilt,&#8221; &#8220;sin,&#8221; and &#8220;redemption&#8221;) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong. </p>
<p>                     We are still fighting these battles today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In  Economic Facts and Fallacies , Thomas Sowell exposes some of the most popular fallacies about economic issues in a lively manner that does not require any prior knowledge of economics. These fallacies include many beliefs widely disseminated in the media and by politicians, such as fallacies about urban problems, income differences, male-female economic differences, as well as economic fallacies about academia, about race, and about Third World countries. Sowell shows that fallacies are not simply crazy ideas but in fact have a certain plausibility that gives them their staying power- and makes careful examination of their flaws both necessary and important.    </p>

<p>                    Discrimination and Disparities gathers a wide array of empirical evidence to challenge the idea that different economic outcomes can be explained by any one factor, be it discrimination, exploitation, or genetics. This revised and enlarged edition also analyzes the human consequences of the prevailing social vision of these disparities and the policies based on that vision&#8211;from educational disasters to widespread crime and violence.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The phenomenal international bestseller that shows us how to stop trying to predict everything &#8211; and take advantage of uncertainty    </p>
<p>                    What have the invention of the wheel, Pompeii, the Wall Street Crash, Harry Potter and the internet got in common? Why are all forecasters  con-artists? Why should you never run for a train or read a newspaper?     </p>
<p>                    This book is all about Black Swans: the random events that underlie our lives, from bestsellers to world disasters. Their impact is huge; they&#8217;re impossible to predict; yet after they happen we always try to rationalize them.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Taleb is a bouncy and even exhilarating  guide &#8230; I came to relish what he said, and even develop a sneaking affection for him as a person&#8217; Will Self, Independent on Sunday    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who is the richest person in the world, ever? Does where you were born affect how much money you&#8217;ll earn over a lifetime? How would we know? Why- beyond the idle curiosity- do these questions even matter? In  The Haves and the Have-Nots , Branko Milanovic, one of the world&#8217;s leading experts on wealth, poverty, and the gap that separates them, explains these and other mysteries of how wealth is unevenly spread throughout our world, now and through time. Milanovic uses history, literature and stories straight out of today&#8217;s newspapers, to discuss one of the major divisions in our social lives: between the haves and the have-nots. He reveals just how rich Elizabeth Bennet&#8217;s suitor Mr. Darcy really was how much Anna Karenina gained by falling in love how wealthy ancient Romans compare to today&#8217;s super-rich where in Kenyan income distribution was Obama&#8217;s grandfather how we should think about Marxism in a modern world and how location where one is born determines his wealth. He goes beyond mere entertainment to explain why inequality matters, how it damages our economics prospects, and how it can threaten the foundations of the social order that we take for granted.  Bold, engaging, and illuminating,  The Haves and the Have-Nots  teaches us not only how to think about inequality, but why we should.</p>

<p>                              Football truly is the world&#8217;s favourite game, followed in over 200 countries by hundreds of millions of people pouring their hearts and souls into supporting their chosen team every week.    </p>
<p>                              But behind the passion are questions that all true football aficionados want to know: why do England lose whilst German and Brazil win? How have Spain conquered the world? Why do so many clubs buy the wrong players?    </p>
<p>                              Fully revised and updated, Soccernomics is the revolutionary guide from an economist and a sports writer who answer all these questions and more.</p>

<p>                    Unforeseen financial crises. Extreme wealth inequality. Relentless pressure on the environment. Can we go on like this? Is there an alternative?    </p>
<p>                    In Doughnut Economics, Oxford academic Kate Raworth lays out the seven deadly mistakes of economics and offers a radical re-envisioning of the system that has brought us to the point of ruin. Moving beyond the myths of &#8216;rational economic man&#8217; and unlimited growth, Doughnut Economics zeroes in on the sweet spot: a system that meets all our needs without exhausting the planet.    </p>
<p>                    The demands of the 21st century require a new shape of economics. This might just be it.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A new, evolutionary explanation of markets and investor behavior  Half of all Americans have money in the stock market, yet economists can&#8217;t agree on whether investors and markets are rational and efficient, as modern financial theory assumes, or irrational and inefficient, as behavioral economists believe&#8211;and as financial bubbles, crashes, and crises suggest. This is one of the biggest debates in economics and the value or futility of investment management and financial regulation hang on the outcome. In this groundbreaking book, Andrew Lo cuts through this debate with a new framework, the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis, in which rationality and irrationality coexist. Drawing on psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and other fields, Adaptive Markets shows that the theory of market efficiency isn&#8217;t wrong but merely incomplete. When markets are unstable, investors react instinctively, creating inefficiencies for others to exploit. Lo&#8217;s new paradigm explains how financial evolution shapes behavior and markets at the speed of thought&#8211;a fact revealed by swings between stability and crisis, profit and loss, and innovation and regulation.<br />
                    A fascinating intellectual journey filled with compelling stories, Adaptive Markets starts with the origins of market efficiency and its failures, turns to the foundations of investor behavior, and concludes with practical implications&#8211;including how hedge funds have become the Galapagos Islands of finance, what really happened in the 2008 meltdown, and how we might avoid future crises. An ambitious new answer to fundamental questions in economics, Adaptive Markets is essential reading for anyone who wants to know how markets really work.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ever  since civilised society began, we have felt the need to classify,  categorise and specialise. It can make things more efficient, and help  give the leaders of any organisation a sense of confidence that they  have the right people focusing on the right tasks. But it can also be  catastrophic, leading to tunnel vision and tribalism. Most importantly  it can create a structural fog, with the full picture of where an  organisation is heading hidden from view. It is incredibly widespread:  the chances are these &#8216;silos&#8217; are rife in any organisation or  profession, whether your business, or your local school or hospital.    </p>
<p>                    Across  industries and cultures, as this brilliant and penetrating book shows,  silos have the power to collapse companies and destabilise financial  markets, yet they still dominate the workplace. They blind and confuse  us, often making modern institutions act in risky, silly and damaging  ways.    </p>
<p>                    Gillian Tett has spent years covering financial markets and  business, but she&#8217;s also a trained anthropologist, having completed a  doctorate at Cambridge University and conducted field work in Tibet and  Tajikistan. She&#8217;s no stranger to questioning the assumptions and  practices of a culture. Those in question &#8211; financial trading desks,  urban police forces, surgical teams within medical clinics, software  debuggers and consumer product engineers &#8211; have practices and rituals as  ordered and intricate as those of any far-flung tribe.    </p>
<p>                    In The Silo Effect,  she uses an anthropological lens to explore how individuals, teams and  whole organisations often work in silos of thought, process and product.  With examples drawn from a range of fascinating areas &#8211; the New York  Fire Department and Facebook to the Bank of England and Sony &#8211; these  narratives illustrate not just how foolishly people can behave when they  are mastered by silos but also how the brightest institutions and  individuals can master them. The Silo Effect is a sharp,  visionary and inspiring work with the insight, prescriptions and power  to remove our organisational blinders and transform the way we think for  the better.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Wonderfully refreshing . . . A must read&#8217; Thomas Piketty     </p>
<p>                    In this revolutionary book, prize-winning economists Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo show how economics, when done right, can help us solve the thorniest social and political problems of our day. From immigration to inequality, slowing growth to accelerating climate change, we have the resources to address the challenges we face but we are so often blinded by ideology.    </p>
<p>                    Original, provocative and urgent, Good Economics for Hard Times offers the new thinking that we need. It builds on cutting-edge research in economics &#8211; and years of exploring the most effective solutions to alleviate extreme poverty &#8211; to make a persuasive case for an intelligent interventionism and a society built on compassion and respect. A much-needed antidote to polarized discourse, this book shines a light to help us appreciate and understand our precariously balanced world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Financial Times Book of the Month pick for April! Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career-record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn&#8217;t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions&#8211;or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven&#8217;t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out&#8211;the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don&#8217;t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel,  Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world&#8217;s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don&#8217;t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager&#8217;s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in the information business (and we all are in the information business), Tercek&#8217;s urgent manifesto will help you see the future, so you can prepare for it.&#8221; &#8211; Seth Godin    </p>
<p>                    Brace yourself for enormous changes ahead. Familiar fixtures of the economic landscape, including retail stores, physical products, corporations and even human workers, are about to be vaporized-replaced by digital information.     </p>
<p>                    A novel combination of new technologies-  mobile, cloud, crowd, artificial intelligence &#8212; are reconfiguring every economic sector and industrial system on the planet. Even industries that were long considered immune to digital transformation are suddenly vulnerable to rapid dematerialization: now automobiles, hotels, health care, and higher education can be replaced by an app-enabled marketplace.    </p>
<p>                    The process of vaporization is relentless and all-pervasive. For consumers this change is as bewildering as it is exhilarating.  For CEOs of old-school firms, the change is terrifying.  But for startup Internet companies, it&#8217;s the greatest landgrab since the Gold Rush.    </p>
<p>                    In Vaporized, innovation expert Robert Tercek shows us how this process works and takes us to the front line of digital transformation. Tercek provides an essential guide to this vaporized world, with proven strategies for those who want to master the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Nobel Prize-winning economist Jean Tirole, a bold new agenda for the role of economics in society  When Jean Tirole won the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economics, he suddenly found himself being stopped in the street by complete strangers and asked to comment on issues of the day, no matter how distant from his own areas of research. His transformation from academic economist to public intellectual prompted him to reflect further on the role economists and their discipline play in society. The result is Economics for the Common Good, a passionate manifesto for a world in which economics, far from being a &#8220;dismal science,&#8221; is a positive force for the common good.  Economists are rewarded for writing technical papers in scholarly journals, not joining in public debates. But Tirole says we urgently need economists to engage with the many challenges facing society, helping to identify our key objectives and the tools needed to meet them.<br />
                    To show how economics can help us realize the common good, Tirole shares his insights on a broad array of questions affecting our everyday lives and the future of our society, including global warming, unemployment, the post-2008 global financial order, the Euro crisis, the digital revolution, innovation, and the proper balance between the free market and regulation.  Providing a rich account of how economics can benefit everyone, Economics for the Common Good sets a new agenda for the role of economics in society.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Selected as a Financial Times Best Book of 2013    </p>
<p>                    Governments today in both Europe and the United States have succeeded in casting government spending as reckless wastefulness that has made the economy worse. In contrast, they have advanced a policy of draconian budget cuts-austerity-to solve the financial crisis. We are told that we have all lived beyond our means and now need to tighten our belts. This view conveniently forgets where all that debt came from. Not from an orgy of government spending, but as the direct result of bailing out,<br />
                    recapitalizing, and adding liquidity to the broken banking system. Through these actions private debt was rechristened as government debt while those responsible for generating it walked away scot free, placing the blame on the state, and the burden on the taxpayer.     </p>
<p>                    That burden now takes the form of a global turn to austerity, the policy of reducing domestic wages and prices to restore competitiveness and balance the budget. The problem, according to political economist Mark Blyth, is that austerity is a very dangerous idea. First of all, it doesn&#8217;t work. As the past four years and countless historical examples from the last 100 years show, while it makes sense for any one state to try and cut its way to growth, it simply cannot work when all states try it<br />
                    simultaneously: all we do is shrink the economy. In the worst case, austerity policies worsened the Great Depression and created the conditions for seizures of power by the forces responsible for the Second World War: the Nazis and the Japanese military establishment. As Blyth amply demonstrates,<br />
                    the arguments for austerity are tenuous and the evidence thin. Rather than expanding growth and opportunity, the repeated revival of this dead economic idea has almost always led to low growth along with increases in wealth and income inequality. Austerity demolishes the conventional wisdom, marshaling an army of facts to demand that we austerity for what it is, and what it costs us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neoliberalism isn&#8217;t working. Austerity is forcing millions into poverty and many more into precarious work, while the left remains trapped in stagnant political practices that offer no respite. Inventing the Future is a bold new manifesto for life after capitalism. Against the confused understanding of our high-tech world by both the right and the left, this book claims that the emancipatory and future-oriented possibilities of our society can be reclaimed. Instead of running from a complex future, Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams demand a postcapitalist economy capable of advancing standards, liberating humanity from work and developing technologies that expand our freedoms. This new edition includes a new chapter where they respond to their various critics.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What is capitalism? Is capitalism the same everywhere? Is there an alternative?     </p>
<p>                    The word &#8216;capitalism&#8217; is one that is heard and used frequently, but what is capitalism really all about, and what does it mean? This Very Short Introduction addresses questions such as &#8216;what is capital?&#8217; before discussing the history and development of capitalism through several detailed case studies, ranging from the tulipomania of 17th century Holland, the Great Depression of the 1930s, and in this new edition, the impact of the global financial crisis that started in 2007-8.    </p>
<p>                    James Fulcher looks at the different forms that capitalism takes in Britain, Japan, Sweden, and the United States, and explores whether capitalism has escaped the nation-state by going global. It ends by asking whether there is an alternative to capitalism, discussing socialism, communal and cooperative experiments, and the alternatives proposed by environmentalists.    </p>
<p>                    ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.</p>

<p>                    &#8220;Delightful.&#8221;-The Economist    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s Santa Claus, Shakespeare, Mickey Mouse, the Bible, and then there&#8217;s Star Wars. Nothing quite compares to sitting down with a young child and hearing the sound of John Williams&#8217;s score as those beloved golden letters fill the screen. In this fun, erudite, and often moving book, Cass R. Sunstein explores the lessons of Star Wars as they relate to childhood, fathers, the Dark Side, rebellion, and redemption. As it turns out, Star Wars also has a lot to teach us about constitutional law, economics, and political uprisings.    </p>
<p>                              In rich detail, Sunstein tells the story of the films&#8217; wildly unanticipated success and explores why some things succeed while others fail. Ultimately, Sunstein argues, Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down. Written with buoyant prose and considerable heart, The World According to Star Wars shines a bright new light on the most beloved story of our time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wealth of research in recent decades has seen the economic approach to human behavior extended over many areas previously considered to belong to sociology, political science, law, and other fields. Research has also shown that economics can provide insight into many aspects of sports, including soccer. Beautiful Game Theory is the first book that uses soccer to test economic theories and document novel human behavior.  In this brilliant and entertaining book, Ignacio Palacios-Huerta illuminates economics through the world&#8217;s most popular sport. He offers unique and often startling insights into game theory and microeconomics, covering topics such as mixed strategies, discrimination, incentives, and human preferences. He also looks at finance, experimental economics, behavioral economics, and neuroeconomics. Soccer provides rich data sets and environments that shed light on universal economic principles in interesting and useful ways.  Essential reading for students, researchers, and sports enthusiasts, Beautiful Game Theory is the first book to show what soccer can do for economics.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Extraordinary innovations in technology promise to transform the world, but how realistic is the claim that AI will change our lives? In this much needed book the acclaimed economist Roger Bootle responds to the fascinating economic questions posed by the age of the robot, steering a path away from tech jargon and alarmism towards a rational explanation of the ways in which the AI revolution will affect us all. Tackling the implications of Artificial Intelligence on growth, productivity, inflation and the distribution of wealth and power, THE AI ECONOMY also examines coming changes to the the way we educate, work and spend our leisure time.    </p>
<p>                    A fundamentally optimistic view which will help you plan for changing times, this book explains AI and leads you towards a more certain future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In Why Information Grows, rising star Cesar Hidalgo offers a radical interpretation of global economics    </p>
<p>                    What is economic growth? And why, historically, has it occurred in only a few places? Previous efforts to answer these questions have focused on institutions, geography, finances, and psychology. But MIT professor Cesar Hidalgo argues that in order to fully grasp the nature of economic growth we need to transcend the social sciences and turn to the science of information, networks and complexity. The growth of economies, he explains, is deeply connected with the growth of order &#8211; or information.    </p>
<p>                    At first glance, the universe seems hostile to order. Thermodynamics dictates that over time, order will disappear. But thermodynamics also has loopholes that promote the growth of information in pockets. Our cities are such pockets where information grows, but they are not all the same. For every Silicon Valley, Tokyo, and London, there are dozens of places with underdeveloped economies. Why does the US economy outstrip Brazil&#8217;s, and Brazil&#8217;s that of Chad? Why did the technology corridor along Boston&#8217;s Route 128 languish while Silicon Valley blossomed? In each case, the key is how people, companies, and the networks they form process information &#8211; it is all about their knowledge, knowhow and imagination. As Hidalgo compellingly shows, economies are made of networks of people and society is a collective computer. The problem of economic development is in fact the problem of making these networks more powerful.    </p>
<p>                    A radical new interpretation of global economics, Why Information Grows overturns traditional assumptions about the development of economies and the origins of wealth and takes a crucial step toward making economics less the dismal science and more the insightful one.</p>

Each is an example of how an iconic company was defined by a particular moment of fame or notoriety. These notable and fascinating accounts are as relevant today to understanding the intricacies of corporate life as they were when the events happened.Stories about Wall Street are infused with drama and adventure and reveal the machinations and volatile nature of the world of finance. John Brooks&#8217;s insightful reportage is so full of personality and critical detail that whether he is looking at the astounding market crash of 1962, the collapse of a well-known brokerage firm, or the bold attempt by American bankers to save the British pound, one gets the sense that history really does repeat itself.This business classic written by longtime New Yorker contributor John Brooks is an insightful and engaging look into corporate and financial life in America.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Burnham has real intellectual courage, and writes about real issues.&#8217; &#8211; George Orwell    </p>
<p>                    Burnham&#8217;s claim was that capitalism was dead, but that it was being replaced not by socialism, but a new economic system he called &#8220;managerialism&#8221;; rule by managers.    </p>
<p>                    Written in 1941, this is the book that theorised how the world was moving into the hands of the &#8216;managers&#8217;. Burnham explains how Capitalism had virtually lost its control, and would be displaced not by labour, nor by socialism, but by the rule of administartors in business and in government.    </p>
<p>                    This revolution, he posited, is as broad as the world and as comprehensive as human society, asking &#8220;Why is &#8216;totalitarianism&#8217; not the issue?&#8221; &#8220;Can civilization be destroyed?&#8221; And &#8220;Why is the New Deal something bigger than Roosevelt can handle?&#8221;    </p>
<p>                    In a volume extraordinary for its dispassionate handling of those and other fundamental questions, James Burnham explores fully the implications of the managerial revolution.</p>

                      One of Intercollegiate Studies Institute&#8217;s 50 Best Books of the 20th Century  How can we benefit from the promise of government while avoiding the threat it poses to individual freedom? In this classic book, Milton Friedman provides the definitive statement of an immensely influential economic philosophy&#8211;one in which competitive capitalism serves as both a device for achieving economic freedom and a necessary condition for political freedom.     </p>
<p>                     First published in 1962, Friedman&#8217;s Capitalism and Freedom is one of the most significant works of economic theory ever written. Enduring in its eminence and esteem, it has sold nearly a million copies in English, has been translated into eighteen languages, and continues to inform economic thinking and policymaking around the world. This new edition includes prefaces written by Friedman for both the 1982 and 2002 reissues of the book, as well as a new foreword by Binyamin Appelbaum, lead economics writer for the New York Times editorial board.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why doesn&#8217;t the explosive growth of companies like Facebook and Uber deliver more prosperity for everyone?     </p>
<p>                    What is the systemic problem that sets the rich against the poor and the technologists against everybody else?     </p>
<p>                    When protesters shattered the windows of a bus carrying Google employees to work, their anger may have been justifiable, but it was misdirected. The true conflict of our age isn&#8217;t between the unem­ployed and the digital elite, or even the 99 percent and the 1 percent. Rather, a tornado of technological improvements has spun our economic program out of control, and humanity as a whole&#8211;the protesters and the Google employees as well as the shareholders and the executives&#8211;are all trapped by the consequences. It&#8217;s time to optimize our economy for the human beings it&#8217;s supposed to be serving.     </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking book, acclaimed media scholar and author Douglas Rushkoff tells us how to combine the best of human nature with the best of modern technology. Tying together disparate threads&#8211;big data, the rise of robots and AI, the increasing participation of algorithms in stock market trading, the gig economy, the collapse of the eurozone&#8211;Rushkoff provides a critical vocabulary for our economic moment and a nuanced portrait of humans and commerce at a critical crossroads.</p>
