										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Patterson returns to the genre that made him famous with a #1 New York Times bestselling teen detective novel about the mysterious Angel family . . . and the dark secrets they&#8217;re keeping from one another.<br />
                    On the night Malcolm and Maud Angel are murdered, Tandy Angel knows just three things: 1) She was the last person to see her parents alive. 2) The police have no suspects besides Tandy and her three siblings. 3) She can&#8217;t trust anyone-maybe not even herself.<br />
                    As Tandy sets out to clear the family name, she begins to recall flashes of experiences long buried in her vulnerable psyche. These memories shed light on her family&#8217;s dark secrets, and digging deeper into her powerful parents&#8217; affairs proves to be a disturbing and dangerous game. Who knows what any of the Angels are truly capable of?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An irreverent and irresistible New York Times bestselling romance between the so-called Designated Ugly Fat Friend and the Hot Jock.      </p>
<p>                    Seventeen-year-old Bianca Piper may not be the prettiest girl in her high school, but she has a loyal group of friends, a biting wit, and a spot-on BS detector. She&#8217;s also way too smart to fall for the charms of man-slut and slimy school hottie Wesley Rush, who calls Bianca the Duff&#8211;the Designated Ugly Fat Friend&#8211;of her crew.     </p>
<p>                    But things aren&#8217;t so great at home and Bianca, desperate for a distraction, ends up kissing Wesley. Worse, she likes it. Eager for escape, Bianca throws herself into a closeted enemies-with-benefits relationship with him.     </p>
<p>                    Until it all goes horribly awry. It turns out Wesley isn&#8217;t such a bad listener, and his life is pretty screwed up, too. Suddenly Bianca realizes with absolute horror that she&#8217;s falling for the guy she thought she hated more than anyone.</p>

<p>                    From wharf fights and school brawls to crumbling lives inside glittery mansions, one guy tries to save himself.    </p>
<p>                    Reed Royal has it all-looks, status, money. The girls at his elite prep school line up to date him, the guys want to be him, but Reed never gave a damn about anyone but his family until Ella Harper walked into his life.    </p>
<p>                    What started off as burning resentment and the need to make his father&#8217;s new ward suffer turned into something else entirely-keep Ella close. Keep Ella safe. But when one foolish mistake drives her out of Reed&#8217;s arms and brings chaos to the Royal household, Reed&#8217;s entire world begins to fall apart around him.    </p>
<p>                    Ella doesn&#8217;t want him anymore. She says they&#8217;ll only destroy each other.    </p>
<p>                    She might be right.    </p>
<p>                    Secrets. Betrayal. Enemies. It&#8217;s like nothing Reed has ever dealt with before, and if he&#8217;s going to win back his princess, he&#8217;ll need to prove himself Royally worthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An epic clash between gods and mortals threatens to tear Mytica apart . . . and prove that not even the purest of love stands a chance against the strongest of magic.     </p>
<p>                    MAGNUS and CLEO are forced to test the strength of their love when Gaius returns to Mytica claiming he&#8217;s no longer the King of Blood but a changed man seeking redemption.     </p>
<p>                    LUCIA, pregnant with the child of a Watcher, has escaped the clutches of the unhinged fire god. Her powers are dwindling as she goes forth to fulfill a prophecy that will keep her baby safe . . . but could mean her demise.     </p>
<p>                    JONAS treks back to Mytica with a plan to overtake Amara, but fate takes hold when he runs into the beautiful Princess Lucia and joins her on her perilous journey.     </p>
<p>                    AMARA has taken the Mytican throne, but with no way to unleash the water magic trapped within her stolen crystal, she&#8217;ll never be able to seize glory and get sweet revenge.     </p>
<p>                    And what kind of darkness will descend&#8211;and who will be safe&#8211;after Prince Ashur reveals the dangerous price he paid to cheat death?</p>
