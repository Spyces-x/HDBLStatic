										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twentieth Anniversary Edition with Contributions from Joe Hill and Owen King </p>
<p>                    Immensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King&#8217;s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.</p>
<p>                     Part memoir, part masterclass by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer&#8217;s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. </p>
<p>                    King&#8217;s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999 &#8211; and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it &#8211; fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;SOMETIMES&#8230;DEAD IS BETTER&#8217;</p>
<p>                    The house looked right, felt right to Dr Louis Creed.</p>
<p>                    Rambling, old, unsmart and comfortable. A place where the family could settle; the children grow and play and explore. The rolling hills and meadows of Maine seemed a world away from the fume-choked dangers of Chicago.</p>
<p>                    Only the occasional big truck out on the two-lane highway, grinding up through the gears, hammering down the long gradients, growled out an intrusive threat.</p>
<p>                    But behind the house and far away from the road: that was safe. Just a carefully cleared path up into the woods where generations of local children have processed with the solemn innocence of the young, taking with them their dear departed pets for burial.</p>
<p>                    A sad place maybe, but safe. Surely a safe place. Not a place to seep into your dreams, to wake you, sweating with fear and foreboding.</p>
<p>                    &#8216;King can make the flesh creep half a world away&#8217; &#8211; The Times<br />
                    &#8216;So beautifully paced that you cannot help but be pulled in&#8217; &#8211; Guardian<br />
                    &#8216;The most frightening novel Stephen King has ever written&#8217; &#8211; Publisher&#8217;s Weekly<br />
                    &#8216;Wild, powerful, disturbing&#8217; &#8211; Washington Post Book Review</p>

<p>                    Fascinating facts, trivia, and little-known details about the Master of the Macabre&#8217;s life and work, plus interviews, essays, and insights for King fans, from the casual to the fanatical!</p>
<p>                    Did you know&#8230;?</p>
<p>                    In his early teens, Stephen King sold typed copies of his short stories at school.<br />
                    King originally thought his novel Pet Sematary was too frightening to publish.<br />
                    King&#8217;s legendary Dark Tower series took him more than 30 years to write.<br />
                    Thinner was the novel that revealed his &#8220;Richard Bachman&#8221; pseudonym to the world.<br />
                    King wrote The Eyes of the Dragon for his daughter Naomi.<br />
                    He has never liked Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s film version of his novel The Shining.<br />
                    It took him four years to write what some consider his magnum opus, IT.<br />
                    The 2017 film version of IT has grossed more than $700 million worldwide.<br />
                    In addition to novels, King has written essays, plays, screenplays, and even poetry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive history of the flamboyant life of Ian Fleming and his most famous creation, James Bond.    </p>
<p>                    This new biography of Ian Fleming presents a fresh and illuminating portrayal of the iconic creator of James Bond. Oliver Buckton provides the first in-depth exploration of the entire process of Ian Fleming&#8217;s writing-from initial conception, through composition, to his involvement in the innovative publication methods of his books. He also investigates the vital impact of Fleming&#8217;s work in naval intelligence during World War Two on his later writings, especially the wartime operations he planned and executed and how they drove the plots of the James Bond novels. Buckton considers the vital role of wartime deception, disinformation, and propaganda in shaping Fleming&#8217;s later techniques and imaginative creations. Offering a radically new view of Fleming&#8217;s relationships with women, Buckton traces the role of strong, independent, and intelligent women such as Maud Russell, Phyllis Bottome, and his wife, Ann, on Fleming&#8217;s portrayal of female characters. The book concludes with a thorough analysis of the James Bond films from Eon productions, and their influence in promoting, while also distorting, the public&#8217;s recognition of Fleming&#8217;s writing.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.&#8217; The prophetic words of Galadriel, addressed to Frodo as he prepared to travel from Lothlorien to Mordor to destroy the One Ring, are just as pertinent to J R R Tolkien&#8217;s own fiction. For decades, hobbits and the other fantastical creatures of Middle-earth have captured the imaginations of a fiercely loyal tribe of readers, all enhanced by the immense success of Peter Jackson&#8217;s films: first &#8220;The Lord of the Rings&#8221;, and now his new &#8220;The Hobbit&#8221;. But for all Tolkien&#8217;s global fame and the familiarity of modern culture with Gandalf, Bilbo, Frodo and Sam, the sources of the great mythmaker&#8217;s own myth-making have been neglected. Mark Atherton here explores the chief influences on Tolkien&#8217;s work: his boyhood in the West Midlands; the landscapes and seascapes which shaped his mythologies; his experiences in World War I; his interest in Scandinavian myth; his friendships, especially with the other Oxford-based Inklings; and the relevance of his themes, especially ecological themes, to the present-day.<br />
                    &#8220;There and Back Again&#8221; offers a unique guide to the varied inspirations behind Tolkien&#8217;s life and work, and sheds new light on how a legend is born.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was not long after Halloween when Stephen King received a telephone call from his editor. &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you do a book about the entire horror phenomenon as you see it? Books, movies, radio, TV, the whole thing.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    The result is this unique combination of fantasy and autobiography, of classic horror writing honed to an unforgettable edge by the bestselling master of the genre.    </p>
<p>                    DANSE MACABRE ranges across the whole spectrum of horror in popular culture from the seminal classics of Dracula and Frankenstein. It is a charming and fascinating book, replete with pertinent anecdote and observation, in which Stephen King describes his ideas on how horror works on many levels and how he brings it to bear on his own inimitable novels.    </p>
<p>                    There is a reason why Stephen King is one of the bestselling writers in the world, ever. Described in the Guardian as an author who &#8216;knows how to engage the deepest sympathies of his readers&#8217;, Stephen King writes books that draw you in and are impossible to put down.    </p>
