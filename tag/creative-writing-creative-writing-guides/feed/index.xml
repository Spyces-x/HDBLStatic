										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twentieth Anniversary Edition with Contributions from Joe Hill and Owen King </p>
<p>                    Immensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King&#8217;s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.</p>
<p>                     Part memoir, part masterclass by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer&#8217;s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. </p>
<p>                    King&#8217;s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999 &#8211; and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it &#8211; fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Steven Pinker, the bestselling author of The Language Instinct, deploys his gift for explaining big ideas in The Sense of Style &#8211; an entertaining writing guide for the 21st century    </p>
<p>                    What is the secret of good prose? Does writing well even matter in an age of instant communication? Should we care? In this funny, thoughtful book about the modern art of writing, Steven Pinker shows us why we all need a sense of style.    </p>
<p>                    More than ever before, the currency of our social and cultural lives is the written word, from Twitter and texting to blogs, e-readers and old-fashioned books. But most style guides fail to prepare people for the challenges of writing in the 21st century, portraying it as a minefield of grievous errors rather than a form of pleasurable mastery. They fail to deal with an inescapable fact about language: it changes over time, adapted by millions of writers and speakers to their needs. Confusing changes in the world with moral decline, every generation believes the kids today are degrading society and taking language with it. A guide for the new millennium, writes Steven Pinker, has to be different.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the latest research in linguistics and cognitive science, Steven Pinker replaces the recycled dogma of previous style guides with reason and evidence. This thinking person&#8217;s guide to good writing shows why style still matters: in communicating effectively, in enhancing the spread of ideas, in earning a reader&#8217;s trust and, not least, in adding beauty to the world. Eye-opening, mind-expanding and cheerful, The Sense of Style shows that good style is part of what it means to be human.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This guide reveals how writers can utilize cognitive storytelling strategies to craft stories that ignite readers&#8217; brains and captivate them through each plot element.     </p>
<p>                    Imagine knowing what the brain craves from every tale it encounters, what fuels the success of any great story, and what keeps readers transfixed. Wired for Story reveals these cognitive secrets&#8211;and it&#8217;s a game-changer for anyone who has ever set pen to paper.     </p>
<p>                    The vast majority of writing advice focuses on &#8220;writing well&#8221; as if it were the same as telling a great story. This is exactly where many aspiring writers fail&#8211;they strive for beautiful metaphors, authentic dialogue, and interesting characters, losing sight of the one thing that every engaging story must do: ignite the brain&#8217;s hardwired desire to learn what happens next. When writers tap into the evolutionary purpose of story and electrify our curiosity, it triggers a delicious dopamine rush that tells us to pay attention. Without it, even the most perfect prose won&#8217;t hold anyone&#8217;s interest.     </p>
<p>                    Backed by recent breakthroughs in neuroscience as well as examples from novels, screenplays, and short stories, Wired for Story offers a revolutionary look at story as the brain experiences it. Each chapter zeroes in on an aspect of the brain, its corresponding revelation about story, and the way to apply it to your storytelling right now.</p>

<p>                    For a quarter century, more than a million readers&#8211;scribes and scribblers of all ages and abilities&#8211;have been inspired by Anne Lamott&#8217;s hilarious, big-hearted, homespun advice. Advice that begins with the simple words of wisdom passed down from Anne&#8217;s father&#8211;also a writer&#8211;in the iconic passage that gives the book its title:     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Thirty years ago my older brother, who was ten years old at the time, was trying to get a report on birds written that he&#8217;d had three months to write. It was due the next day. We were out at our family cabin in Bolinas, and he was at the kitchen table close to tears, surrounded by binder paper and pencils and unopened books on birds, immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him, put his arm around my brother&#8217;s shoulder, and said, &#8216;Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird.'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Harry Evans has edited everything from the urgent files of battlefield reporters to the complex thought processes of Henry Kissinger, and he has been knighted for his services to journalism. In Do I Make Myself Clear?,his definitive guide to writing well, Evans brings his indispensable insight to the art of clear communication.    </p>
<p>                    The right words are oxygen to our ideas, but the digital era, with all of its TTYL, LMK and WTF, has been cutting off that oxygen flow. The compulsion to be precise has vanished from our culture, and in writing of all kinds we see a trend towards more &#8211; more speed and more information, but far less clarity. Evans provides practical examples of how editing and rewriting can make for better communication, even in the digital age.    </p>
<p>                    DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR? is an essential text, and one that will provide every reader an editor at their shoulder.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re someone who dreams of penning a bestseller, read this book&#8217; The Week    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;What if the success of E.L.James and Dan Brown was not so random? What  if there were an algorithm that could pick out the bestseller DNA  concealed within these books before they&#8217;re published? This is the  audacious claim made by Jodie Archer and Matthew Jockers &#8230; Smart,  savvy and full of ideas&#8217; Fiona Wilson, The Times    </p>
<p>                    Girl on the Train. Fifty Shades. The Goldfinch. Why do some books capture the whole world&#8217;s attention? In The Bestseller Code, Archer and Jockers boldly claim that not only can mega-hits be explained and identified &#8211; but they&#8217;ve built the algorithm to prove it. Using cutting-edge text mining techniques, they have developed a model that analyses theme, plot, style and character  to explain why some books resonate more than others with readers. Provocative, entertaining, and ground-breaking, The Bestseller Code explores the hidden patterns at work in the biggest hits and, more importantly, the real reasons we love to read.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Non-formulaic, eye-opening, deeply-researched &#8211; and really worth your time&#8217; GQ    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;When a story captures the imagination of millions, that&#8217;s magic. Can  you qualify magic? Archer and Jockers just may have done so&#8217; Sylvia Day,  no.1 bestselling author    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;The claims are eye-grabbing . . . and also highly plausible&#8217; Robert Douglas-Fairhurst, Spectator    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Thought-provoking and interesting &#8230; Here is a book worth reading&#8217; David Bond, Financial Times</p>

<p>                    Long before there were creative writing workshops and degrees, how did aspiring writers learn to write? By reading the work of their predecessors and contemporaries, says Francine Prose.     </p>
<p>                     As she takes us on a guided tour of the tools and the tricks of the masters&#8211;Dostoyevsky, Flaubert, Kafka, Austen, Dickens, Woolf, Chekhov&#8211;Prose discovers why these writers endure. She takes pleasure in the signature elements of such outsatanding writers as Philip Roth, Isaac Babel, John Le Carré, James Joyce, and Katherine Mansfield. Throughout, she cautions readers to slow down and pay attention to words, the raw material out of which literature is crafted. Written with passion, humor, and wisdom, Reading Like a Writer will inspire readers to return to literature with a fresh eye and an eager heart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>
