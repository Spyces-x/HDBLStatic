										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Now in paperback, NY Times best-selling author Dr. Michael Roizen&#8217;s groundbreaking book reveals how the food choices you make each day&#8211;and when you make them&#8211;can affect your health, your energy, your sex life, your waistline, your attitude, and how you age.    </p>
<p>                     What if eating two cups of blueberries a day could prevent cancer? If drinking a kale-infused smoothie could counteract missing an hour&#8217;s worth of sleep? When is the right time of day to eat that chocolate chip cookies? And would you actually drink that glass of water if it meant skipping the gym? This revolutionary guide&#8211;Dr. Mehmet Oz&#8217;s 2019 Diet of the Year&#8211;reveals how to use food to enhance our personal and professional lives, and increase our longevity to boot.     </p>
<p>                     What to Eat When is not a diet book. Instead, acclaimed Cleveland Clinic internist Michael Roizen and certified physician Michael Crupain offer reader the choices that will benefit them the most&#8211;whether it&#8217;s meals to help them look younger or snacks that prevent diseases&#8211;based on the science that governs them.</p>
