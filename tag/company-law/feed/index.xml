										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What went wrong with American business at the end of the 20th century?    </p>
<p>                    Until the spring of 2001, Enron epitomized the triumph of the New Economy. Feared by rivals, worshipped by investors, Enron seemingly could do no wrong. Its profits rose every year; its stock price surged ever upward; its leaders were hailed as visionaries.      </p>
<p>                    Then a young Fortune writer, Bethany McLean, wrote an article posing a simple question &#8211;  how, exactly, does Enron make its money?    </p>
<p>                    Within a year Enron was facing humiliation and bankruptcy, the largest in US history, which caused Americans to lose faith in a system that rewarded top insiders with millions of dollars, while small investors lost everything. It was revealed that Enron was a company whose business was an illusion, an illusion that Wall Street was willing to accept even though they knew what the real truth was.  This book &#8211; fully updated for the paperback &#8211; tells the extraordinary story of Enron&#8217;s fall.</p>
