<p>                    TIE IN TO A NEW MAJOR MOTION PICTURE, IT: CHAPTER 2, ADAPTED FROM KING&#8217;S TERRIFYING CLASSIC</p>
<p>                    27 years later, the Losers Club have grown up and moved away, until a devastating phone call brings them back&#8230;</p>
<p>                    Derry, Maine was just an ordinary town: familiar, well-ordered for the most part, a good place to live.</p>
<p>                    It was a group of children who saw- and felt- what made Derry so horribly different. In the storm drains, in the sewers, IT lurked, taking on the shape of every nightmare, each one&#8217;s deepest dread. Sometimes IT appeared as an evil clown named Pennywise and sometimes IT reached up, seizing, tearing, killing . . .</p>
<p>                    Time passed and the children grew up, moved away and forgot. THEN they are called back, once more to confront IT as IT stirs and coils in the sullen depths of their memories, emerging again to make their past nightmares a terrible present reality&#8230;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;They&#8217;ll float&#8230;and when you&#8217;re down here with me, you&#8217;ll float too&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The definitive work on the extraordinary phenomenon of out-of-body experiences, by the founder of the internationally known Monroe Institute. </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe, a Virginia businessman, began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbound by time or death. </p>
<p>                    Praise for Journeys Out of the Body </p>
<p>                    Monroe&#8217;s account of his travels, Journeys Out of the Body, jam-packed with parasitic goblins and dead humans, astral sex, scary trips into mind-boggling other dimensions, and practical tips on how to get out of your body, all told with wry humor, quickly became a cult sensation with its publication in 1971, and has been through many printings. Whatever their &#8216;real&#8217; explanation, Monroe&#8217;s trips made for splendid reading. &#8211;Michael Hutchinson, author of Megabrain </p>
<p>                    Robert Monroe&#8217;s experiences are probably the most intriguing of any person&#8217;s of our time, with the possible exception of Carlos Castaneda&#8217;s. &#8211;Joseph Chilton Pierce, author of Magical Child </p>
<p>                    This book is by a person who&#8217;s clearly a sensible man and who&#8217;s trying to tell it like it is. No ego trips. Just a solid citizen who&#8217;s been &#8216;out&#8217; a thousand times now and wants to pass his experiences to others. &#8211;The Last Whole Earth Catalog</p>

<p>                    In December 1975, the Lutz family moved into their new home on suburban Long Island. George and Kathleen Lutz knew that, one year earlier, Ronald DeFeo had murdered his parents, brothers, and sisters in the house, but the property&#8211;complete with boathouse and swimming pool&#8211;and the price had been too good to pass up.     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 1958, a successful businessman named Robert Mornroe began to have experiences that drastically altered his life. Unpredictably, and without his willing it, Monroe found himself leaving his physical body to travel via a second body to locales far removed from the physical and spiritual realities of his life. He was inhabiting a place unbounded by life or death.     </p>
<p>                    Monroe recorded these experiences in two bestselling, landmark books, Journeys Out of the Body and Far Journeys. Ultimate Journey, his final and career-defining work, takes us further than we thought possible&#8211;and reveals to us what it all means.     </p>
<p>                    Ultimate Journey charts that area which lies over the edge, beyond the limits of the physical world. It presents us with a map of the interstate&#8211;the route that opens to us when we leave our physical lives, with their entry and exit ramps, their singposts and their hazards. It also tells us how Monroe found the route and travelled it, and uncovered the reason and the purpose of this pioneering expedition. It is a journey that reveals basic truths about the meaning and purpose of life&#8211;and of what lies beyond.    </p>
