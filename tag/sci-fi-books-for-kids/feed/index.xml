										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Penultimate Peril, the siblings face a harpoon gun, a rooftop sunbathing salon, two mysterious initials, three unidentified triplets, a notorious villain, and an unsavoury curry&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is only one book to a man,&#8217; Steinbeck wrote of East of Eden, his most ambitious novel. Set in the rich farmland of the Salinas Valley, California, this powerful, often brutal novel, follows the intertwined destinies of two families &#8211; the Trasks and the Hamiltons &#8211; whose generations hopelessly re-enact the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain and Abel. Here Steinbeck created some of his most memorable characters and explored his most enduring themes: the mystery of identity; the inexplicability of love, and the murderous consequences of love&#8217;s absence.    </p>

<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Hostile Hospital the siblings face a suspicious shopkeeper, unnecessary surgery, heart-shaped balloons, and some very startling news about a fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s A Series of Unfortunate Events but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                                In The Miserable Mill the siblings encounter a giant pincher machine, a bad casserole, a man with a cloud of smoke where his head should be, a hypnotist, a terrible accident and coupons.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, A Series of Unfortunate Events has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series directed by Barry Sonnenfeld. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling The Hunger Games, with an all-new cover from the major motion picture!<br />
                    The astonishing bestseller is now a blockbuster movie. Here is the original novel with new movie artwork on the cover. (Original cover version also available.) In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead and survival, for her, is second nature. Without really meaning to, she becomes a contender. But if she is to win, she will have to start making choices that weigh survival against humanity and life against love.    </p>

<p>                              You still have time to choose another international best-seller to read. But if you must know what unpleasantries befall the charming and clever Baudelaire children read on &#8230;</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival contains such a distressing story that consuming any of its contents would be far more stomach-turning than even the most imbalanced meal. To avoid causing discomfort, it would be best if I didn&#8217;t mention any of the ingredients of this story, particularly a confusing map, an ambidextrous person, an unruly crowd, a wooden plank and Chabo the Wolf Baby. Your time might be better filled with something more palatable such as eating your vegetables or feeding them to someone else.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Vile Village the siblings face such unpleasant matters as migrating crows, an angry mob, a newspaper headline, the arrest of innocent people, the Deluxe cell, and some very strange hats.</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>

<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All her life, Spensa has dreamed of becoming a pilot. Of proving she&#8217;s a hero like her father. She made it to the sky, but the truths she learned about her father were crushing. The rumours of his cowardice are true &#8211; he deserted his flight during battle against the Krell. Worse, though, he turned against his team and attacked them. </p>
<p>                     Spensa is sure there&#8217;s more to the story. And she&#8217;s sure that whatever happened to her father in his starship could happen to her. When she made it outside the protective shell of her planet, she heard the stars &#8211; and it was terrifying. What she learned turned her world upside down. Everything Spensa&#8217;s been taught is a lie. </p>
<p>                     But Spensa also learned a few things about herself &#8211; and she&#8217;ll travel to the end of the galaxy to save humankind if she needs to. </p>
<p>                    Praise for Brandon Sanderson&#8217;s #1 New York Times Bestselling Reckoners series:</p>
<p>                     &#8216;Another win for Sanderson . . . he&#8217;s simply a brilliant writer&#8217; Patrick Rothfuss<br />
                     &#8216;Action-packed&#8217; Entertainment Weekly<br />
                     &#8216;Compelling . . . Sanderson uses plot twists that he teases enough for readers to pick up on to distract from the more dramatic reveals he has in store&#8217; AV Club</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Blood of Olympus is the fifth book in the bestselling Heroes of Olympus series &#8211; set in the high-octane world of Percy Jackson.</p>
<p>                    Though the Greek and Roman crew members of the Argo II have made progress in  their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother,  Gaea. Her giants have risen &#8211; all of them &#8211; and they&#8217;re stronger than ever. </p>
<p>                    They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods  sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood -the blood of Olympus &#8211; in order to  wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp  Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost  within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to  Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs  back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps.  The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east.</p>
<p>                    The gods, still  suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of  young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea&#8217;s army of powerful giants? As  dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have  sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over&#8230;</p>
<p>                            Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Slippery Slope the siblings face a secret message, a toboggan, a deceitful trap, a swarm of snow gnats and a scheming villain&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>

<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Come to Chasm City and embark on a mind-bending ride through the universe of Revelation Space    </p>
<p>                    Tanner Mirabel was a security specialist who never made a mistake &#8211; until the day a woman in his care was blown away by Argent Reivich, a vengeful young postmortal. Tanner&#8217;s pursuit of Reivich takes him across light-years of space to Chasm City, the domed human settlement on the otherwise inhospitable planet of Yellowstone.    </p>
<p>                    But Chasm City is not what it was. The one time high-tech utopia has become a Gothic nightmare: a nanotechnological virus has corrupted the city&#8217;s inhabitants as thoroughly as it has the buildings and machines. Before the chase is done, Tanner will have to confront truths which reach back centuries, towards deep space and an atrocity history barely remembers.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Take another awe-inspiring leap into the darkly imagined future of REVELATION SPACE, where it is time for Humanity to meet its Unmakers.    </p>
<p>                    Mankind has endured centuries of horrific plague and a particularly brutal interstellar war &#8230; but there is still no time for peace and quiet.    </p>
<p>                    Stirred from aeons of sleep, the Inhibitors &#8211; ancient alien killing machines &#8211; have begun the process of ridding the galaxy of its latest emergent intelligence: mankind. As a ragtag bag of refugees fleeing the first wave of the cull head towards an apparently insignificant moon light-years away, they discover an avenging angel, a girl born in ice. She has the power to lead mankind to safety, and the ability to draw down their darkest enemy.    </p>
<p>                    And on a planet where vast travelling cathedrals crawl towards the treacherous fissure known as Absolution Gap, an unsettling truth becomes apparent: to beat one enemy, it may be necessary to forge an alliance with something much, much worse &#8230;    </p>

<p>                    When poor farm boy Eragon finds a polished stone in the forest, he thinks it&#8217;s a lucky discovery. Perhaps, he will be able to buy his family food for the winter.     </p>
<p>                    But, when a baby dragon hatches out of the stone, Eragon realises he&#8217;s stumbled upon a legacy nearly as old as the Empire itself.     </p>
<p>                    His simple life is shattered, and he&#8217;s thrust into a perilous new world of destiny, magic and power. To navigate this dark terrain, and survive his cruel king&#8217;s evil ways, he must take up the mantle of the legendary Dragon Riders.     </p>
<p>                    Will he succeed? The fate of the Empire rests in his hands. . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the New York Times bestselling author of the Sisters Grimm and NERDS comes the second book in an action-packed middle grade series with equal parts humor and heart!     </p>
<p>                    When Finn is saved from the Time Rangers by an older version of himself, it comes with a catch. Old Man Finn needs Finn and his friends, Lincoln and Julep, to help him win battles he lost years ago against the Paradox, a terrible creatures obsessed with revenge against Finn&#8217;s father. If they succeed, he promises to tell Finn where his father is. He even gives them a pair of time-traveling pajamas to help them with their quest.     </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s only one problem. The pajamas malfunction almost immediately. Along the way the kids avoid being eaten by sabretooths, shot by revolutionary war soldiers, and start a war with a town full of holograms, all in an effort to fix the jammies.     </p>
<p>                    Just when their goal is in sight, Julep gets sick. Only&#8230;it doesn&#8217;t seem like she&#8217;s sick. It seems like she&#8217;s changing. The adventure may cost Finn more than an old pair of pajamas&#8211;it may cost him his friends!    </p>

                    The second installment in Rick Riordan&#8217;s blockbuster Norse mythology series has Magnus and friends helping the god of thunder find his missing weapon before all Muspellheim breaks loose.<br />
                    Thor&#8217;s hammer is missing again. The thunder god has a disturbing habit of misplacing his weapon&#8211;the mightiest force in the Nine Worlds. But this time the hammer isn&#8217;t just lost, it has fallen into enemy hands.<br />
                    If Magnus Chase and his friends can&#8217;t retrieve the hammer quickly, the mortal worlds will be defenseless against an onslaught of giants. Ragnarok will begin. The Nine Worlds will burn.<br />
                    Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer&#8217;s return is the gods&#8217; worst enemy, Loki&#8211;and the price he wants is very high.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Throne of Fire: the second book in Rick Riordan&#8217;s The Kane Chronicles.</p>
<p>                    EVER since the gods of Ancient Egypt were unleashed on the modern world, Carter Kane and his sister, Sadie, have been in big trouble.</p>
<p>                    As descendants of the magical House of Life, they command certain powers. But now a terrifying enemy &#8211; Apophis, the giant snake of chaos &#8211; is rising. </p>
<p>                    If Carter and Sadie don&#8217;t destroy him, the world will end in five days&#8217; time. And in order to battle the forces of chaos, they must revive the sun god Ra &#8211; a feat no magician has ever achieved. Because first they must search the world for the three sections of the Book of Ra, then they have to learn how to chant its spells . . .</p>
<p>                    Can the Kanes destroy Apophis before he swallows the sun and plunges the earth into darkness . . . forever?</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>
<p>                    Praise for the Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Witty and inspired. Gripping, touching and deliciously satirical&#8230;This is most likely to succeed Rowling. Puffin is on to a winner&#8217; &#8211; Amanda Craig, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Puns, jokes and subtle wit, alongside a gripping storyline&#8217; &#8211; Telegraph</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                    The Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    The Lightning Thief; The Sea of Monsters; The Battle of the Labyrinth; The Titan&#8217;s Curse; The Last Olympian </p>
<p>                    Heroes of Olympus:</p>
<p>                    The Lost Hero; The Son of Neptune; The Mark of Athena</p>
<p>                    The Kane Chronicles:</p>
<p>                    The Red Pyramid; The Throne of Fire; The Serpent&#8217;s Shadow</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear reader,</p>
<p>                              There is nothing to be found in Lemony Snicket&#8217;s &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; but misery and despair. You still have time to choose another international best-selling series to read. But if you insist on discovering the unpleasant adventures of the Baudelaire orphans, then proceed with caution&#8230;</p>
<p>                              Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are intelligent children. They are charming, and resourceful, and have pleasant facial features. Unfortunately, they are exceptionally unlucky.</p>
<p>                              In The Grim Grotto, the siblings face mushrooms, a desperate search for something lost, a mechanical monster, a distressing message from a lost friend, and tap dancing&#8230;</p>
<p>                              In the tradition of great storytellers, from Dickens to Dahl, comes an exquisitely dark comedy that is both literary and irreverent, hilarious and deftly crafted.</p>
<p>                              Despite their wretched contents, &#8216;A Series of Unfortunate Events&#8217; has sold 60 million copies worldwide and been made into a Hollywood film starring Jim Carrey. And in the future things are poised to get much worse, thanks to the forthcoming Netflix series starring Neil Patrick Harris. You have been warned.</p>
<p>                              Are you unlucky enough to own all 13 adventures?</p>
<p>                              The Bad Beginning</p>
<p>                              The Reptile Room</p>
<p>                              The Wide Window</p>
<p>                              The Miserable Mill</p>
<p>                              The Austere Academy</p>
<p>                              The Ersatz Elevator</p>
<p>                              The Vile Village</p>
<p>                              The Hostile Hospital</p>
<p>                              The Carnivorous Carnival</p>
<p>                              The Slippery Slope</p>
<p>                              The Grim Grotto</p>
<p>                              The Penultimate Peril</p>
<p>                              The End</p>
<p>                              And what about All the Wrong Questions? In this four-book series a 13-year-old Lemony chronicles his dangerous and puzzling apprenticeship in a mysterious organisation that nobody knows anything about:</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;When Did you Last See Her?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Shouldn&#8217;t You Be in School?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              &#8216;Why is This Night Different from All Other Nights?&#8217;</p>
<p>                              Lemony Snicket was born before you were and is likely to die before you as well. He was born in a small town where the inhabitants were suspicious and prone to riot. He grew up near the sea and currently lives beneath it. Until recently, he was living somewhere else.</p>
<p>                              Brett Helquist was born in Ganado, Arizona, grew up in Orem, Utah, and now lives in New York City. He earned a bachelor&#8217;s degree in fine arts from Brigham Young University and has been illustrating ever since. His art has appeared in many publications, including Cricket magazine and The New York Times.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Inhibitors are back and Humanity is doomed!</p>
<p>                    Many, many millennia ago, the Inhibitors seeded the universe with machines designed to detect intelligent life &#8211; and then to suppress it. But after hundreds of millions of years, the machines started to fail and intelligent cultures started to emerge.</p>
<p>                    Then Dr Dan Sylveste and the crew of Infinity discovered what had happened to the long-vanished Amarantin race &#8230; and awakened the Inhibitors.</p>
<p>                    On Yellowstone, where no one is quite who they appear, the Inquisitor and the planet&#8217;s Most Wanted War Criminal are watching as the Inhibitors turn a small group of planets into raw materials. Whatever they are building with those materials is not going to be good for Humanity.</p>
<p>                    Once again, Al Reynolds has produced a stunning, universe-spanning space opera of mind-blowing proportions. Big in size, big in concepts, REDEMPTION ARK will leave you gasping at its audacity and breathless at its conclusion.</p>
<p>                    This is British SF at its absolute best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fans of Robert Jordan and George RR Martin alike have found a new champion of epic fantasy in Brandon Sanderson. And now, in the first of two sequels to The Alloy Of Law the Sunday Times and New York Times bestselling author returns to the world of Mistborn anda hunt for a mysterious assassin.     </p>
<p>                    The criminal elite of Elendel were invited to an auction &#8211; which became a massacre, when an unknown assailant slaughtered everyone in attendance. Now Wax and Wayne, both able to use magic, both lawmen from the rough and ungoverned frontier territories, are on the case. All the clues suggest the killer is a rogue kandra &#8211; a secretive, almost mythical, figure who acts from the shadows &#8211; called Bleeder . . . and that the governor is her next target. Bleeder, and the conspiracy behind the killings, has to be stopped . . . before the city is plunged into chaos.    </p>
<p>                    A brilliant adventure and a gripping story, Shadows of Self offers fans of The Alloy of Law everything they&#8217;ve been hoping for and, this being a Brandon Sanderson book, more, much more.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 Kindle Bestseller on Amazon.com     </p>
<p>                    Winner of Kindle Book Review&#8217;s Best Indie Book of 2012 Award     </p>
<p>                    Wool as you&#8217;ve never read it before: The New York Times bestselling novel now told in graphic novel format featuring full-color illustrations by Hugo Award-nominated artist Jimmy Broxton, and as adapted by fan-favorite writers Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray. This contemporary dystopian classic&#8211;hailed by Justin Cronin, New York Times bestselling author of The Passage, as &#8220;an epic feat of imagination&#8221;&#8211;will captivate readers both familiar and new.     </p>
<p>                    This is the story of mankind clawing for survival, of mankind on the edge. The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It began with Eragon . . . It ends with Inheritance.    </p>
<p>                    Not so very long ago, Eragon &#8211; Shadeslayer, Dragon Rider &#8211; was nothing more than a poor farm boy, and his dragon, Saphira, only a blue stone in the forest. Now, the fate of an entire civilization rests on their shoulders.    </p>
<p>                    Long months of training and battle have brought victories and hope, but they have also brought heartbreaking loss. And still the real battle lies ahead: they must confront Galbatorix. When they do, they will have to be strong enough to defeat him. And if they cannot, no one can. There will be no second chances.     </p>
<p>                    The Rider and his dragon have come farther than anyone dared to hope. But can they topple the evil king and restore justice to Alagaesia? And if so, at what cost?    </p>
<p>                    Featuring spectacular artwork by cult artist John Jude Palencar, this stunning book brings the bestselling Inheritance cycle to a breathtaking conclusion.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Life preservers are mandatory for this wet, wild, and wondrous adventure, the third entry in Rick Riordan&#8217;s New York Times #1 best-selling Norse mythology trilogy, which features a cameo from Percy Jackson.<br />
                    Magnus Chase, a once-homeless teen, is a resident of the Hotel Valhalla and one of Odin&#8217;s chosen warriors. As the son of Frey, the god of summer, fertility, and health, Magnus isn&#8217;t naturally inclined to fighting. But he has strong and steadfast friends, including Hearthstone the elf, Blitzen the dwarf, and Samirah the Valkyrie, and together they have achieved brave deeds, such as defeating Fenris Wolf and battling giants for Thor&#8217;s hammer, Mjolnir. Now Magnus faces his most dangerous trial yet. His cousin, Annabeth, recruits her boyfriend, Percy Jackson, to give Magnus some pointers, but will his training be enough?<br />
                    Loki is free from his chains. He&#8217;s readying Naglfar, the Ship of the Dead, complete with a host of giants and zombies, to sail against the Asgardian gods and begin the final battle of Ragnarok. It&#8217;s up to Magnus and his friends to stop him, but to do so they will have to sail across the oceans of Midgard, Jotunheim, and Niflheim in a desperate race to reach Naglfar before it&#8217;s ready to sail.<br />
                    Along the way, they will face angry sea gods, hostile giants, and an evil fire-breathing dragon. Magnus&#8217;s biggest challenge will be facing his own inner demons. Does he have what it takes to outwit the wily trickster god?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In response to an awful camp orientation video created by the god Apollo, Percy Jackson and other residents of Camp Half-Blood answer such questions as What is this place? and Do I get to keep the T-shirt? Newbies can check out the section on the Divine Cabins, read up on Magical Landmarks, and consult the chapter of Training Arenas.<br />
                    But Camp Half-Blood Confidential explores much more than just the buildings and grounds. It includes info that can only be learned from those who live there. For instance, campers do not always co-exist in peace and harmony. The camp is not run with superior efficiency. Prophecies do not flow forth with great regularity.<br />
                    Sprinkled throughout are stories from heroes who have called Camp Half-Blood home or just passed through on their way to places unknown. Chiron himself introduces the book with a brief history of training based on his millennia of experience. And, of course, there are divine words of wisdom from the god Apollo himself, because . . . well, because the demigod authors would prefer not to be struck down, thank you very much.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The unpredictable events of a particular Tuesday unroll before the reader with the precision and clarity of a silent movie.   A Caldecott Medal book.  AUTHOR: David Wiesner is one of the best-loved and most highly acclaimed picture book creators in the world. His books have been translated into more than a dozen languages and have won numerous awards in the United States and abroad. Three of the picture books he both wrote and illustrated became instant classics when they won the prestigious Caldecott Medal: Tuesday in 1992, The Three Pigs in 2002, and Flotsam in 2007, making him only the second person in the award&#8217;s long history to have won three times. He has also received two Caldecott Honors, for Free Fall and Sector 7.  REVIEWS: &#8220;Kids will love its lighthearted, meticulously imagined, fun-without-a-moral fantasy. Tuesday is bound to take off.&#8221; School Library Journal, Starred    </p>

But when a devious hot-shot wizard named Simon Lovelace ruthlessly humiliates Nathaniel in front of his elders, Nathaniel decides to kick up his education a few notches and show Lovelace who&#8217;s boss. With revenge on his mind, he summons the powerful djinni, Bartimaeus. But summoning Bartimaeus and controlling him are two different things entirely, and when Nathaniel sends the djinni out to steal Lovelace&#8217;s greatest treasure, the Amulet of Samarkand, he finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of magical espionage, murder, and rebellion.    </p>

<p>                     Jason Chaser&#8217;s survival of the horrific &#8212; and suspicious &#8212; crash in the Italian Run was nothing short of a miracle, but it&#8217;s going to take more miracles to salvage his budding racing career. Only the top four students at the International Race School will qualify to compete in the New York Masters, the most prestigious race on the pro circuit, and the accident has cost Jason more than precious points in the standings.     </p>
<p>                     It&#8217;s also undermined his confidence, and Jason&#8217;s rivals are more than willing to take advantage of his weakness to knock him out of the running. Jason will have to outthink as well as outrace the competition to get to New York &#8212; and the toughest race of his life.    </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    I look like a normal kid. Only there&#8217;s a difference. Poseidon, God of the Sea is my dad. Which sounds cool, but actually means there is usually someone (or something), somewhere, trying to kill me. </p>
<p>                    Now I live at Camp Half-Blood, with other kids like me. But Camp Half-Blood is a bit different to most summer camps. Instead of toasting marshmallows and singing campfire songs, we battle giant cannibals at dodgeball. </p>
<p>                    This time, we&#8217;re under attack, and I need to get my hands on the Golden Fleece or we&#8217;ll be invaded by monsters. Big ones. </p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />
                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is the stuff of legends&#8217; &#8211; The Guardian</p>

The one who showed her the truth of her past and &#8230; hopefully her future.Now it&#8217;s just time for them to live happily ever after. Only the gods have different plans. And with Atlantis rising, Maddi isn&#8217;t sure she&#8217;ll survive long enough to even finish her second year, let alone have any sort of future. Even worse, the sadistic Atlantean gods want to break her before they kill her. But Maddi has been underestimated before, and she has hidden strengths they&#8217;ll never see coming. Year of purple &#8230; bring it on. This is book two in the Supernatural Academy series. Full length at 105k words.    </p>

<p>                    Half boy. Half God. ALL Hero. </p>
<p>                    Being the son of a Greek God, nothing in my life has been straightforward. Or monster-free. </p>
<p>                    And it looks like that&#8217;s not going to change anytime soon now that my arch enemy Luke wants to invade Camp Half-Blood via an ancient labyrinth.</p>
<p>                    If he succeeds, thousands of bloodthirsty monsters will attack. So it&#8217;s goodbye sunshine, hello darkness as four of us descend into the terrifying underground and beyond . . .</p>
<p>                    WHAT TO EXPECT FROM PERCY JACKSON:<br />
                    *         Monsters<br />
                    *         Greek Gods<br />
                    *         Laughs (and terrified screams) </p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 60 million copies of his books worldwide. </p>
<p>                    &#8216;This is the stuff of legends&#8217; &#8211; The Guardian</p>

But that fragile truce will be tested as darkness gathers on the horizon. The vicious armies of the Tibran Empire have crossed the far seas and are threatening to destroy Maldobar completely.

And after an attempt to awaken Jaevid from his divine sleep fails, the fate of Maldobar is looking grim.Reigh has never known what it means to be a normal human. Raised amongst the gray elves in the wild jungle of Luntharda, he&#8217;s tried everything to fit in. But the dark power within him is bursting at the seams-refusing to be silenced. And while his adoptive father, Kiran, insists this power must be kept secret, Reigh knows he&#8217;s running out of time.As Maldobar burns, the world is desperate for a new hero. Destiny has called, and one boy will rise to answer.    </p>

<p>                    The battle for Camp Jupiter is over. New Rome is safe. Tarquin and his army of the undead have been defeated. Somehow Apollo has made it out alive, with a little bit of help from the Hunters of Artemis.    </p>

<p>                    Now Apollo and Meg must get ready for the final &#8211; and, let&#8217;s face it, probably fatal &#8211; adventure. They must face the last emperor, the terrifying Nero, and destroy him once and for all.    </p>
<p>                    Can Apollo find his godly form again? Will Meg be able to face up to her troubled past? Destiny awaits . . .    </p>

He knows no spells, has never helped to hatch a dragon, and has never worn a cloak of invisibility.All he knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley &#8211; a great big swollen spoiled bully. Harry&#8217;s room is a tiny closet at the foot of the stairs, and he hasn&#8217;t had a birthday party in eleven years.But all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to an incredible place that Harry &#8211; and anyone who reads about him &#8211; will find unforgettable.For it&#8217;s there that he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic in everything from classes to meals, but a great destiny that&#8217;s been waiting for him&#8230; if Harry can survive the encounter.</p>

Al número dos en Inglaterra. Al número tres en Kenia. A mí me atraparon en Nueva York, pero escapé. Soy el número seis. Ellos quieren acabar lo que empezaron.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Red Pyramid: the first book in Rick Riordan&#8217;s The Kane Chronicles.</p>
<p>                    Percy Jackson fought Greek Gods. Now the Gods of Egypt are waking in the modern world&#8230;</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I GUESS IT STARTED THE NIGHT OUR DAD BLEW UP THE BRITISH MUSEUM . . .&#8217;</p>
<p>                    CARTER AND SADIE KANE&#8217;S dad is a brilliant Egyptologist with a secret plan that goes horribly wrong. An explosion shatters the ancient Rosetta stone and unleashes Set, the evil god of chaos . . .</p>
<p>                    Set imprisons Dr Kane in a golden coffin and Carter and Sadie must run for their lives. To save their dad, they embark on a terrifying quest from Cairo to Paris to the American South-west and discover the truth about their family&#8217;s connection to the House of Life: an Egyptian temple of magic that has existed for thousands of years.</p>
<p>                    The pharaohs of ancient Egypt are far from dead and buried. And neither, unfortunately, are their gods . . .</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan has now sold an incredible 55 million copies of his books worldwide</p>
<p>                    Praise for the Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Witty and inspired. Gripping, touching and deliciously satirical&#8230;This is most likely to succeed Rowling. Puffin is on to a winner&#8217; &#8211; Amanda Craig, The Times</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Puns, jokes and subtle wit, alongside a gripping storyline&#8217; &#8211; Telegraph</p>
<p>                    &#8216;Perfectly paced, with electrifying moments chasing each other like heartbeats&#8217; &#8211; New York Times</p>
<p>                    Rick Riordan is an award-winning mystery writer. He lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was the overall winner of the Red House Children&#8217;s Book Award in 2006.</p>
<p>                    The Percy Jackson series:</p>
<p>                    The Lightning Thief; The Sea of Monsters; The Battle of the Labyrinth; The Titan&#8217;s Curse; The Last Olympian </p>
<p>                    Heroes of Olympus:</p>

<p>                    One day, he&#8217;s tracked down by an uncle he barely knows&#8211;a man his mother claimed was dangerous. Uncle Randolph tells him an impossible secret: Magnus is the son of a Norse god.     </p>
<p>                    The Viking myths are true. The gods of Asgard are preparing for war. Trolls, giants and worse monsters are stirring for doomsday. To prevent Ragnarok, Magnus must search the Nine Worlds for a weapon that has been lost for thousands of years.     </p>
<p>                    When an attack by fire giants forces him to choose between his own safety and the lives of hundreds of innocents, Magnus makes a fatal decision.     </p>
<p>                    Sometimes, the only way to start a new life is to die . . .    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dematr is a world ruled by the diametrically opposed Mage and Mechanic Guilds. For centuries, the two Great Guilds have been bitter rivals. But now a Storm approaches, one that could sweep away everything that humans have built. Only one person has any chance of uniting enough of the world behind to stop the Storm. Mari is a brilliant young Mechanic, just out of the Guild Halls, where she has spent most of her life learning how to run the steam locomotives and other devices of her Guild. Alain is the youngest Mage ever to learn how to change the world he sees with the power of his mind. Each has been taught that the works of the other&#8217;s Guild are frauds. But when their caravan is destroyed, they must join forces. Their union could save the world from the approaching Storm, but it could also upend the Great Guilds who will stop at nothing to preserve their power. Mari and Alain will have to choose between protecting their lives and their Guilds, or risking everything to protect Dematr from the coming Storm.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Books 1-8 of the New York Times bestselling Magic Tree House series plus an interview with Mary Pope Osborne!</p>
<p>                    Meet Jack and Annie!</p>
<p>                    Jack and his younger sister, Annie, are just regular kids. But when they discover a tree house in the woods, something magical happens. In books 1-4, Jack and Annie are whisked back in time to the Age of Dinosaurs, a medieval castle, ancient pyramids, and treasure-seeking pirates. In books 5-8, Jack and Annie&#8217;s friend, Morgan le Fay, is in trouble! They must find four M things to free her from a spell. Their adventures take them to meet a ninja master in ancient Japan, flee a crocodile on the Amazon River, discover the cave people of the Ice Age, and blast off to the moon in the future. It&#8217;s a difficult and dangerous mission, but Jack and Annie will do anything to save a friend! </p>
<p>                    Audiobooks in this set include: Dinosaurs Before Dark (#1), The Knight at Dawn (#2), Mummies in the Morning (#3), Pirates Past Noon (#4), Night of the Ninjas (#5), Afternoon on the Amazon (#6), Sunset of the Sabertooth (#7), and Midnight on the Moon (#8). </p>
<p>                    Mary Pope Osborne brings together just the right combination of history, magic, and fast-paced adventure to satisfy kids, parents, teachers, and librarians all over the world with her New York Times bestselling series. </p>
<p>                    Osborne&#8217;s narration is low-key and well-paced. A great way to introduce children who are reluctant readers or can&#8217;t yet read to this highly entertaining book series and to reading in general.&#8211;Chicago Parent</p>
<p>                     &#8220;Osborne&#8217;s soothing, beautifully articulated voice and knack for characterization are reliably pleasing.&#8211;AudioFile</p>

Brimming with rich detail and humour that perfectly complements J.K. Rowling&#8217;s timeless classic, Jim Kay&#8217;s glorious illustrations will captivate fans and new readers alike.     </p>
<p>                    When a letter arrives for unhappy but ordinary Harry Potter, a decade-old secret is revealed to him that apparently he&#8217;s the last to know. His parents were wizards, killed by a Dark Lord&#8217;s curse when Harry was just a baby, and which he somehow survived. Leaving his unsympathetic aunt and uncle for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry stumbles upon a sinister mystery when he finds a three-headed dog guarding a room on the third floor. Then he hears of a missing stone with astonishing powers, which could be valuable, dangerous &#8211; or both. An incredible adventure is about to begin!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes someone creative? How does someone face the empty page, the empty stage and making something where nothing existed before? Not just a dilemma for the artist, it is something everyone faces everyday. What will I cook that isn&#8217;t boring? How can I make that memo persuasive? What sales pitch will increase the order, get me the job, lock in that bonus? These too, are creative acts, and they all share a common need: proper preparation. For Twyla Tharp, creativity is no mystery; it&#8217;s the product of hard work and preparation, of knowing one&#8217;s aims and one&#8217;s subject, of learning from approaches taken in the past. It&#8217;s a process undertaken every day. It&#8217;s a habit. The Creative Habit is not merely a look inside the mind of a remarkable woman with remarkable skills, but a programmatic, inspiring, encouraging guide to help each of us achieve our fullest creative potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 New York Times, USA Today, and internationally bestselling author Jennifer L. Armentrout returns to the world of the Lux with The Burning Shadow, the steamy, shocking second installment of the Origin series that will leave readers reeling.</p>
<p>When Evelyn Dasher crossed paths with Luc, she was thrown headfirst into the world of the Lux&#8211;only to discover that she was already far more involved in their world than she ever suspected.</p>
<p>Because the Luxen aren&#8217;t the only ones with a hidden past. There&#8217;s a gap in Evie&#8217;s memory, lost months of her life and a lingering sense that something happened, something she can&#8217;t remember and nobody is willing to tell her. She needs to find out the truth about who she is&#8211;and who she was. But every answer she finds only brings up more questions.</p>
<p>Her search for the truth brings her ever closer to Luc, the Origin at the center of it all. He&#8217;s powerful, arrogant, inhumanly beautiful, extremely dangerous&#8230;and possibly in love with her. But even as Evie falls for him, she can&#8217;t help but wonder if his attraction is to her, or to the memory of a girl who no longer exists.</p>
<p>And all the while, a new threat looms: reports of a flu-like, fatal virus that the government insists is being spread by Luxen. A horrifying illness that changes whoever it touches, spreading panic across a country already at its breaking point.</p>
