										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the World&#8217;s all-time great leaders&#8217;Professor Anita Elberse, Harvard Business SchoolWhat does it take to lead a team to world-class success over a sustained period of time?Sir  Alex Ferguson is one of the few leaders who truly knows. In his 38  years in management, Sir Alex won an astonishing 49 trophies and helped  grow Manchester United into one of the biggest commercial brands in the  world.  In this inspirational and straight-talking book, Sir Alex reveals the secrets behind his record-breaking career.LEADING  is structured around the key skills that Sir Alex values most highly.  It includes subjects we immediately associate with his managerial style:  Discipline, Control, Teamwork and Motivation. But it also addresses  subjects that are less obvious but no less important when seeking  success: Delegation, Data Analysis and Dealing with Failure.Written  with the investor Sir Michael Moritz, a longstanding friend of Sir  Alex, LEADING is packed with insight, wisdom, humour and honesty. The  individual stories inevitably concern themselves with football, and the  phenomenal success that came along the way, but the lessons can be  applied by anyone.<br />
                    Whether you run a business, teach in a classroom, or  work in a small team, LEADING will help you become a better leader.</p>

<p>                              This is the revised and expanded 5th edition of the international bestseller about why Spain, Germany and Brazil win, and why the USA, Japan, Australia &#8211; and even Iraq &#8211; are destined to become the kings of the world&#8217;s most popular sport.    </p>
<p>                              Football truly is the world&#8217;s favourite game, followed in over 200 countries by hundreds of millions of people pouring their hearts and souls into supporting their chosen team every week.    </p>
<p>                              But behind the passion are questions that all true football aficionados want to know: why do England lose whilst German and Brazil win? How have Spain conquered the world? Why do so many clubs buy the wrong players?    </p>
<p>                              Fully revised and updated, Soccernomics is the revolutionary guide from an economist and a sports writer who answer all these questions and more.</p>
