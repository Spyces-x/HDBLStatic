										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the moment radiation was discovered in the late nineteenth century, nuclear science has had a rich history of innovative scientific exploration and discovery, coupled with mistakes, accidents, and downright disasters.    </p>
<p>                     Mahaffey, a long-time advocate of continued nuclear research and nuclear energy, looks at each incident in turn and analyzes what happened and why, often discovering where scientists went wrong when analyzing past meltdowns.    </p>
<p>                     Every incident has lead to new facets in understanding about the mighty atom-and Mahaffey puts forth what the future should be for this final frontier of science that still holds so much promise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*WINNER OF THE BAILLIE GIFFORD PRIZE FOR NON-FICTION 2018*<br />
                    *WINNER OF THE PUSHKIN HOUSE BOOK PRIZE 2019*    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;As moving as it is painstakingly researched. . . a cracking read&#8217; Viv Groskop, Observer    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A riveting account of human error and state duplicity. . . rightly being hailed as a classic&#8217; Hannah Betts, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    On 26 April 1986 at 1.23am a reactor at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power  Plant in Soviet Ukraine exploded. While the authorities scrambled to  understand what was occurring, workers, engineers, firefighters and  those living in the area were abandoned to their fate. The blast put the  world on the brink of nuclear annihilation, contaminating over half of  Europe with radioactive fallout.    </p>
<p>                    In Chernobyl, award-winning  historian Serhii Plokhy draws on recently opened archives to recreate  these events in all their drama. A moment by moment account of the heroes, perpetrators and victims of a tragedy, Chernobyl is the first full account of a gripping, unforgettable Cold War story.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A compelling history of the 1986 disaster and its aftermath . . .  plunges the reader into the sweaty, nervous tension of the Chernobyl  control room on that fateful night when human frailty and design flaws  combined to such devastating effect&#8217; Daniel Beer, Guardian    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Haunting &#8230; near-Tolstoyan. His voice is humane and inflected with nostalgia&#8217; Roland Elliott Brown, Spectator     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Extraordinary,  vividly written, powerful storytelling &#8230; the first full-scale history  of the world&#8217;s worst nuclear disaster, one of the defining moments in  the Cold War, told minute by minute&#8217; Victor Sebestyen Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Plays out like a classical tragedy &#8230; fascinating&#8217; Julian Evans, Daily Telegraph    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Here at last is the monumental history the disaster deserves&#8217; Julie McDowall, The Times</p>
