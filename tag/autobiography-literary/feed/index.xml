										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The New York Times bestselling memoir about identity, love and understanding. Now a major motion picture starring Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, and Lucas Hedges, directed by Joel Edgerton. &#8220;Every sentence of the story will stir your soul&#8221; (O Magazine).    </p>
<p>                    The son of a Baptist pastor and deeply embedded in church life in small town Arkansas, as a young man Garrard Conley was terrified and conflicted about his sexuality. When Garrard was a nineteen-year-old college student, he was outed to his parents, and was forced to make a life-changing decision: either agree to attend a church-supported conversion therapy program that promised to cure him of homosexuality; or risk losing family, friends, and the God he had prayed to every day of his life. Through an institutionalized Twelve-Step Program heavy on Bible study, he was supposed to emerge heterosexual, ex-gay, cleansed of impure urges and stronger in his faith in God for his brush with sin. Instead, even when faced with a harrowing and brutal journey, Garrard found the strength and understanding to break out in search of his true self and forgiveness.     </p>
<p>                    By confronting his buried past and the burden of a life lived in shadow, Garrard traces the complex relationships among family, faith, and community. At times heart-breaking, at times triumphant, Boy Erased is a testament to love that survives despite all odds.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Twentieth Anniversary Edition with Contributions from Joe Hill and Owen King </p>
<p>                    Immensely helpful and illuminating to any aspiring writer, this special edition of Stephen King&#8217;s critically lauded, million-copy bestseller shares the experiences, habits, and convictions that have shaped him and his work.</p>
<p>                     Part memoir, part masterclass by one of the bestselling authors of all time, this superb volume is a revealing and practical view of the writer&#8217;s craft, comprising the basic tools of the trade every writer must have. </p>
<p>                    King&#8217;s advice is grounded in his vivid memories from childhood through his emergence as a writer, from his struggling early career to his widely reported, near-fatal accident in 1999 &#8211; and how the inextricable link between writing and living spurred his recovery. </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly structured, friendly and inspiring, On Writing will empower and entertain everyone who reads it &#8211; fans, writers, and anyone who loves a great story well told.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An intimate journey across America, as told by one of its most beloved writers    </p>
<p>                     To hear the speech of the real America, to smell the grass and the trees, to see the colors and the light-these were John Steinbeck&#8217;s goals as he set out, at the age of fifty-eight, to rediscover the country he had been writing about for so many years.    </p>
<p>                     With Charley, his French poodle, Steinbeck drives the interstates and the country roads, dines with truckers, encounters bears at Yellowstone and old friends in San Francisco. Along the way he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, the particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and  the unexpected kindness of strangers.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From one of America&#8217;s iconic writers, a portrait of a marriage and a life &#8211; in good times and bad &#8211; that will speak to anyone who has ever loved a husband or wife or child. A stunning book of electric honesty and passion.    </p>
<p>                              Several days before Christmas 2003, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion saw their only daughter, Quintana, fall ill. At first they thought it was flu, then pneumonia, then complete sceptic shock. She was put into an induced coma and placed on life support. Days later &#8211; the night before New Year&#8217;s Eve -the Dunnes were just sitting down to dinner after visiting the hospital when John suffered a massive and fatal coronary. In a second, this close, symbiotic partnership of 40 years was over. Four weeks later, their daughter pulled through. Two months after that, arriving at LA airport, she collapsed and underwent six hours of brain surgery at UCLA Medical Centre to relieve a massive hematoma.    </p>
<p>                              This powerful book is Didion&#8217;s &#8216;attempt to make sense of the weeks and then months that cut loose any fixed idea I ever had about death, about illness &#8230; about marriage and children and memory &#8230; about the shallowness of sanity, about life itself&#8217;. The result is an exploration of an intensely personal yet universal experience: a portrait of a marriage, and a life, in good times and bad.</p>
