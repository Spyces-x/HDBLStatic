<p>                    Do you regularly find yourself in long, unstructured meetings which end without a decision? Are you a team leader looking for tips on increasing productivity? Or are you looking for ways to enhance collaboration?    </p>
<p>                    Six Thinking Hats, Edward de Bono&#8217;s classic book on meetings, remains as relevant as ever. Used to huge success by big companies and organisations such as IBM, Siemens and NASA, the Six-Hats method is a proven way to:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Reduce meeting lengths to one quarter of what they were previously<br />
                    &#8211; Make decisions in just 15 minutes, rather than 3 hours<br />
                    &#8211; Increase productivity by nearly 500%    </p>
<p>                    This extremely simple tool not only increases efficiency in discussions and decision-making, but also encourages openness and trust among colleagues, resulting in happier team, a rise in productivity, and decisions which almost make themselves.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An inspiring man with brilliant ideas. De Bono never ceases to amaze&#8217; Sir Richard Branson</p>
