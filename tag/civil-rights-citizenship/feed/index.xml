<p>                    Discrimination and Disparities gathers a wide array of empirical evidence to challenge the idea that different economic outcomes can be explained by any one factor, be it discrimination, exploitation, or genetics. This revised and enlarged edition also analyzes the human consequences of the prevailing social vision of these disparities and the policies based on that vision&#8211;from educational disasters to widespread crime and violence.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Something is wrong. We all know it. American life expectancy is declining for a third straight year. Birth rates are dropping. Nearly half of us think the other political party isn&#8217;t just wrong; they&#8217;re evil. We&#8217;re the richest country in history, but we&#8217;ve never been more pessimistic. What&#8217;s causing the despair?    </p>
<p>                    In Them, bestselling author and U.S. senator Ben Sasse argues that our crisis isn&#8217;t really about politics. It&#8217;s that we&#8217;re so lonely we can&#8217;t see straight &#8211; and it bubbles out as anger. Local communities are collapsing. Across the nation, little leagues are disappearing, Rotary clubs are dwindling, and in all likelihood, we don&#8217;t know the neighbour two doors down. Work isn&#8217;t what we&#8217;d hoped: less certainty, few lifelong coworkers, shallow purpose. Stable families and enduring friendships &#8211; life&#8217;s fundamental pillars &#8211; are in statistical freefall.    </p>
<p>                    As traditional tribes of place evaporate, we rally against common enemies so we can feel part of a team. No institutions command widespread public trust, enabling foreign intelligence agencies to use technology to pick the scabs on our toxic divisions. We&#8217;re in danger of half of us believing different facts than the other half, and the digital revolution throws gas on the fire.    </p>
<p>                    There&#8217;s a path forward &#8211; but reversing our decline requires something radical: a rediscovery of real places and human-to-human relationships. Even as technology nudges us to become rootless, Sasse shows how only a recovery of rootedness can heal our lonely souls. America wants you to be happy, but more urgently, America needs you to love your neighbour and connect with your community. Fixing what&#8217;s wrong with the country depends on it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Praised by the late John Lewis, this is the seminal book about the long and ongoing struggle to win voting rights for all citizens by the president of The Brennan Center, the leading organization on voter rights and election security, now newly revised to describe today&#8217;s intense fights over voting.     </p>
<p>                    As Rep. Lewis said, and recent events in state legislatures across the country demonstrate, the struggle for the right to vote is not over. In this &#8220;important and powerful&#8221; (Linda Greenhouse, former New York Times Supreme Court correspondent) book Michael Waldman describes the long struggle to extend the right to vote to all Americans. From the writing of the Constitution, and at every step along the way, as disenfranchised Americans sought this right, others have fought to stop them. Waldman traces this history from the Founders&#8217; debates to today&#8217;s many restrictions: gerrymandering; voter ID laws; the flood of dark money released by conservative organizations; and the concerted effort in many state legislatures after the 2020 election to enact new limitations on voting.     </p>
<p>                    Despite the pandemic, the 2020 election had the highest turnout since 1900. In this updated edition, Waldman describes the nationwide effort that made this possible. He offers new insights into how Donald Trump&#8217;s false claims of fraud&#8211;&#8220;the Big Lie&#8221;&#8211;led to the January 6 insurrection and the fights over voting laws that followed one of the most dramatic chapters in the story of American democracy.     </p>
<p>                    As Waldman shows, this fight, sometimes vicious, has always been at the center of American politics because it determines the outcome of the struggle for power. The Fight to Vote is &#8220;an engaging, concise history&#8230;offering many useful reforms that advocates on both sides of the aisle should consider&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NUMBER ONE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT is an empowering letter from former White House Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri to the first woman president, and by extension, to all women working to succeed in any field.     </p>
<p>                    By using lessons learned during her experiences with Hillary Clinton, President Obama, and Elizabeth Edwards &#8211; to name a few &#8211; Palmieri through each chapter creates a forward-thinking framework of inspirational and practical advice for all women everywhere &#8211; from boardrooms to living rooms &#8211; who are determined to seize control of their lives, their workplaces, and their country. DEAR MADAM PRESIDENT will turn the results of the 2016 election into something incredibly empowering for future female leaders and independent thinkers everywhere.    </p>
<p>                    We haven&#8217;t wrapped our heads around what it should look like for a woman to be in the job of President. Our only models are men. This of course was seen during the Hillary Clinton campaign, and no one knows this better than Jennifer Palmieri. While wildly disappointed by the outcome of the election, Palmieri optimistically argues in the book that the Clinton candidacy and all she experienced on the campaign trail &#8211; confusion, admiration, hate, love, acceptance, rejection &#8211; can now open the country up to reimagining women in leadership roles. And that is what Palmieri takes on in this book &#8211; redefining expectations for women looking to lead and creating a blueprint for women candidates and leaders to follow.</p>

<p>                    WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY ZOE WILLIAMS     </p>
<p>                    The term feminism did not yet exist when Mary Wollstonecraft wrote this book, but it was the first great piece of feminist writing. In these pages you will find the essence of her argument &#8211; for the education of women and for an increased female contribution to society. Her work made the first ripples of what would later become the tidal wave of the women&#8217;s rights movement. Rationalist but revolutionary, Wollstonecraft changed the world for women.    </p>

<p>                    LONGLISTED FOR THE 2020 ANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE     </p>
<p>                    A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER     </p>
<p>                    Named a best book of 2019 by The New York Times, TIME, The Washington Post,  NPR, Hudson Booksellers, The New York Public Library, The Dallas Morning News, and Library Journal.     </p>
<p>                    Chapter after chapter, it&#8217;s like one shattered myth after another. &#8211; NPR     </p>
<p>                    An informed, moving and kaleidoscopic portrait&#8230; Treuer&#8217;s powerful book suggests the need for soul-searching about the meanings of American history and the stories we tell ourselves about this nation&#8217;s past.. &#8211; New York Times Book Review, front page     </p>
<p>                    A sweeping history&#8211;and counter-narrative&#8211;of Native American life from the Wounded Knee massacre to the present.     </p>
<p>                    The received idea of Native American history&#8211;as promulgated by books like Dee Brown&#8217;s mega-bestselling 1970 Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&#8211;has been that American Indian history essentially ended with the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee. Not only did one hundred fifty Sioux die at the hands of the U. S. Cavalry, the sense was, but Native civilization did as well.     </p>
<p>                    Growing up Ojibwe on a reservation in Minnesota, training as an anthropologist, and researching Native life past and present for his nonfiction and novels, David Treuer has uncovered a different narrative. Because they did not disappear&#8211;and not despite but rather because of their intense struggles to preserve their language, their traditions, their families, and their very existence&#8211;the story of American Indians since the end of the nineteenth century to the present is one of unprecedented resourcefulness and reinvention.     </p>
<p>                    In The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee, Treuer melds history with reportage and memoir. Tracing the tribes&#8217; distinctive cultures from first contact, he explores how the depredations of each era spawned new modes of survival. The devastating seizures of land gave rise to increasingly sophisticated legal and political maneuvering that put the lie to the myth that Indians don&#8217;t know or care about property. The forced assimilation of their children at government-run boarding schools incubated a unifying Native identity. Conscription in the US military and the pull of urban life brought Indians into the mainstream and modern times, even as it steered the emerging shape of self-rule and spawned a new generation of resistance. The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is the essential, intimate story of a resilient people in a transformative era.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An indispensable resource for  white people who want to challenge white supremacy but don&#8217;t know where  to begin&#8217; Robin DiAngelo, author of New York Times bestseller WHITE FRAGILITY    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It should be mandatory reading &#8230; Buy the book, do the work and then push more copies into the hands of everyone you know&#8217; Emma Gannon    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Confrontational and much-needed&#8217; Stylist    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;She is no-joke changing the world and, for what it&#8217;s worth, the way I live my life.&#8217;<br />
                    Anne Hathaway    </p>
<p>                    ___________    </p>
<p>                    Me and White Supremacy shows readers how to dismantle the privilege within themselves so that they can stop (often unconsciously) inflicting damage on people of colour, and in turn, help other white people do better, too.    </p>
<p>                    When Layla Saad began an Instagram challenge called #MeAndWhiteSupremacy, she never predicted it would spread as widely as it did. She encouraged people to own up and share their racist behaviours, big and small. She was looking for truth, and she got it. Thousands of people participated, and over 90,000 people downloaded the book.    </p>
<p>                    The updated and expanded Me and White Supremacy takes the work deeper by adding more historical and cultural contexts, sharing moving stories and anecdotes, and including expanded definitions, examples, and further resources.    </p>
<p>                    Awareness leads to action, and action leads to change. The numbers show that readers are ready to do this work &#8211; let&#8217;s give it to them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winner of the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction    </p>
<p>                    Longlisted for the National Book Award    </p>
<p>                    One of the New York Times Book Review&#8217;s 10 Best Books of 2017    </p>
<p>                    Former public defender James Forman, Jr. is a leading critic of mass incarceration and its disproportionate impact on people of colour. In LOCKING UP OWN OWN, he seeks to understand the war on crime that began in the 1970s and why it was supported by many African American leaders in the nation&#8217;s urban centres.    </p>
<p>                    Forman shows us that the first substantial cohort of black mayors, judges and police chiefs took office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction. Many prominent black officials, including Washington, DC mayor Marion Barry and federal prosecutor Eric Holder, feared that the gains of the civil rights movement were being undermined by lawlessness &#8211; and thus embraced tough-on-crime measures, including longer sentences and aggressive police tactics. In the face of skyrocketing murder rates and the proliferation of open-air drug markets, they believed they had no choice. But the policies they adopted would have devastating consequences for residents of poor black neighbourhoods.    </p>
<p>                    A former public defender, Forman tells riveting stories of politicians, community activists, police officers, defendants and crime victims. He writes with compassion about individuals trapped in terrible dilemmas &#8211; from the men and women he represented in court to officials struggling to respond to a public safety emergency.LOCKING UP OWN OWN enriches our understanding of why American society became so punitive and offers important lessons to anyone concerned about the future of race and the criminal justice system.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Robert B. Reich makes a powerful case for the expansion of America&#8217;s moral imagination. Rooting his argument in common sense and everyday reality, he demonstrates that a common good constitutes the very essence of any society or nation. Societies, he says, undergo virtuous cycles that reinforce the common good as well as vicious cycles that undermine it, one of which America has been experiencing for the past five decades. This process can and must be reversed. But first we need to weigh the moral obligations of citizenship and carefully consider how we relate to honor, shame, patriotism, truth, and the meaning of leadership.     </p>
<p>                     Powerful, urgent, and utterly vital, this is a heartfelt missive from one of our foremost political thinkers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; Pulitzer Prize-winning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear.    </p>
<p>                    ONE OF OPRAH&#8217;S &#8220;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8221; &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR &#8211; The Christian Science Monitor &#8211; Southern Living     </p>
<p>                     Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the &#8220;better angels of our nature&#8221; have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women&#8217;s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear&#8211;a struggle that continues even now.     </p>
<p>                    While the American story has not always&#8211;or even often&#8211;been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us, &#8220;The good news is that we have come through such darkness before&#8221;&#8211;as, time and again, Lincoln&#8217;s better angels have found a way to prevail.    </p>
<p>                    Praise for The Soul of America     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.&#8221;&#8211;Walter Isaacson     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Gripping and inspiring, The Soul of America is Jon Meacham&#8217;s declaration of his faith in America.&#8221;&#8211;Newsday    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Meacham gives readers a long-term perspective on American history and a reason to believe the soul of America is ultimately one of kindness and caring, not rancor and paranoia.&#8221;&#8211;USA Today</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The iconic New York Times bestseller that &#8216;struck the spark that would eventually light the fire of Black Lives Matter&#8217; (Ibram X. Kendi)    </p>
<p>                    Named one of the most important nonfiction books of the 21st century by Entertainment Weekly&#8217; Slate&#8217; Chronicle of Higher Education&#8217; Literary Hub and Book Riot    </p>
<p>                    Once in a great while a book comes along that radically changes our understanding of a crucial political issue and helps to fuel a social movement. The New Jim Crow is such a book. Lawyer and activist Michelle Alexander offers a stunning account of the rebirth of a caste-like system in the United States, one that has resulted in   millions of African Americans locked behind bars and then relegated to a permanent second-class status, denied the very rights supposedly won in  the Civil Rights movement.      </p>
<p>                    Challenging the notion that the election of Barack Obama signalled a new era of colourblindness in the United States, The New Jim Crow reveals how racial discrimination was not ended but merely redesigned. By   targeting black men through the War on Drugs and decimating communities of colour, the American criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, relegating millions to a permanent second-class status even as it formally adheres to the principle of colourblindness.     </p>
<p>                    A searing call to action for everyone concerned with social justice, The New Jim Crow is one of the most important books about race in the 21st century.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The uncompromising Nick Cohen exposes the reality behind the freedoms we enjoy in the book that won Polemic of the Year at the 2013 Political Book Awards.    </p>
<p>                              After the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of Communism, and the advent of the Web which allowed for even the smallest voice to be heard, everywhere you turned you were told that we were living in an age of unparalleled freedom.    </p>
<p>                              &#8216;You Can&#8217;t Read This Book&#8217; argues that this view is dangerously naive. From the revolution in Iran that wasn&#8217;t, to the Great Firewall of China and the imposition of super-injunctions from the filthy rich protecting their privacy, the traditional opponents of freedom of speech &#8211; religious fanaticism, plutocratic power and dictatorial states &#8211; are thriving and in many respects finding the world a more comfortable place in the early 21st century than they did in the late 20th.</p>
