										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hands-on user&#8217;s guide to the groundbreaking Wheel of Awareness meditation practice featured in the New York Times bestseller Aware takes readers step-by-step through a twenty-one-day journey to discover what it means to be truly present and aware in our daily lives.     </p>
<p>                    In today&#8217;s increasingly fast-paced world it can be difficult to find moments to catch your breath, regain inner balance, and just . . . be. This simple yet profound guide shows readers how to strengthen their minds by learning to focus attention, open awareness, and develop a positive state of mind&#8211;the three pillars of mindfulness practice that research shows lead to greater physical and mental well-being.     </p>
<p>                    Psychiatrist and cofounder of the Mindsight Institute, Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., created the science-grounded meditation practice called the Wheel of Awareness to unlock the power of the brain to integrate its many functions and develop internal resources that lead to an enduring sense of calm and quiet. Packed with guided meditation instructions, practical exercises, and everyday tools and techniques, Becoming Aware meets readers where they are and offers a simple program to enhance our inner sense of clarity and even our interpersonal well-being.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our subjective inner life is what really matters to us as human beings&#8211;and yet we know relatively little about how it arises. Over a long and distinguished career Benjamin Libet has conducted experiments that have helped us see, in clear and concrete ways, how the brain produces conscious awareness. For the first time, Libet gives his own account of these experiments and their importance for our understanding of consciousness.</p>
<p>                    Most notably, Libet&#8217;s experiments reveal a substantial delay&#8211;the &#8220;mind time&#8221; of the title&#8211;before any awareness affects how we view our mental activities. If all conscious awarenesses are preceded by unconscious processes, as Libet observes, we are forced to conclude that unconscious processes initiate our conscious experiences. Freely voluntary acts are found to be initiated unconsciously before an awareness of wanting to act&#8211;a discovery with profound ramifications for our understanding of free will.</p>
<p>                    How do the physical activities of billions of cerebral nerve cells give rise to an integrated conscious subjective awareness? How can the subjective mind affect or control voluntary actions? Libet considers these questions, as well as the implications of his discoveries for the nature of the soul, the identity of the person, and the relation of the non-physical subjective mind to the physical brain that produces it. Rendered in clear, accessible language, Libet&#8217;s experiments and theories will allow interested amateurs and experts alike to share the experience of the extraordinary discoveries made in the practical study of consciousness.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better &#8211; and thus we don&#8217;t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is &#8220;the elephant in the brain.&#8221; Such<br />
                    an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly &#8211; to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once<br />
                    everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?</p>
<p>                    Our unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their &#8220;official&#8221; ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies<br />
                    designed to favor or discourage them. You won&#8217;t see yourself &#8211; or the world &#8211; the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD</p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.</p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.</p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.</p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy. </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Michio Kaku, the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible and Physics of the Future tackles the most fascinating and complex object in the known universe: the human brain.     </p>
<p>                    The Future of the Mind brings a topic that once belonged solely to the province of science fiction into a startling new reality. This scientific tour de force unveils the astonishing research being done in top laboratories around the world&#8211;all based on the latest advancements in neuroscience and physics&#8211;including recent experiments in telepathy, mind control, avatars, telekinesis, and recording memories and dreams. The Future of the Mind is an extraordinary, mind-boggling exploration of the frontiers of neuroscience. Dr. Kaku looks toward the day when we may achieve the ability to upload the human brain to a computer, neuron for neuron; project thoughts and emotions around the world on a brain-net; take a &#8220;smart pill&#8221; to enhance cognition; send our consciousness across the universe; and push the very limits of immortality.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and mindfulness practices, this guide offers breakthrough insights and simple techniques for developing deep-seated, long-lasting confidence     </p>
<p>                     Too many of us miss out on opportunities in life because we lack self-confidence. Whether it&#8217;s public speaking, taking on a leadership role, or asking someone for a date, there are situations in which we just don&#8217;t feel equipped to handle the challenges we face.     </p>
<p>                     Russ Harris offers a surprising solution to low self-confidence, shyness, and insecurity: Rather than trying to &#8220;get over&#8221; our fears, he says, the secret is to form a new and wiser relationship with them. Paradoxically, it&#8217;s only when we stop struggling against our fearfulness that we begin to find lasting freedom from it.     </p>
<p>                     Drawing on the techniques of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a cutting-edge form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, The Confidence Gap explains how to:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Free yourself from common misconceptions about what confidence is and how to build it<br />
                     &#8211; Transform your relationship with fear and anxiety<br />
                     &#8211; Clarify your core values and use them as your inspiration and motivation<br />
                     &#8211; Use mindfulness to effectively handle negative thoughts and feelings.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;This book could save you years of psychological struggle, yank you out of negative emotional patterns, and help propel you to a much happier, more productive life.&#8221; &#8211;Martha Beck, author and Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s life coach</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering neuroscientist argues that we are more than our brains    </p>
<p>                    To many, the brain is the seat of personal identity and autonomy. But the way we talk about the brain is often rooted more in mystical conceptions of the soul than in scientific fact. This blinds us to the physical realities of mental function. We ignore bodily influences on our psychology, from chemicals in the blood to bacteria in the gut, and overlook the ways that the environment affects our behavior, via factors varying from subconscious sights and sounds to the weather. As a result, we alternately overestimate our capacity for free will or equate brains to inorganic machines like computers. But a brain is neither a soul nor an electrical network: it is a bodily organ, and it cannot be separated from its surroundings. Our selves aren&#8217;t just inside our heads&#8211;they&#8217;re spread throughout our bodies and beyond. Only once we come to terms with this can we grasp the true nature of our humanity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavioral economist and New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our general behaviour, up close and personal.    </p>
<p>                              In The Upside of Irrationality, behavioral economist Dan Ariely will explore the many ways in which our behaviour often leads us astray in terms of our romantic relationships, our experiences in the workplace, and our temptations to cheat. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.    </p>
<p>                              Among the topics Dan explores are:<br />
                    * What we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy;<br />
                    * How we learn to love the ones we are with;<br />
                    * Why online dating doesn&#8217;t work, and how we can improve on it;<br />
                    * Why learning more about people make us like them less;<br />
                    * Why large bonuses can make CEOs less productive;<br />
                    * How to really motivate people at work;<br />
                    * Why bad directions can help us;<br />
                    * How we fall in love with our ideas;<br />
                    * How we are motivated by revenge; and<br />
                    * What motivates us to cheat.    </p>
<p>                              Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational such a hit, Dan will emphasize the important role that irrationality plays in our day-to-day decisionmaking-not just in our financial marketplace, but in the most hidden aspects of our lives.</p>

                              &#8216;Brilliant&#8217; Guardian<br />
                              &#8216;Fascinating and often delightful&#8217; The Times    </p>
<p>                                What if intelligent life on Earth evolved not once, but twice? The octopus is the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien. What can we learn from the encounter?    </p>
<p>                              In Other Minds, Peter Godfrey-Smith, a distinguished philosopher of science and a skilled scuba diver, tells a bold new story of how nature became aware of itself &#8211; a story that largely occurs in the ocean, where animals first appeared.    </p>
<p>                              Tracking the mind&#8217;s fitful development from unruly clumps of seaborne cells to the first evolved nervous systems in ancient relatives of jellyfish, he explores the incredible evolutionary journey of the cephalopods, which began as inconspicuous molluscs who would later abandon their shells to rise above the ocean floor, searching for prey and acquiring the greater intelligence needed to do so &#8211; a journey completely independent from the route that mammals and birds would later take.    </p>
<p>                              But what kind of intelligence do cephalopods possess? How did the octopus, a solitary creature with little social life, become so smart? What is it like to have eight tentacles that are so packed with neurons that they virtually &#8216;think for themselves&#8217;? By tracing the question of inner life back to its roots and comparing human beings with our most remarkable animal relatives, Godfrey-Smith casts crucial new light on the octopus mind &#8211; and on our own.</p>

<p>                    &#8211; Is there a memory that torments you, or an irrational fear you can&#8217;t shake?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you sometimes become unreasonably angry or upset and find it hard to calm down?<br />
                    &#8211; Do you ever wonder why you can&#8217;t stop behaving the way you do, no matter how hard you try?<br />
                    &#8211; Are you and your child (or parent, partner, or boss) locked in a seemingly inevitable pattern of conflict?     </p>
<p>                    What if you could escape traps like these and live a fuller, richer, happier life? This isn&#8217;t mere speculation but the result of twenty-five years of careful hands-on clinical work by Daniel J. Siegel, M.D. A Harvard-trained physician, Dr. Siegel is one of the revolutionary global innovators in the integration of brain science into the practice of psychotherapy. Using case histories from his practice, he shows how, by following the proper steps, nearly everyone can learn how to focus their attention on the internal world of the mind in a way that will literally change the wiring and architecture of their brain.     </p>
<p>                    Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal<br />
                    &#8211; a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread<br />
                    &#8211; a physician-the author himself-who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut, and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection<br />
                    &#8211; a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is like watching myself from outside myself and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting her     </p>
<p>                    These and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Emotions Are Made did what all great books do. It took a subject I thought I understood and turned my understanding upside down&#8217; &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point.    </p>
<p>                    When you feel anxious, angry, happy, or surprised, what&#8217;s really going on inside of you?     </p>
<p>                    Many scientists believe that emotions come from a specific part of the brain, triggered by the world around us. The thrill of seeing an old friend, the fear of losing someone we love &#8211; each of these sensations seems to arise automatically and uncontrollably from within us, finding expression on our faces and in our behaviour, carrying us away with the experience.    </p>
<p>                    This understanding of emotion has been around since Plato. But what if it is wrong? In How Emotions Are Made, pioneering psychologist and neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett draws on the latest scientific evidence to reveal that our common-sense ideas about emotions are dramatically, even dangerously, out of date &#8211; and that we have been paying the price. Emotions aren&#8217;t universally pre-programmed in our brains and bodies; rather they are psychological experiences that each of us constructs based on our unique personal history, physiology and environment.    </p>
<p>                    This new view of emotions has serious implications: when judges issue lesser sentences for crimes of passion, when police officers fire at threatening suspects, or when doctors choose between one diagnosis and another, they&#8217;re all, in some way, relying on the ancient assumption that emotions are hardwired into our brains and bodies. Revising that conception of emotion isn&#8217;t just good science, Barrett shows; it&#8217;s vital to our well-being and the health of society itself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible to make sense of something as elusive as creativity?     </p>
<p>                     Based on psychologist Scott Barry Kaufman&#8217;s groundbreaking research and Carolyn Gregoire&#8217;s popular article in the Huffington Post, Wired to Create offers a glimpse inside the &#8220;messy minds&#8221; of highly creative people. Revealing the latest findings in neuroscience and psychology, along with engaging examples of artists and innovators throughout history, the book shines a light on the practices and habits of mind that promote creative thinking. Kaufman and Gregoire untangle a series of paradoxes&#8211; like mindfulness and daydreaming, seriousness and play, openness and sensitivity, and solitude and collaboration &#8211; to show that it is by embracing our own contradictions that we are able to tap into our deepest creativity. Each chapter explores one of the ten attributes and habits of highly creative people:     </p>
<p>                     Imaginative Play * Passion * Daydreaming * Solitude * Intuition * Openness to Experience * Mindfulness * Sensitivity * Turning Adversity into Advantage * Thinking Differently     </p>
<p>                     With insights from the work and lives of Pablo Picasso, Frida Kahlo, Marcel Proust, David Foster Wallace, Thomas Edison, Josephine Baker, John Lennon, Michael Jackson, musician Thom Yorke, chess champion Josh Waitzkin, video-game designer Shigeru Miyamoto, and many other creative luminaries, Wired to Create helps us better understand creativity &#8211; and shows us how to enrich this essential aspect of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this fascinating and often hilarious work &#8211; winner of the Royal Society of Science Prize 2007 &#8211; pre-eminent psychologist Daniel Gilbert shows how &#8211; and why &#8211; the majority of us have no idea how to make ourselves happy.    </p>
<p>                              We all want to be happy, but do we know how? When it comes to improving tomorrow at the expense of today, we&#8217;re terrible at predicting how to please our future selves.    </p>
<p>                              In &#8216;Stumbling on Happiness&#8217; Professor Daniel Gilbert combines psychology, neuroscience, economics and philosophy with irrepressible wit to describe how the human brain imagines its future &#8211; and how well (or badly) it predicts what it will enjoy. Revealing some of the amazing secrets of human motivation, he also answers thought-provoking questions &#8211; why do dining companions order different meals instead of getting what they want? Why are shoppers happier when they can&#8217;t get refunds? And why are couples less satisfied after having children while insisting that their kids are a source of joy?</p>

A &#8220;superb travel guide: funny, knowledgeable, and self-deprecating&#8221; (The Washington Post), he explores the history of places like Vienna of 1900, Renaissance Florence, ancient Athens, Song Dynasty Hangzhou, and Silicon Valley to show how certain urban settings are conducive to ingenuity. With his trademark insightful humor, this &#8220;big-hearted humanist&#8221; (The Wall Street Journal) walks the same paths as the geniuses who flourished in these settings to see if the spirit of what inspired figures like Socrates, Michelangelo, and Leonardo remains. In these places, Weiner asks, &#8220;What was in the air, and can we bottle it?&#8221;     </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Aesthetic Brain takes readers on an exciting journey through the world of beauty, pleasure, and art. Using the latest advances in neuroscience and evolutionary psychology, Anjan Chatterjee investigates how an aesthetic sense is etched into our minds, and explains why artistic concerns feature centrally in our lives. Along the way, Chatterjee addresses such fundamental questions as: What is beauty? Is it universal? How is beauty related to pleasure? What<br />
                    is art? Should art be beautiful? Do we have an instinct for art?    </p>
<p>                    Early on, Chatterjee probes the reasons why we find people, places, and even numbers beautiful, highlighting the important relationship between beauty and pleasure. Examining our pleasures allows him to reveal why we enjoy things like food, sex, and money, and how these rewards relate to our aesthetic encounters. Chatterjee&#8217;s detailed discussion of beauty and pleasure equips readers to confront essential questions about the nature of art, the problems of defining it, and the challenges of<br />
                    interpreting its modern, non-traditional forms. Replete with facts, anecdotes, and analogies, this lively empirical guide to aesthetics offers scientific answers to fundamental questions without deflating the intrinsic wonders of beauty and art in an affordable paperback edition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author of the acclaimed Proust and the Squid follows up with a lively, ambitious, and deeply informative book that considers the future of the reading brain and our capacity for critical thinking, empathy, and reflection as we become increasingly dependent on digital technologies.    </p>
<p>                    A decade ago, Maryanne Wolf&#8217;s Proust and the Squid revealed what we know about how the brain learns to read and how reading changes the way we think and feel. Since then, the ways we process written language have changed dramatically with many concerned about both their own changes and that of children. New research on the reading brain chronicles these changes in the brains of children and adults as they learn to read while immersed in a digitally dominated medium.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing deeply on this research, this book comprises a series of letters Wolf writes to us&#8211;her beloved readers&#8211;to describe her concerns and her hopes about what is happening to the reading brain as it unavoidably changes to adapt to digital mediums. Wolf raises difficult questions, including: Will children learn to incorporate the full range of deep reading processes that are at the core of the expert reading brain?Will the mix of a seemingly infinite set of distractions for children&#8217;s attention and their quick access to immediate, voluminous information alter their ability to think for themselves?With information at their fingertips, will the next generation learn to build their own storehouse of knowledge, which could impede the ability to make analogies and draw inferences from what they know?Will all these influences change the formation in children and the use in adults of slower cognitive processes like critical thinking, personal reflection, imagination, and empathy that comprise deep reading and that influence both how we think and how we live our lives?How can we preserve deep reading processes in future iterations of the reading brain?    </p>
<p>                    Concerns about attention span, critical reasoning, and over-reliance on technology are never just about children&#8211;Wolf herself has found that, though she is a reading expert, her ability to read deeply has been impacted as she has become increasingly dependent on screens.    </p>
<p>                    Wolf draws on neuroscience, literature, education, and philosophy and blends historical, literary, and scientific facts with down-to-earth examples and warm anecdotes to illuminate complex ideas that culminate in a proposal for a biliterate reading brain. Provocative and intriguing, Reader, Come Home is a roadmap that provides a cautionary but hopeful perspective on the impact of technology on our brains and our most essential intellectual capacities&#8211;and what this could mean for our future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To compete with today&#8217;s increasing globalization and rapidly evolving technologies, individuals and organizations must take their ability to learn-the foundation for continuous improvement, operational excellence, and innovation-to a much higher level. In Learn or Die, Edward D. Hess combines recent advances in neuroscience, psychology, behavioral economics, and education with key research on high-performance businesses to create an actionable blueprint for becoming a leading-edge learning organization. Learn or Die examines the process of learning from an individual and an organizational standpoint. From an individual perspective, the book discusses the cognitive, emotional, motivational, attitudinal, and behavioral factors that promote better learning. Organizationally, Learn or Die focuses on the kinds of structures, culture, leadership, employee learning behaviors, and human resource policies that are necessary to create an environment that enables critical and innovative thinking, learning conversations, and collaboration.<br />
                    The volume also provides strategies to mitigate the reality that humans can be reflexive, lazy thinkers who seek confirmation of what they believe to be true and affirmation of their self-image. Exemplar learning organizations discussed include the secretive Bridgewater Associates, LP; Intuit, Inc.; United Parcel Service (UPS); W. L. Gore &#038; Associates; and IDEO.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The scientific evidence behind why we should maintain a lifestyle more like that of our ancestors to restore our health and well-being.     </p>
<p>                    In GO WILD, Harvard Medical School professor John Ratey, MD, and journalist Richard Manning reveal that although civilization has rapidly evolved, our bodies stopped changing long ago&#8211;creating a disconnect between how we live and what is best for us. This disconnect affects every area of our lives, from our energy levels to our relationships to our general health. Only by using ancient evolutionary instructions to navigate modern life can we realize our true potential in everything including strength, health and well-being, intelligence, happiness, and more. The book addresses modern diseases (from diabetes to cancer to addiction); the problems of the modern diet; exercise; sleep; mindfulness and relationships; and much more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Want to be a lifelong learner? Think small. Forget spending 10,000 hours in the pursuit of perfecting just one thing.

Combining positive psychology, neuroscience, self-help and more, this delightfully illuminating book encourages us to circumvent all the reasons we can&#8217;t learn and grow (we&#8217;re too busy, it&#8217;s too complicated, we&#8217;re not experts, we didn&#8217;t start when we were young) &#8212; by tackling small, satisfying skills. Wish you were a seasoned chef? Learn to make a perfect omelette. Dream of being a racecar driver? Perfect a handbrake turn. Wish you could draw? Make Zen circles your first challenge. These small, doable tasks offer a big payoff &#8212; and motivate us to keep learning and growing, with payoffs that include a boost in optimism, confidence, memory, cognitive skills, and more. Filled with surprising insights and even a compendium of micromastery skills to try yourself, this engaging and inspiring guide reminds us of the simple joy of learning &#8212; and opens the door to limitless, lifelong achievement, one small step at a time. Micromasteries presented in the book (with illustrations) include: Learn How to Climb a Rope, Surf Standing Up, Talk for Fifteen Minutes about Any Subject, Bake Artisan Bread, Juggle Four Balls, Learn to Read Japanese in Three Hours, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A first class book&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re all conspiracy theorists. Some of us just hide it better than others.    </p>
<p>                    Conspiracy theorists do not wear tin-foil hats (for the most part). They are not just a few kooks lurking on the paranoid fringes of society with bizarre ideas about shape-shifting reptilian aliens running society in secret. They walk among us. They are us.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone loves a good conspiracy. Yet conspiracy theories are not a recent invention. And they are not always a harmless curiosity. In Suspicious Minds, Rob Brotherton explores the history and consequences of conspiracism, and delves into the research that offers insights into why so many of us are drawn to implausible, unproven and unproveable conspiracy theories. They resonate with some of our brain&#8217;s built-in quirks and foibles, and tap into some of our deepest desires, fears, and assumptions about the world.     </p>
<p>                    The fascinating and often surprising psychology of conspiracy theories tells us a lot &#8211; not just why we are drawn to theories about sinister schemes, but about how our minds are wired and, indeed, why we believe anything at all. Conspiracy theories are not some psychological aberration &#8211; they&#8217;re a predictable product of how brains work. This book will tell you why, and what it means.    </p>
<p>                    Of course, just because your brain&#8217;s biased doesn&#8217;t always mean you&#8217;re wrong. Sometimes conspiracies are real. Sometimes, paranoia is prudent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Daily Telegraph and TLS Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;An audacious tour of all that science can teach us&#8217; Edward O. Wilson    </p>
<p>                    Specialist scientific fields are developing at incredibly swift speeds, but what can they really tell us about how the universe began and how humans evolved to play such a dominant role on Earth? John Hands&#8217;s extraordinarily ambitious quest brings together our scientific knowledge and evaluates the theories and evidence about the origin and evolution of matter, life, consciousness, and humankind.    </p>
<p>                    Cosmosapiens provides the most comprehensive account yet of current ideas such as cosmic inflation, dark energy, the selfish gene, and neurogenetic determinism. In clear and accessible language, Hands differentiates the firmly established from the speculative and examines the claims of various fields such as string theory to approach a unified theory of everything. In doing so he challenges the orthodox consensus in those branches of cosmology, biology, and neuroscience that have ossified into dogma. His striking analysis reveals underlying patterns of cooperation, complexification, and convergence that lead to the unique emergence in humans of a self-reflective consciousness that enables us to determine our future evolution. This groundbreaking book is destined to become a classic of scientific thinking.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human mind is both brilliant and pathetic. We have mastered fire and have stood on the moon, and yet every one of us is fundamentally ignorant, irrational and prone to making simple mistakes every day.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;In The Knowledge Illusion, the cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach hammer another nail into the coffin of the rational individual . . . positing that not just rationality but the very idea of individual thinking is a myth.&#8217;<br />
                    Yuval Harari, bestselling author of Sapiens and Homo Deus    </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking book, cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach show how our success as a species is down to us living in a rich community of knowledge where we are drawing on information and expertise outside our heads. And we have no idea that we are even doing it.    </p>
<p>                    Utilizing cutting-edge research, The Knowledge Illusion explains why we think we know more than we do, why beliefs are so hard to change and why we are so prone to making mistakes. Providing a blueprint for successful ways to work in collaboration to do amazing things, it reveals why the key to human intelligence lies in the way we think and work together.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Human beings are primates, and primates are political animals. Our brains, therefore, are designed not just to hunt and gather, but also to help us get ahead socially, often via deception and self-deception. But while we may be self-interested schemers, we benefit by pretending otherwise. The less we know about our own ugly motives, the better &#8211; and thus we don&#8217;t like to talk or even think about the extent of our selfishness. This is &#8220;the elephant in the brain.&#8221; Such<br />
                    an introspective taboo makes it hard for us to think clearly about our nature and the explanations for our behavior. The aim of this book, then, is to confront our hidden motives directly &#8211; to track down the darker, unexamined corners of our psyches and blast them with floodlights. Then, once<br />
                    everything is clearly visible, we can work to better understand ourselves: Why do we laugh? Why are artists sexy? Why do we brag about travel? Why do we prefer to speak rather than listen?    </p>
<p>                    Our unconscious motives drive more than just our private behavior; they also infect our venerated social institutions such as Art, School, Charity, Medicine, Politics, and Religion. In fact, these institutions are in many ways designed to accommodate our hidden motives, to serve covert agendas alongside their &#8220;official&#8221; ones. The existence of big hidden motives can upend the usual political debates, leading one to question the legitimacy of these social institutions, and of standard policies<br />
                    designed to favor or discourage them. You won&#8217;t see yourself &#8211; or the world &#8211; the same after confronting the elephant in the brain.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If I&#8217;ve done my job well &#8211; and, let&#8217;s be honest, if I&#8217;m lucky &#8211; you&#8217;ll read to the end of this piece of copy. Most likely, however, you won&#8217;t. Somewhere in the middle of the next paragraph, your mind will wander off. Minds wander. That&#8217;s just how it is.  That may be bad news for me, but is it bad news for people in general? Does the fact that as much as fifty percent of our waking hours find us failing to focus on the task at hand represent a problem? Michael Corballis doesn&#8217;t think so, and with The Wandering Mind, he shows us why, rehabilitating woolgathering and revealing its incredibly useful effects. Drawing on the latest research from cognitive science and evolutionary biology, Corballis shows us how mind-wandering not only frees us from moment-to-moment drudgery, but also from the limitations of our immediate selves. Mind-wandering strengthens our imagination, fueling the flights of invention, storytelling, and empathy that underlie our shared humanity; furthermore, he explains, our tendency to wander back and forth through the timeline of our lives is fundamental to our very sense of ourselves as coherent, continuing personalities.<br />
                    Full of unusual examples and surprising discoveries, The Wandering Mind mounts a vigorous defense of inattention- &#8211; even as it never fails to hold the reader&#8217;s.</p>

<p>                    Psychologists have long been aware that most people tend to maintain an irrationally positive outlook on life. In fact, optimism may be crucial to our existence. Tali Sharot&#8217;s original cognitive research demonstrates in surprising ways the biological basis for optimism. In this fascinating exploration, she takes an in-depth, clarifying look at how the brain generates hope and what happens when it fails; how the brains of optimists and pessimists differ; why we are terrible at predicting what will make us happy; how anticipation and dread affect us; and how our optimistic illusions affect our financial, professional, and emotional decisions.    </p>
<p>                    With its cutting-edge science and its wide-ranging and accessible narrative, The Optimism Bias provides us with startling new insight into how the workings of the brain create our hopes and dreams.</p>

<p>                     In the last twenty years, meditation and mindfulness have gone from being kind of cool to becoming an omnipresent Band-Aid for fixing everything from your weight to your relationship to your achievement level. Unveiling here the kind of cutting-edge research that has made them giants in their fields, Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson show us the truth about what meditation can really do for us, as well as exactly how to get the most out of it.     </p>
<p>                    Sweeping away common misconceptions and neuromythology to open readers&#8217; eyes to the ways data has been distorted to sell mind-training methods, the authors demonstrate that beyond the pleasant states mental exercises can produce, the real payoffs are the lasting personality traits that can result. But short daily doses will not get us to the highest level of lasting positive change&#8211;even if we continue for years&#8211;without specific additions. More than sheer hours, we need smart practice, including crucial ingredients such as targeted feedback from a master teacher and a more spacious, less attached view of the self, all of which are missing in widespread versions of mind training. The authors also reveal the latest data from Davidson&#8217;s own lab that point to a new methodology for developing a broader array of mind-training methods with larger implications for how we can derive the greatest benefits from the practice.     </p>
<p>                    Exciting, compelling, and grounded in new research, this is one of those rare books that has the power to change us at the deepest level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Elegant prose and excellent reporting . . . By the time I had finished reading, I had underlined many intriguing ideas.&#8221;&#8211;New York Times Book Review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;No doubt Inventology will be marketed to the creative business class, but there&#8217;s ample interest here even for readers who aren&#8217;t actively inventing anything.&#8221;&#8211;Boston Globe     </p>
<p>                     A doctor realizes that an innocent-looking tube is killing his patients, then reads a newspaper article that inspires him to create a better version that serves as an early warning system for infections. A father cleans up after his toddler and builds a &#8220;sippy&#8221; cup that won&#8217;t spill. An engineer dreams of a different world and pioneers the cell phone.     </p>
<p>                     By studying breakthroughs like these, we can learn how people imagine their way around &#8220;impossible&#8221; problems to discover groundbreaking answers. Pagan Kennedy reports on how enduring methods of invention can be adapted to the twenty-first century, as millions of us deploy tools like crowdfunding, big data, and 3-D printing to address our needs or realize our dreams. Drawing on fresh research and the surprising stories behind many inventions old and new to reveal the steps that most reliably produce discovery, Inventology is a myth-shattering book and a must-read for anyone who is curious about creativity and the mental leaps required to solve our most challenging problems.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;&#8216;Inventology&#8217; may be a real science; researchers are beginning to study it, and teachers are teaching it . . . A delightful account of how inventors do what they do.&#8221;&#8211;Kirkus Reviews, starred review     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Offers a new perspective into the process of invention that will inform and illuminate.&#8221;&#8211;Publishers Weekly</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re all hypocrites. Why? Hypocrisy is the natural state of the human mind. Robert Kurzban shows us that the key to understanding our behavioral inconsistencies lies in understanding the mind&#8217;s design. The human mind consists of many specialized units designed by the process of evolution by natural selection. While these modules sometimes work together seamlessly, they don&#8217;t always, resulting in impossibly contradictory beliefs, vacillations between patience and impulsiveness, violations of our supposed moral principles, and overinflated views of ourselves. This modular, evolutionary psychological view of the mind undermines deeply held intuitions about ourselves, as well as a range of scientific theories that require a &#8220;self&#8221; with consistent beliefs and preferences. Modularity suggests that there is no &#8220;I&#8221;. Instead, each of us is a contentious &#8220;we&#8221; &#8211; a collection of discrete but interacting systems whose constant conflicts shape our interactions with one another and our experience of the world.<br />
                    In clear language, full of wit and rich in examples, Kurzban explains the roots and implications of our inconsistent minds, and why it is perfectly natural to believe that everyone else is a hypocrite.</p>

<p>                    In the vein of Susan Cain&#8217;s QUIET and Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s DAVID AND GOLIATH, HOW TO FLY A HORSE is a smart, empowering book that dispels the myths around genius and creativity.    </p>
<p>                    There is a myth about how something new comes to be; that geniuses have dramatic moments of insight where great things and thoughts are born whole. Symphonies are composed complete. Science is accomplished with eureka shrieks. Businesses are built by magic touch.    </p>
<p>                    The myth is wrong. Anyone can create.     </p>
<p>                    Acclaimed technology pioneer Kevin Ashton takes us behind the scenes of creation to reveal the true process of discovery and how &#8216;new&#8217; comes to be. From Archimedes to Apple, from Kandinsky to the Coke can, from the Wright brothers &#8211; who set out to &#8216;fly a horse&#8217; &#8211; to Woody Allen, he exposes the seemingly unremarkable individuals, gradual steps, multiple failures and countless ordinary and often uncredited acts that led to our most astounding breakthroughs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wall Street Journal bestseller!     </p>
<p>                    Poker champion turned business consultant Annie Duke teaches you how to get comfortable with uncertainty and make better decisions as a result.     </p>
<p>                    In Super Bowl XLIX, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll made one of the most controversial calls in football history: With 26 seconds remaining, and trailing by four at the Patriots&#8217; one-yard line, he called for a pass instead of a hand off to his star running back. The pass was intercepted and the Seahawks lost. Critics called it the dumbest play in history. But was the call really that bad? Or did Carroll actually make a great move that was ruined by bad luck?     </p>
<p>                    Even the best decision doesn&#8217;t yield the best outcome every time. There&#8217;s always an element of luck that you can&#8217;t control, and there is always information that is hidden from view. So the key to long-term success (and avoiding worrying yourself to death) is to think in bets: How sure am I? What are the possible ways things could turn out? What decision has the highest odds of success? Did I land in the unlucky 10% on the strategy that works 90% of the time? Or is my success attributable to dumb luck rather than great decision making?     </p>
<p>                    Annie Duke, a former World Series of Poker champion turned business consultant, draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and (of course) poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. For most people, it&#8217;s difficult to say I&#8217;m not sure in a world that values and, even, rewards the appearance of certainty. But professional poker players are comfortable with the fact that great decisions don&#8217;t always lead to great outcomes and bad decisions don&#8217;t always lead to bad outcomes.     </p>
<p>                    By shifting your thinking from a need for certainty to a goal of accurately assessing what you know and what you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be less vulnerable to reactive emotions, knee-jerk biases, and destructive habits in your decision making. You&#8217;ll become more confident, calm, compassionate and successful in the long run.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every human is born with multifarious potential. Why, then, do parents, schools and employers insist that we restrict our many talents and interests; that we &#8216;specialise&#8217; in just one?     </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;ve been sold a myth, that to &#8216;specialise&#8217; is the only way to pursue truth, identity, or even a livelihood. Yet specialisation is nothing but an outdated system that fosters ignorance, exploitation and disillusionment and thwarts creativity, opportunity and progress.     </p>
<p>                    Following a series of exchanges with the world&#8217;s greatest historians, futurists, philosophers and scientists, Waqas Ahmed has weaved together a narrative of history and a vision for the future that seeks to disrupt this prevailing system of unwarranted &#8216;hyper-specialisation.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    In The Polymath, Waqas shows us that there is another way of thinking and being. Through an approach that is both philosophical and practical, he sets out a cognitive journey towards reclaiming your innate polymathic state. Going further, he proposes nothing less than a cultural revolution in our education and professional structures, whereby everyone is encouraged to express themselves in multiple ways and fulfil their many-sided potential.     </p>
<p>                    Not only does this enhance individual fulfilment, but in doing so, facilitates a conscious and creative society that is both highly motivated and well equipped to address the complexity of 21st century challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk and Subliminal, this is the inspiring and illuminating story of how we have come to understand the world, from the invention of the very first tools to the mind-bending theories of quantum physics.    </p>
<p>                    Leonard Mlodinow guides us through the critical eras and events in the development of science, all of which, he demonstrates, were propelled forward by humankind&#8217;s collective struggle to know. From the birth of reasoning and culture to the formation of the studies of physics, chemistry, biology, and modern-day quantum physics, we come to see that much of our progress can be attributed to simple questions &#8211; why? how? &#8211; bravely asked. Mlodinow profiles some of the great philosophers, scientists, and thinkers who explored these questions &#8211; Aristotle, Galileo, Newton, Darwin, Einstein and Lavoisier among them &#8211; and makes clear that just as science has played a key role in shaping the patterns of human thought, human subjectivity has played a key role in the evolution of science.    </p>
<p>                    At once authoritative and accessible, and infused with the author&#8217;s trademark wit, this deeply insightful book is a stunning tribute to humanity&#8217;s intellectual curiosity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the centuries since Descartes famously proclaimed, &#8216;I think, therefore I am,&#8217; science has often overlooked emotions as the source of a person&#8217;s true being. Even modern neuroscience has tended until recently to concentrate on the cognitive aspects of brain function, disregarding emotions. This attitude began to change with the publication of Descartes&#8217; Error. Antonio Damasio challenged traditional ideas about the connection between emotions and rationality. In this wonderfully engaging book, Damasio takes the reader on a journey of scientific discovery through a series of case studies, demonstrating what many of us have long suspected: emotions are not a luxury, they are essential to rational thinking and to normal social behaviour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A New York Times bestseller!     </p>
<p>                    A revelatory look at how our environment unconsciously yet dramatically shapes the judgments and decisions we make every day    </p>
<p>                    Most of us go through life believing that we are in control of the choices we make-that we think and behave almost independently from the world around us. But as Drunk Tank Pink illustrates, the truth is our environment shapes our thoughts and actions in myriad ways without our permission or even our knowledge. Armed with surprising data and endlessly fascinating examples, Adam Alter addresses the subtle but substantial ways in which outside forces influence us-such as color&#8217;s influence on mood, our bias in favor of names with which we identify, and how sunny days can induce optimism as well as aggression. Drunk Tank Pink proves that the truth behind our feelings and actions goes much deeper than the choices we take for granted every day.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For centuries, experts have argued that learning was about memorizing information: You&#8217;re supposed to study facts, dates, and details; burn them into your memory; and then apply that knowledge at opportune times. But this approach to learning isn&#8217;t nearly enough for the world that we live in today, and in Learn Better journalist and education researcher Ulrich Boser demonstrates that how we learn can matter just as much as what we learn.     </p>
<p>                    In this brilliantly researched book, Boser maps out the new science of learning, showing how simple techniques like comprehension check-ins and making material personally relatable can help people gain expertise in dramatically better ways. He covers six key steps to help you &#8220;learn how to learn,&#8221; all illuminated with fascinating stories like how Jackson Pollock developed his unique painting style and why an ancient Japanese counting device allows kids to do math at superhuman speeds. Boser&#8217;s witty, engaging writing makes this book feel like a guilty pleasure, not homework.    </p>
<p>                    Learn Better will revolutionize the way students and society alike approach learning and makes the case that being smart is not an innate ability&#8211;learning is a skill everyone can master. With Boser as your guide, you will be able to fully capitalize on your brain&#8217;s remarkable ability to gain new skills and open up a whole new world of possibilities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A riveting look at the birth of a new science.&#8221; -Daniel H. Pink, author of Drive    </p>
<p>                    When he was eight years old, Dan Hurley was labeled a &#8220;slow learner&#8221; because he still couldn&#8217;t read.  Three years later, he had become a straight A student.     </p>
<p>                    Until the publication of a major study in 2008, psychologists believed that intelligence is fixed at birth, that IQ is like a number tattooed on the soul. The new study showed that people can increase their &#8220;fluid&#8221; intelligence through training.    </p>
<p>                    Hurley, who grew up to become an award-winning science journalist, first explored the topic in The New York Times Magazine. In Smarter, he digs deeper by meeting with the field&#8217;s leading researchers-and becoming a human guinea pig. After just three months of playing computer brain-training games, joining a boot-camp exercise program, learning to play the Renaissance lute, practicing mindfulness meditation and and even getting his brain zapped in the name of science, Hurley improved his fluid intelligence by sixteen percent.    </p>
<p>                    With humor and heart, Smarter chronicles the roiling field of intelligence research and delivers practical findings to sharpen the minds of children, young adults, seniors, and those with cognitive challenges.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From dogs to gods, dive into the science of mysterious minds&#8211;including your own.     </p>
<p>                    Nothing seems more real than the minds of other people. When you consider what your boss is thinking or whether your spouse is happy, you are admitting them into the &#8220;mind club.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to assume other humans can think and feel, but what about a cow, a computer, a corporation? What kinds of minds do they have?     </p>
<p>                    Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray are award-winning psychologists who have discovered that minds&#8211;while incredibly important&#8211;are a matter of perception. Their research opens a trove of new findings, with insights into human behavior that are fascinating, frightening, and funny. The Mind Club explains why we love some animals and eat others, why people debate the existence of God so intensely, how good people can be so cruel, and why robots make such poor lovers. By investigating the mind perception of extraordinary targets&#8211;animals, machines, comatose people, God&#8211;Wegner and Gray explain what it means to have a mind and why it matters so much.     </p>
<p>                    Fusing cutting-edge research and personal anecdotes, The Mind Club explores the moral dimensions of mind perception with wit and compassion, revealing the surprisingly simple basis for what compels us to love and hate, to harm and to protect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the bestselling author of The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk and coauthor of The Grand Design (with Stephen Hawking), a startling and eye-opening examination of how the unconscious mind shapes our experience of the world.     </p>
<p>                     Winner of the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award     </p>
<p>                     Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world&#8211;our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment&#8211;is largely driven by the mind&#8217;s subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events&#8211;along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A fascinating exploration of how computer algorithms can be applied to our everyday lives.    </p>
<p>                              In this dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show us how the simple, precise algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. Modern life is constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? The authors explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others.    </p>
<p>                              From finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one&#8217;s inbox to understanding the workings of human memory, Algorithms To Live By is full of practical takeaways to help you solve common decision-making problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity&#8211;and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy    </p>
<p>                     Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. Whether it&#8217;s a confounding work problem or a faltering relationship or an unclear medical diagnosis, we face constant uncertainty. And we&#8217;re continually bombarded with information, much of it contradictory.     </p>
<p>                     Managing ambiguity&#8211;in our jobs, our relationships, and daily lives&#8211;is quickly becoming an essential skill. Yet most of us don&#8217;t know where to begin.     </p>
<p>                     As Jamie Holmes shows in Nonsense, being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We&#8217;re hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. This can be useful, of course. When a tiger is chasing you, you can&#8217;t be indecisive. But as Nonsense reveals, our need for closure has its own dangers. It makes us stick to our first answer, which is not always the best, and it makes us search for meaning in the wrong places. When we latch onto fast and easy truths, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective.     </p>
<p>                     In other words, confusion&#8211;that uncomfortable mental place&#8211;has a hidden upside. We just need to know how to use it. This lively and original book points the way.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Filled with illuminating stories&#8211;from spy games and doomsday cults to Absolut Vodka&#8217;s ad campaign and the creation of Mad Libs&#8211;Nonsense promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions.     </p>
<p>                     In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn&#8217;t IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It&#8217;s how we deal with what we don&#8217;t understand.</p>

                    ___________________________________________________<br />
                     Overwhelmed by demands on your time? Baffled by the sheer volume of data?<br />
                    You&#8217;re not alone. Even the smartest mind can&#8217;t beat the organized mind &#8211; when we&#8217;re unable to make sense of it all, our creativity plummets, our decision making suffers and we grow absent-minded. Nowadays, we drown under emails, forever juggle six tasks at once and try to make complex decisions ever more quickly. This is information overload.    </p>
<p>                     Using a combination of academic research and examples from daily life, Daniel Levitin explains how to take back control of your life, from healthcare to online dating to raising kids, showing that the secret to success is always organization. You&#8217;ll discover life-changing facts about:    </p>
<p>                     &#8211; How to make the most of your brain&#8217;s daily processing limit<br />
                     &#8211; Why pressing Send or clicking Like are addictive<br />
                     &#8211; Why daydreaming is your brain at its most productive<br />
                     &#8211; What the most successful people keep in their drawer<br />
                     &#8211; Why multitasking is a bad way to do nearly everything    </p>
<p>                     In a world where information is power, The Organized Mind holds the key to harnessing that information and making it work for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Csikszentmihalyi arrives at an insight that many of us can intuitively grasp, despite our insistent (and culturally supported) denial of this truth. That is, it is not what happens to us that determines our happiness, but the manner in which we make sense of that reality. . . . The manner in which Csikszentmihalyi integrates research on consciousness, personal psychology and spirituality is illuminating.&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times Book Review    </p>
<p>                    The bestselling classic that holds the key to unlocking meaning, creativity, peak performance, and true happiness.     </p>
<p>                    Legendary psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi&#8217;s famous investigations of optimal experience have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. In this new edition of his groundbreaking classic work, Csikszentmihalyi (the leading researcher into &#8216;flow states&#8217; &#8211;Newsweek) demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In those times when we want to acquire a new skill or face a formidable challenge we hope to overcome, what we need most are patience, focus, and discipline, traits that seem elusive or difficult to maintain. In this enticing and practical book, Thomas Sterner demonstrates how to learn skills for any aspect of life, from golfing to business to parenting, by learning to love the process. Early life is all about trial-and-error practice. If we had given up in the face of failure, repetition, and difficulty, we would never have learned to walk or tie our shoes. So why, as adults, do we often give up on a goal when at first we don&#8217;t succeed? In his study of how we learn (prompted by his pursuit of disciplines such as music and golf), Sterner has found that we have forgotten the principles of practice &#8212; the process of picking a goal and applying steady effort to reach it. The methods Sterner teaches show that practice done properly isn&#8217;t drudgery on the way to mastery but a fulfilling process in and of itself, one that builds discipline and clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A FINANCIAL TIMES BUSINESS BOOK OF THE MONTH (APRIL 2017)  Humans have become subservient to algorithms. Every day brings a new Moneyball fix &#8211; a maths whiz who will crack open an industry with clean fact-based analysis rather than human intuition and experience. As a result, we have stopped thinking. Machines do it for us. Christian Madsbjerg argues that our fixation with data often masks stunning deficiencies, and the risks for humankind are enormous. Blind devotion to number crunching imperils our businesses, our educations, our governments, and our life savings. Too many companies have lost touch with the humanity of their customers, while marginalising workers with arts-based skills. Contrary to popular thinking, Madsbjerg shows how many of today&#8217;s biggest success stories stem not from &#8216;quant&#8217; thinking but from deep, nuanced engagement with culture, language, and history. He calls his method sensemaking. In this landmark book, Madsbjerg lays out five principles for how business leaders, entrepreneurs, and individuals can use it to solve their thorniest problems.<br />
                    He profiles companies using sensemaking to connect with new customers, and takes readers inside the work process of sensemaking &#8216;connoisseurs&#8217; like investor George Soros, architect Bjarke Ingels, and others. Both practical and philosophical, Sensemaking is a powerful rejoinder to corporate groupthink and an indispensable resource for leaders and innovators who want to stand out from the pack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A riveting ride through your own brain&#8217; &#8211; Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Originals    </p>
<p>                    WINNER of the Society for Personality and Social Psychology&#8217;s book prize for &#8216;The Promotion of Social and Personality Science&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    If humans are fundamentally good, why do we engage in acts of great cruelty? If we are evil, why do we sometimes help others at a cost to ourselves?     </p>
<p>                    Whether humans are good or evil is a question that has plagued philosophers and scientists for as long as there have been philosophers and scientists.    </p>
<p>                    Many argue that we are fundamentally selfish, and only the rules and laws of our societies and our own relentless efforts of will can save us from ourselves. But is this really true?     </p>
<p>                    Abigail Marsh is a social neuroscientist who has closely studied the brains of both the worst and the best among us-from children with psychopathic traits whose families live in fear of them, to adult altruists who have given their own kidneys to strangers. Her groundbreaking findings suggest a possibility that is more optimistic than the dominant view. Humans are not good or evil, but are equally (and fundamentally) capable of good and evil.    </p>
<p>                    In The Fear Factor Marsh explores the human capacity for caring, drawing on cutting edge research findings from clinical, translational and brain imaging investigations on the nature of empathy, altruism, and aggression and brings us closer to understanding the basis of humans&#8217; social nature.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;You won&#8217;t be able to put it down&#8217; &#8211; Daniel Gilbert, New York Times bestselling author of Stumbling on Happiness    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;[It] reads like a thriller&#8230; One of the most mind-opening books I have read in years&#8217; &#8211; Matthieu Ricard, author of Altruism</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to creating ideas, we hold ourselves back. That&#8217;s because inside each of us is an internal editor whose job is to forever polish our thoughts so we sound smart and in control and so we fit into society.     </p>
<p>                     But what happens when we encounter problems where such conventional thinking fails us? How do we get unstuck?     </p>
<p>                     For Mark Levy, the answer is freewriting, a technique he&#8217;s used for years to solve all types of business problems and generate ideas for books, articles, and blog posts.     </p>
<p>                     Freewriting is deceptively simple: start writing as fast as you can, for as long as you can, about a subject you care deeply about, while ignoring the standard rules of grammar and spelling. Your internal editor won&#8217;t be able to keep up with your output&#8211;you&#8217;ll generate breakthrough ideas and solutions that you couldn&#8217;t have created any other way.     </p>
<p>                     Levy shares his six secrets to freewriting as well as fifteen problem-solving and creativity-stimulating principles you can use if you need more firepower&#8211;seven of which are new to this edition. Also new to this edition: an extensive section on how to refine your raw freewriting into something you can share with the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why our brains aren&#8217;t built for media multitasking, and how we can learn to live with technology in a more balanced way.    </p>
<p>                    Brilliant and practical, just what we need in these techno-human times.&#8211;Jack Kornfield, author of The Wise Heart    </p>
<p>                    Most of us will freely admit that we are obsessed with our devices. We pride ourselves on our ability to multitask&#8211;read work email, reply to a text, check Facebook, watch a video clip. Talk on the phone, send a text, drive a car. Enjoy family dinner with a glowing smartphone next to our plates. We can do it all, 24/7! Never mind the errors in the email, the near-miss on the road, and the unheard conversation at the table. In The Distracted Mind, Adam Gazzaley and Larry Rosen&#8211;a neuroscientist and a psychologist&#8211;explain why our brains aren&#8217;t built for multitasking, and suggest better ways to live in a high-tech world without giving up our modern technology.    </p>
<p>                    The authors explain that our brains are limited in their ability to pay attention. We don&#8217;t really multitask but rather switch rapidly between tasks. Distractions and interruptions, often technology-related&#8211;referred to by the authors as &#8220;interference&#8221;&#8211;collide with our goal-setting abilities. We want to finish this paper/spreadsheet/sentence, but our phone signals an incoming message and we drop everything. Even without an alert, we decide that we &#8220;must&#8221; check in on social media immediately.    </p>
<p>                    Gazzaley and Rosen offer practical strategies, backed by science, to fight distraction. We can change our brains with meditation, video games, and physical exercise; we can change our behavior by planning our accessibility and recognizing our anxiety about being out of touch even briefly. They don&#8217;t suggest that we give up our devices, but that we use them in a more balanced way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For more than two decades, psychologist and journalist Daniel Goleman has been scouting the leading edge of the human sciences for what&#8217;s new, surprising, and important. In Focus, he delves into the science of attention in all its varieties, presenting a long overdue discussion of this little-noticed and under-rated mental asset that matters enormously for how we navigate life.     </p>
<p>                    Goleman boils down attention research into a three parts: inner, other, and outer focus. Goleman shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, as demonstrated by rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business.  Those who excel rely on what Goleman calls Smart Practices such as mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental &#8216;prosthetics&#8217; that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain excellence. Combining cutting-edge research with practical findings, Focus reveals what distinguishes experts from amateurs and stars from average performers.</p>

<p>                    Twenty years ago, The Seven Sins of Memory offered the first framework that explained common memory vices&#8211;and their surprising virtues. Now, in this updated edition, Daniel L. Schacter revisits his groundbreaking research with the twenty-first century&#8217;s cultural trends and scientific discoveries. How does our ever-increasing reliance on Google, Instagram, and other websites harm our mind&#8217;s ability to store and retrieve memories? How has repeated exposure to &#8220;fake news&#8221; and other false statements increased our bias and made it easier for us to think these statements are true? Exploring the memory miscues that occur in everyday life&#8211;absentmindedness, transience, blocking, misattribution, suggestibility, bias, and persistence&#8211;Schacter delves into the striking scientific research, giving us a glimpse of the fascinating neurology of memory. Together, the stories and the scientific results provide a new look at our brains and at what we more generally think of as our minds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the inventor of the PalmPilot comes a new and compelling theory of intelligence, brain function, and the future of intelligent machines     </p>
<p>                    Jeff Hawkins, the man who created the PalmPilot, Treo smart phone, and other handheld devices, has reshaped our relationship to computers. Now he stands ready to revolutionize both neuroscience and computing in one stroke, with a new understanding of intelligence itself.     </p>
<p>                    Hawkins develops a powerful theory of how the human brain works, explaining why computers are not intelligent and how, based on this new theory, we can finally build intelligent machines.     </p>
<p>                    The brain is not a computer, but a memory system that stores experiences in a way that reflects the true structure of the world, remembering sequences of events and their nested relationships and making predictions based on those memories. It is this memory-prediction system that forms the basis of intelligence, perception, creativity, and even consciousness.     </p>
<p>                    In an engaging style that will captivate audiences from the merely curious to the professional scientist, Hawkins shows how a clear understanding of how the brain works will make it possible for us to build intelligent machines, in silicon, that will exceed our human ability in surprising ways.     </p>
<p>                    Written with acclaimed science writer Sandra Blakeslee, On Intelligence promises to completely transfigure the possibilities of the technology age. It is a landmark book in its scope and clarity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.    </p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.    </p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.     </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A guide to critical thinking in the &#8216;post-truth&#8217; era, from the author of Sunday Times best-seller The Organized Mind     </p>
<p>                    We live in a world where the line between truth and lies is increasingly blurred by euphemistic terms such as &#8216;post-truth&#8217;, &#8216;counter-knowledge&#8217;, &#8216;fringe theories&#8217; and others. In a world where anyone can become an expert at the click of a button, we&#8217;re worse equipped than ever to evaluate the  information we encounter and separate the truth from the lies.  Daniel Levitin debunks the idea that truth no longer exists, and shows that we urgently need to learn the skills toeffectively ask ourselves: can we really know that? And how do they know that?     </p>
<p>                    In this eye-opening, accessible guide filled with fascinating examples and practical takeaways, acclaimed neuroscientist Daniel Levitin shows us how learning to understand statistics will enable you to make better, smarter judgements on the world around you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An expert explores the riddle of subjective time, from why time speeds up as we grow older to the connection between time and consciousness.    </p>
<p>                    We have widely varying perceptions of time. Children have trouble waiting for anything. (&#8220;Are we there yet?&#8221;) Boredom is often connected to our sense of time passing (or not passing). As people grow older, time seems to speed up, the years flitting by without a pause. How does our sense of time come about? In Felt Time, Marc Wittmann explores the riddle of subjective time, explaining our perception of time&#8211;whether moment by moment, or in terms of life as a whole. Drawing on the latest insights from psychology and neuroscience, Wittmann offers a new answer to the question of how we experience time.    </p>
<p>                    Wittmann explains, among other things, how we choose between savoring the moment and deferring gratification; why impulsive people are bored easily, and why their boredom is often a matter of time; whether each person possesses a personal speed, a particular brain rhythm distinguishing quick people from slow people; and why the feeling of duration can serve as an &#8220;error signal,&#8221; letting us know when it is taking too long for dinner to be ready or for the bus to come. He considers the practice of mindfulness, and whether it can reduce the speed of life and help us gain more time, and he describes how, as we grow older, subjective time accelerates as routine increases; a fulfilled and varied life is a long life. Evidence shows that bodily processes&#8211;especially the heartbeat&#8211;underlie our feeling of time and act as an internal clock for our sense of time. And Wittmann points to recent research that connects time to consciousness; ongoing studies of time consciousness, he tells us, will help us to understand the conscious self.</p>

<p>                    The instant Sunday Times Top Ten and New York Times bestseller<br />
                    Shortlisted for the Financial Times/McKinsey Business Book of the Year Award<br />

<p>                    A powerful argument for how to succeed in any field: develop broad interests and skills while everyone around you is rushing to specialize.     </p>
<p>                    From the &#8216;10,000 hours rule&#8217; to the power of Tiger parenting, we have been taught that success in any field requires early specialization and many hours of deliberate practice. And, worse, that if you dabble or delay, you&#8217;ll never catch up with those who got a head start.     </p>
<p>                    This is completely wrong.    </p>
<p>                    In this landmark book, David Epstein shows you that the way to succeed is by sampling widely, gaining a breadth of experiences, taking detours, experimenting relentlessly, juggling many interests &#8211; in other words, by developing range.    </p>
<p>                    Studying the world&#8217;s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors and scientists, Epstein demonstrates why in most fields &#8211; especially those that are complex and unpredictable &#8211; generalists, not specialists are primed to excel. No matter what you do, where you are in life, whether you are a teacher, student, scientist, business analyst, parent, job hunter, retiree, you will see the world differently after you&#8217;ve read Range. You&#8217;ll understand better how we solve problems, how we learn and how we succeed. You&#8217;ll see why failing a test is the best way to learn and why frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers.     </p>
<p>                    As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, Range shows how people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive and why spreading your knowledge across multiple domains is the key to your success, and how to achieve it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved Range&#8217; &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.&#8217; &#8211; Daniel H. Pink    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;So much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education.&#8217; &#8211; Susan Cain, bestselling author of Quiet</p>

<p>                    Debunks the idea that aging inevitably brings infirmity and unhappiness and instead offers a trove of practical, evidence-based guidance for living longer and better.<br />
                    &#8211;Daniel H. Pink, author of When and Drive     </p>
<p>                    SUCCESSFUL AGING delivers powerful insights:<br />
                     &#8211; Debunking the myth that memory always declines with age<br />
                     &#8211; Confirming that health span&#8211;not life span&#8211;is what matters<br />
                     &#8211; Proving that sixty-plus years is a unique and newly recognized developmental stage<br />
                     &#8211; Recommending that people look forward to joy, as reminiscing doesn&#8217;t promote health     </p>
<p>                     Levitin looks at the science behind what we all can learn from those who age joyously, as well as how to adapt our culture to take full advantage of older people&#8217;s wisdom and experience. Throughout his exploration of what aging really means, using research from developmental neuroscience and the psychology of individual differences, Levitin reveals resilience strategies and practical, cognitive- enhancing tricks everyone should do as they age.     </p>
<p>                     Successful Aging inspires a powerful new approach to how readers think about our final decades, and it will revolutionize the way we plan for old age as individuals, family members, and citizens within a society where the average life expectancy continues to rise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; &#8220;Unfair succinctly and persuasively recounts cutting-edge research testifying to the faulty and inaccurate procedures that underpin virtually all aspects of our criminal justice system, illustrating many with case studies.&#8221;&#8211;The Boston Globe    </p>
<p>                     A child is gunned down by a police officer; an investigator ignores critical clues in a case; an innocent man confesses to a crime he did not commit; a jury acquits a killer. The evidence is all around us: Our system of justice is fundamentally broken.     </p>
<p>                     But it&#8217;s not for the reasons we tend to think, as law professor Adam Benforado argues in this eye-opening, galvanizing book. Even if the system operated exactly as it was designed to, we would still end up with wrongful convictions, trampled rights, and unequal treatment. This is because the roots of injustice lie not inside the dark hearts of racist police officers or dishonest prosecutors, but within the minds of each and every one of us.     </p>
<p>                     This is difficult to accept. Our nation is founded on the idea that the law is impartial, that legal cases are won or lost on the basis of evidence, careful reasoning and nuanced argument. But they may, in fact, turn on the camera angle of a defendant&#8217;s taped confession, the number of photos in a mug shot book, or a simple word choice during a cross-examination. In Unfair, Benforado shines a light on this troubling new field of research, showing, for example, that people with certain facial features receive longer sentences and that judges are far more likely to grant parole first thing in the morning.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last two decades, psychologists and neuroscientists have uncovered many cognitive forces that operate beyond our conscious awareness. Until we address these hidden biases head-on, Benforado argues, the social inequality we see now will only widen, as powerful players and institutions find ways to exploit the weaknesses of our legal system.     </p>
<p>                     Weaving together historical examples, scientific studies, and compelling court cases&#8211;from the border collie put on trial in Kentucky to the five teenagers who falsely confessed in the Central Park Jogger case&#8211;Benforado shows how our judicial processes fail to uphold our values and protect society&#8217;s weakest members. With clarity and passion, he lays out the scope of the legal system&#8217;s dysfunction and proposes a wealth of practical reforms that could prevent injustice and help us achieve true fairness and equality before the law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific and philosophical concepts can change the way we solve problems by helping us to think more effectively about our behavior and our world. Surprisingly, despite their utility, many of these tools remain unknown to most of us.     </p>
<p>                    In Mindware, the world-renowned psychologist Richard E. Nisbett presents these ideas in clear and accessible detail, offering a tool kit for better thinking and wiser decisions. He has made a distinguished career of studying and teaching such powerful problem-solving concepts as the law of large numbers, statistical regression, cost-benefit analysis, sunk costs and opportunity costs, and causation and correlation, probing how best to teach others to use them effectively in their daily lives. In this groundbreaking book, he shows that a course in a given field&#8211;statistics or economics, for example&#8211;often doesn&#8217;t work as well as a few minutes of more practical instruction in analyzing everyday situations. Mindware shows how to reframe common problems in such a way that these powerful scientific and statistical concepts can be applied to them. The result is an enlightening and practical guide to the most powerful tools of reasoning ever developed&#8211;tools that can easily be used to make better professional, business, and personal decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;With deft prose and page after page of keen insights, Heffernan shows why we close our eyes to facts that threaten our families, our livelihood, and our self-image&#8211;and, even better, she points the way out of the darkness.&#8221; &#8211;Daniel H. Pink  In the tradition of Malcolm Gladwell and Nassim Nicholas Taleb, Margaret Heffernan&#8217;s Willful Blindness is a tour de force on human behavior that will open your eyes. Why, after every major accident and blunder, do we look back and say, How could we have been so blind? Why do some people see what others don&#8217;t? And how can we change? Drawing on studies by psychologists and neuroscientists, and from interviews with business leaders, whistleblowers, and white collar criminals, distinguished businesswoman and writer Margaret Heffernan examines the phenomenon of willful blindness, exploring the reasons that individuals and groups are blind to impending personal tragedies, corporate collapses, engineering failures-even crimes against humanity. We turn a blind eye in order to feel safe, to avoid conflict, to reduce anxiety, and to protect prestige. But greater understanding leads to solutions, and Heffernan shows how-by challenging our biases, encouraging debate, discouraging conformity, and not backing away from difficult or complicated problems-we can be more mindful of what&#8217;s going on around us and be proactive instead of reactive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Learn how to make real, lasting changes in your life    </p>
<p>                    We all have bad habits &#8211; whether it&#8217;s a weakness for junk food, a smartphone addiction or a lack of exercise. But change is hard. Forty percent of dieters quit within a week. Eighty percent of New Year&#8217;s resolutions don&#8217;t last beyond January. How can we kick bad habits &#8211; and stick with it?    </p>
<p>                    According to psychologist and behaviour researcher Dr Sean Young, the answer is to stop trying to change the person, and instead change the process. In Stick With It, Dr Young draws on his own research and that of other leading experts to explain how the mind often interferes with breaking bad habits, and how we can outsmart it, increasing the likelihood of lasting change by 200%.     </p>
<p>                    Packed with practical exercises and real-life case studies, Stick With It shows that it is possible to control spending, stick to a diet, exercise regularly and overcome problem behaviours &#8211; forever.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Scientifically grounded and personally implementable. It&#8217;s a winner&#8217; &#8211; Robert Cialdini, author of Influence and Pre-Suasion    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A must-read for anyone who&#8217;s been unable to keep a New Year&#8217;s resolution or failed at making a lasting change in any other area of their life or work. &#8211; Jonah Berger, author of Contagious    </p>
<p>                    Dr Sean Young is one of the world&#8217;s leading experts in the field of habit-forming. He is an acclaiedpsychologist and the founder and Executive Director of the UCLA Center for Digital Behavior. His research involves the study of cutting-edge ways of using social media and mobile technologies to change and predict human behaviour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The author of the bestselling You Are Not So Smart gives readers a fighting chance at outsmarting their not-so-smart brains.      </p>
<p>                    A mix of popular psychology and trivia, You Are Now Less Dumb is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality&#8211;except we&#8217;re not. But that&#8217;s okay, because our delusions keep us sane.     </p>
<p>                    Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of seventeen ways we fool ourselves every day, including:<br />
                    Enclothed Cognition (the clothes you wear change your behavior and influence your mental abilities)The Benjamin Franklin Effect (how you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate the people you harm).Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality)The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater effect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us)Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don&#8217;t enjoy just to make the time or money already invested &#8220;worth it&#8221;)McRaney also reveals the true price of happiness, and how to avoid falling for our own lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER &#8211; NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY THE ECONOMIST      </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The most important book on decision making since Daniel Kahneman&#8217;s Thinking, Fast and Slow.&#8221;&#8211;Jason Zweig, The Wall Street Journal     </p>
<p>                     Everyone would benefit from seeing further into the future, whether buying stocks, crafting policy, launching a new product, or simply planning the week&#8217;s meals. Unfortunately, people tend to be terrible forecasters. As Wharton professor Philip Tetlock showed in a landmark 2005 study, even experts&#8217; predictions are only slightly better than chance. However, an important and underreported conclusion of that study was that some experts do have real foresight, and Tetlock has spent the past decade trying to figure out why. What makes some people so good? And can this talent be taught?     </p>
<p>                     In Superforecasting, Tetlock and coauthor Dan Gardner offer a masterwork on prediction, drawing on decades of research and the results of a massive, government-funded forecasting tournament. The Good Judgment Project involves tens of thousands of ordinary people&#8211;including a Brooklyn filmmaker, a retired pipe installer, and a former ballroom dancer&#8211;who set out to forecast global events. Some of the volunteers have turned out to be astonishingly good. They&#8217;ve beaten other benchmarks, competitors, and prediction markets. They&#8217;ve even beaten the collective judgment of intelligence analysts with access to classified information. They are superforecasters.     </p>
<p>                     In this groundbreaking and accessible book, Tetlock and Gardner show us how we can learn from this elite group. Weaving together stories of forecasting successes (the raid on Osama bin Laden&#8217;s compound) and failures (the Bay of Pigs) and interviews with a range of high-level decision makers, from David Petraeus to Robert Rubin, they show that good forecasting doesn&#8217;t require powerful computers or arcane methods. It involves gathering evidence from a variety of sources, thinking probabilistically, working in teams, keeping score, and being willing to admit error and change course.     </p>
<p>                    Superforecasting offers the first demonstrably effective way to improve our ability to predict the future&#8211;whether in business, finance, politics, international affairs, or daily life&#8211;and is destined to become a modern classic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#038;ldquoKenrick writes like a dream.&#8221;- Robert Sapolsky, Professor of Biology and Neurology, Stanford University author of  A Primate&#8217;s Memoir  and  Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers  What do sex and murder have to do with the meaning of life? Everything. In  Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life , social psychologist Douglas Kenrick exposes the selfish animalistic underside of human nature, and shows how it is intimately connected to our greatest and most selfless achievements. Masterfully integrating cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and complexity theory, this intriguing book paints a comprehensive picture of the principles that govern our lives. As Kenrick divulges, beneath our civilized veneer, human beings are a lot like howling hyenas and barking baboons, with heads full of homicidal tendencies and sexual fantasies. But, in his view, many ingrained, apparently irrational behaviours- such as inclinations to one-night stands, racial prejudices, and conspicuous consumption- ultimately manifest what he calls&#8221;Deep Rationality.&#8221;  Although our heads are full of simple selfish biases that evolved to help our ancestors survive, modern human beings are anything but simple and selfish cavemen. Kenrick argues that simple and selfish mental mechanisms we inherited from our ancestors ultimately give rise to the multifaceted social lives that we humans lead today, and to the most positive features of humanity, including generosity, artistic creativity, love, and familial bonds. And out of those simple mechanisms emerge all the complexities of society, including international conflicts and global economic markets. By exploring the nuance of social psychology and the surprising results of his own research, Kenrick offers a detailed picture of what makes us caring, creative, and complex- that is, fully human.   Illuminated with stories from Kenrick&#8217;s own colourful experiences &#8211;  from his criminally inclined shantytown Irish relatives, his own multiple high school expulsions, broken marriages, and homicidal fantasies, to his eventual success as an evolutionary psychologist and loving father of two boys separated by 26 years &#8211;  this book is an exploration of our mental biases and failures, and our mind&#8217;s great successes. Idiosyncratic, controversial, and fascinating,  Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life  uncovers the pitfalls and promise of our biological inheritance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This wide-ranging course reveals the method to our madness in everything from finances to Friday the 13th. An expert on irrational behavior, Professor Vyse discusses what it means to be rational before delving into the many reasoning errors and psychological challenges that lead us astray. In fifteen lectures, he will teach you to identify the logical fallacies and quirks of our psychology that tempt us to make unwise decisions. While the course is based in theory, it&#8217;s also teeming with practical advice. You&#8217;ll examine several popular conspiracy theories before exploring the remarkable staying power of common &#8220;bad luck&#8221; superstitions: How did these superstitions come to be? Is it always bad to be irrational? At what point do our beliefs veer into the territory of wishful thinking or willful ignorance? Packed with fun examples and everyday pointers, this course will leave you thinking long and hard about how you think. With Professor Vyse&#8217;s guidance, you&#8217;ll learn to better understand your beliefs and make better decisions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;There is an enemy. There is an intelligent, active, malign force working against us. Step one is to recognize this. This recognition alone is enormously powerful. It saved my life, and it will save yours.&#8221; &#8212; Steven Pressfield Could you be getting in your way of producing great work? Have you started a project but never finished? Would you like to do work that matters, but don&#8217;t know where to start?The answer is Do the Work, a manifesto by bestselling author Steven Pressfield, that will show you that it&#8217;s not about better ideas, it&#8217;s about actually doing the work. Do the Work is a weapon against Resistance &#8211; a tool that will help you take action and successfully ship projects out the door. Picking up where The War of Art and Turning Pro left off, Do The Work takes the reader from the start to the finish of any long-form project-novel, screenplay, album, software piece, you name it. Do The Work identifies the predictable Resistance Points along the way and walks you through each of them. No, you are not crazy. No, you are not alone. No, you are not the first person to &#8220;hit the wall&#8221; in Act Two. Do The Work charts the territory. It&#8217;s the stage-by-stage road map for taking your project from Page One to THE END.</p>
