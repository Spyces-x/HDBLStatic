										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Finally: an engaging, evidence-based book about how to battle biases, champion diversity and inclusion, and advocate for those who lack power and privilege. Dolly Chugh makes a convincing case that being an ally isn&#8217;t about being a good person-it&#8217;s about constantly striving to be a better person.&#8221;  -Adam Grant, New York Times bestselling author of Give and Take, Originals, and Option B with Sheryl Sandberg    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Laszlo Bock, the bestselling author of Work Rules! and former Senior Vice President of People Operations at Google    </p>
<p>                    An inspiring guide from Dolly Chugh, an award-winning social psychologist at the New York University Stern School of Business, on how to confront difficult issues including sexism, racism, inequality, and injustice so that you can make the world (and yourself) better.    </p>
<p>                    Many of us believe in equality, diversity, and inclusion. But how do we stand up for those values in our turbulent world? The Person You Mean to Be is the smart, &#8220;semi-bold&#8221; person&#8217;s guide to fighting for what you believe in.    </p>
<p>                    Dolly reveals the surprising causes of inequality, grounded in the &#8220;psychology of good people&#8221;. Using her research findings in unconscious bias as well as work across psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and other disciplines, she offers practical tools to respectfully and effectively talk politics with family, to be a better colleague to people who don&#8217;t look like you, and to avoid being a well-intentioned barrier to equality. Being the person we mean to be starts with a look at ourselves.    </p>
<p>                    She argues that the only way to be on the right side of history is to be a good-ish- rather than good-person. Good-ish people are always growing. Second, she helps you find your &#8220;ordinary privilege&#8221;-the part of your everyday identity you take for granted, such as race for a white person, sexual orientation for a straight person, gender for a man, or education for a college graduate. This part of your identity may bring blind spots, but it is your best tool for influencing change. Third, Dolly introduces the psychological reasons that make it hard for us to see the bias in and around us. She leads you from willful ignorance to willful awareness. Finally, she guides you on how, when, and whom, to engage (and not engage) in your workplaces, homes, and communities. Her science-based approach is a method any of us can put to use in all parts of our life.    </p>
<p>                    Whether you are a long-time activist or new to the fight, you can start from where you are. Through the compelling stories Dolly shares and the surprising science she reports, Dolly guides each of us closer to being the person we mean to be.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ben Horowitz, a leading venture capitalist, modern management expert, and New York Times bestselling author combines lessons both from history and modern organisational practice with practical and often surprising advice to help us build cultures that can weather both good and bad times.    </p>
<p>                              The times and circumstances in which people were raised often shape them &#8211; yet a few leaders have managed to shape their times. In this follow-up to the bestselling business classic The Hard Thing About Hard Things, Ben Horowitz turns his attention to a question crucial to every organisation: How do you create and sustain the culture you want?     </p>
<p>                              This book is a journey through cultures ancient to modern, spotlighting models of leadership and culture-building from the samurai to prison gangs. Along the way, it answers fundamental questions: Who are we? How do people talk about us when we&#8217;re not around? How do we treat our customers? Can we be trusted?     </p>
<p>                              Because who you are is not the values you list on the wall. It&#8217;s not what you say in a company-wide meeting. It&#8217;s not your marketing campaign. It&#8217;s not even what you believe. Who you are is what you do. This book will help you do the things needed to become the kind of leader you want to be &#8211; and others want to follow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Behavioral economist and New York Times bestselling author of Predictably Irrational Dan Ariely returns to offer a much-needed take on the irrational decisions that influence our dating lives, our workplace experiences, and our general behaviour, up close and personal.    </p>
<p>                              In The Upside of Irrationality, behavioral economist Dan Ariely will explore the many ways in which our behaviour often leads us astray in terms of our romantic relationships, our experiences in the workplace, and our temptations to cheat. Blending everyday experience with groundbreaking research, Ariely explains how expectations, emotions, social norms and other invisible, seemingly illogical forces skew our reasoning abilities.    </p>
<p>                              Among the topics Dan explores are:<br />
                    * What we think will make us happy and what really makes us happy;<br />
                    * How we learn to love the ones we are with;<br />
                    * Why online dating doesn&#8217;t work, and how we can improve on it;<br />
                    * Why learning more about people make us like them less;<br />
                    * Why large bonuses can make CEOs less productive;<br />
                    * How to really motivate people at work;<br />
                    * Why bad directions can help us;<br />
                    * How we fall in love with our ideas;<br />
                    * How we are motivated by revenge; and<br />
                    * What motivates us to cheat.    </p>
<p>                              Drawing on the same experimental methods that made Predictably Irrational such a hit, Dan will emphasize the important role that irrationality plays in our day-to-day decisionmaking-not just in our financial marketplace, but in the most hidden aspects of our lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally! The book that helps you deal with irrational, impossible people. &#8211; Oprah&#8217;s Book Club 2.0 Let&#8217;s face it: we all know people who are downright irrational. No matter how hard you try to reason with them, it never works. So what&#8217;s the solution? How do you talk to someone who just won&#8217;t listen? What can you do with an unrealistic boss, an angry spouse, or an overly emotional friend? You can&#8217;t win by ignoring the insanity-and you can&#8217;t argue it away. But you can stop it cold. Top-ranked psychiatrist and communication expert Mark Goulston shows you how in Talking to Crazy, a life-changing book for everyone trapped in maddening personal or professional relationships. Goulston unlocks the mysteries of the irrational mind, and explains how faulty thinking patterns develop. His keen insights are matched by a set of counterintuitive strategies proven to defuse crazy behavior, along with scripts, examples, and exercises that teach you how to use them. You&#8217;ll learn: Why people act the way they do * How instinctive responses can exacerbate the situation-and what to do instead * When to confront a problem and when to walk away * How to activate the Sanity Cycle-which quickly transforms you from threat to ally * How to use 14 simple, but effective communication techniques, including assertive submission flattery, the kiss-off, and more * And much more You can&#8217;t reason with unreasonable people-but you can reach them. This powerful and practical book shows you how.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>History is filled with many examples of successful introvert-extrovert partnerships. Bestselling author Jennifer Kahnweiler offers a five-step process that will enable introverts and extroverts to work together harmoniously and achieve more than they ever could on their own. The key, Kahnweiler says, is to remember that these relationships are most successful when opposites stop emphasizing their differences and use approaches that focus them both on moving toward results. This first-of-its-kind practical guide helps introverts and extroverts understand and appreciate each other&#8217;s wiring. Kahnweiler shows you how to perform the delicate balancing act required to create a whole that is exponentially greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Our brains were designed for tribal life, for getting along with a select group of others (Us), and for fighting off everyone else (Them). But modern life has thrust the world&#8217;s tribes into a shared space, creating conflicts of interest and clashes of values, along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we can find our common ground.    </p>
<p>                    A grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, Moral Tribes reveals the underlying causes of modern conflict and lights a way forward. Our emotions make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions make us fight, sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words, and often with life-and-death stakes. Drawing inspiration from moral philosophy and cutting-edge science, Moral Tribes shows when we should trust our instincts, when we should reason, and how the right kind of reasoning can move us forward.    </p>
<p>                    Joshua Greene is the director of Harvard University&#8217;s Moral Cognition Lab, a pioneering scientist, a philosopher, and an acclaimed teacher. The great challenge of Moral Tribes is this: How can we get along with Them when what they want feels so wrong? Finally, Greene offers a surprisingly simple set of maxims for navigating the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving problems and living better lives.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The Art of Asking is a book about cultivating trust and getting as close as possible to love, vulnerability, and connection. Uncomfortably close. Dangerously close. Beautifully close&#8217; Brene Brown    </p>
<p>                    Imagine standing on a box in the middle of a busy city, dressed as a white-faced bride, and silently using your eyes to ask people for money. Or touring Europe in a punk cabaret band, and finding a place to sleep each night by reaching out to strangers on Twitter. For Amanda Palmer, actions like these have gone beyond satisfying her basic needs for food and shelter &#8211; they&#8217;ve taught her how to turn strangers into friends, build communities, and discover her own giving impulses. And because she had learned how to ask, she was able to go to the world to ask for the money to make a new album and tour with it, and to raise over a million dollars in a month.    </p>
<p>                    In the New York TImes bestseller The Art of Asking, Palmer expands upon her popular TED talk to reveal how ordinary people, those of us without thousands of Twitter followers and adoring fans, can use these same principles in our own lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This worldwide bestseller offers simple guidance for building the kind of open and trusting relationships vital for tackling global systemic challenges and developing adaptive, innovative organizations&#8211;over 200,000 copies sold and translated into seventeen languages!     </p>
<p>                    We live, say Edgar and Peter Schein, in a culture of &#8220;tell.&#8221; All too often we tell others what we think they need to know or should do. But whether we are leading or following, what matters most is we get to the truth. We have to develop a commitment to sharing vital facts and identifying faulty assumptions&#8211;it can mean the difference between success and failure. This is why we need Humble Inquiry more than ever.     </p>
<p>                    The Scheins define Humble Inquiry as &#8220;the gentle art of drawing someone out, of asking questions to which you do not know the answer, of building relationships based on curiosity and interest in the other person.&#8221; It was inspired by Edgar&#8217;s twenty years of work in high-hazard industries and the health-care system, where honest communication can literally mean the difference between life and death.     </p>
<p>                    In this new edition the authors look at how Humble Inquiry differs from other kinds of inquiry, offer examples of it in action, and show how to overcome the barriers that keep us telling when we should be asking. This edition offers a deepening and broadening of this concept, seeing it as not just a way of posing questions but an entire attitude that includes better listening, better responding to what others are trying to tell us, and better revealing of ourselves. Packed with case examples and a full chapter of exercises and simulations, this is a major contribution to how we see human conversational dynamics and relationships, presented in a compact, personal, and eminently practical way.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We spend much of our days talking. Yet we know little about the conversational engine that drives our everyday lives. We are pushed and pulled around by language far more than we realize, yet are seduced by stereotypes and myths about communication.    </p>
<p>                    This book will change the way you think about talk. It will explain the big pay-offs to understanding conversation scientifically.     </p>
<p>                    Elizabeth Stokoe, a social psychologist, has spent over twenty years collecting and analysing real conversations across settings as varied as first dates, crisis negotiation, sales encounters and medical communication. This book describes some of the findings of her own research, and that of other conversation analysts around the world.     </p>
<p>                    Through numerous examples from real interactions between friends, partners, colleagues, police officers, mediators, doctors and many others, you will learn that some of what you think you know about talk is wrong. But you will also uncover fresh insights about how to have better conversations &#8211; using the evidence from fifty years of research about the science of talk.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When did humans begin to kiss? Why is kissing integral to some cultures and alien to others? Do good kissers make the best lovers? And is that expensive lip-plumping gloss worth it? Sheril Kirshenbaum, a marine biologist and science journalist, tackles these questions and more in THE SCIENCE OF KISSING. It&#8217;s everything you always wanted to know about kissing but either haven&#8217;t asked, can&#8217;t find out, or didn&#8217;t realize you should understand. Sheril&#8217;s a serious scientist, and the material here is informed by the results of the latest studies and theories, but she&#8217;s also got an engaging, delightful voice and offers information with a light, humorous touch. Topics range from the kind of kissing men like to do (as distinct from women), to what animals can teach us about the kiss, to whether or not the true art of kissing was lost sometime in the Dark Ages, to what, really, makes us kiss. Employing an interdisciplinary approach&#8211;drawing upon classical history, evolutionary biology, psychology, popular culture, and more&#8211;Kirshenbaum&#8217;s winning book will appeal to romantics and armchair scientists alike.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From Jon Ronson, the Sunday Times top ten bestselling author of The Psychopath Test, this is a captivating and brilliant exploration of one of our world&#8217;s most underappreciated forces: shame.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;It&#8217;s about the terror, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of what?&#8217; I said.<br />
                    &#8216;The terror of being found out.&#8217;    </p>
<p>                    Jon Ronson has travelled the world meeting recipients of high-profile public shamings. The shamed are people like us &#8211; people who, say, made a joke on social media that came out badly, or made a mistake at work. Once their transgression is revealed, collective outrage circles with the force of a hurricane and the next thing they know they&#8217;re being torn apart by an angry mob, jeered at, demonized, sometimes even fired from their job.    </p>
<p>                    A great renaissance of public shaming is sweeping our land. Justice has been democratized. The silent majority are getting a voice. But what are we doing with our voice? We are mercilessly finding people&#8217;s faults. We are defining the boundaries of normality by ruining the lives of those outside it. We are using shame as a form of social control.    </p>
<p>                    Simultaneously powerful and hilarious in the way only Jon Ronson can be, So You&#8217;ve Been Publicly Shamed is a deeply honest book about modern life, full of eye-opening truths about the escalating war on human flaws &#8211; and the very scary part we all play in it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cynicism often seems a smarter choice than idealism, and there are seemingly good reasons for this. Politicians have disappointed us time and again, trusted institutions have proven silf-serving and corrupt, and social inequities persist and increase, unabated by even the grandest of charitable efforts. Moreover, trends in contemporrary moral psychology support this bleak view of the human condition. Famous studies have shown that we have an almost unlimited<br />
                    potential for cruelty when placed in the wrong situations. Other studies imply that our moral responses are dictated by inborn biological intuitions, or that people do little more than act out conventional cultural scripts when confronted with moral chices.    </p>
<p>                    The Power of Ideals presents a different vision, supported by a different kind of evidence. It examines the lives and work of six 20th century moral leaders who pursued moral causes ranging from world peace to social justice and human rights. Using these six cases to illustrate how people can make choices guided by their moral convictions, rather than by base emotion or social pressures, authors William Damon and Anne Colby explore the workings of three virtues: inner truthfulness,<br />
                    humility, and faith. Through their portrayal of the noble lives of moral leaders, the authors argue that everyone -including those of us   with ordinary lives &#8211; can exercise control over important life decisions and pursue ideals that inspire us. The Power of Ideals offers a hopeful and much-needed vision for<br />
                    moral progress in the worl.    </p>
<p>                    This message flies in the face of contemporary thought in moral psychology, much of which has drawn  mainstream media coverage in recent years. But the more accurate, constructive, and inspiring view in The Power of Ideals provides a sound basis for helping all people achieve their moral potentials. The Power of Ideals offers a needed and hopeful vision for personal well-being, for rebuilding trust among disillusioned citizens, for the flourishing of democracy, and for moral<br />
                    progress in the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;[Dr. Malkin&#8217;s] reassuring tone and plethora of case histories offer considered advice and generous encouragement.&#8221; &#8212; Kirkus Reviews    </p>
<p>                    When most of us hear the word narcissism or narcissist, we envision vain, preening, braggarts who can&#8217;t stop talking about themselves. But most of the time, we&#8217;ve got it wrong; many narcissists aren&#8217;t driven by looks, fame, or money&#8211;some may even be shy or soft spoken. The startling truth is we&#8217;ve been distracted by an empty stereotype that blinds us to far more reliable signs of danger&#8211;and an entire generation is suffering because of it.     </p>
<p>                    In Rethinking Narcissism Harvard Medical School psychologist Craig Malkin addresses the narcissism epidemic by illuminating the spectrum of narcissism, identifying ways to control the trait, and explaining how too little of it may be a bad thing. Readers will learn that there&#8217;s far more to narcissism than its reductive invective would imply. The reality is that we all fall somewhere between utter selflessness and grandiosity. A healthy middle&#8211;a healthy degree of narcissism&#8211;is essential for a strong sense of self. Malkin deconstructs our misconceptions of narcissism and offers clear, step-by-step guidance on how to protect ourselves and how to promote healthy narcissism in our partners, our children, and ourselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Warren Buffett compares stock trading to great athletes: they excel not because of fast neurological responses, but because of their ability to delay as long as possible before reacting. Successful CEOs, fire fighters, and military officers all know how to manage delay to gather as much information as possible to get the results they need.    </p>
<p>                    In Wait, Frank Partnoy argues that decisions of all kinds, whether &#8216;snap&#8217; or long-term, benefit from being made at the last possible moment. The art of knowing how long you can afford to delay before committing is at the heart of many a great decision, whether in a corporate takeover or a marriage proposal. Apologies are better received if they are not rushed and people who can defer gratification are happier and more successful than those who must have everything now. Partnoy demonstrates that the ability to wait is crucial to getting the right answer and that gut instincts are often wrong.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is commonplace that counselors, therapists, teachers, business leaders, executives, coaches, and other helping professionals &#8211; specifically trained in group leadership &#8211; often fail to apply their knowledge and skills to settings in which they might matter most. The same practitioners who guide others may not be able to put that background to work when they find themselves supervising peers, leading meetings, or even managing conflict at the dinner table. What<br />
                    You Don&#8217;t Know about Leadership, but Probably Should discusses ways that leadership skills and interventions can operate throughout daily life. Applications from group therapy and systemic intervention models will be applied to the realities that people face every day &#8211; inspiring others, facilitating<br />
                    meetings, running social events, guiding conversations, and empowering others. This text uniquely integrates the latest research, theory, concepts, and skills into a model that applies these ideas to every aspect of daily life. The author draws not only from the extensive literature in group dynamics, counseling, and psychology, but also includes insights from business leaders gleaned from over a dozen interviews he conducted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Why do we get so embarrassed when a colleague wears the same shirt? Why do we eat the same thing for breakfast every day, but seek out novelty at lunch and dinner? How has streaming changed the way Netflix makes recommendations? Why do people think the music of their youth is the best? How can you spot a fake review on Yelp?     </p>
<p>                     Our preferences and opinions are constantly being shaped by countless forces &#8211; especially in the digital age with its nonstop procession of &#8220;thumbs up&#8221; and &#8220;likes&#8221; and &#8220;stars.&#8221; Tom Vanderbilt, bestselling author of Traffic, explains why we like the things we like, why we hate the things we hate, and what all this tell us about ourselves.     </p>
<p>                     With a voracious curiosity, Vanderbilt stalks the elusive beast of taste, probing research in psychology, marketing, and neuroscience to answer myriad complex and fascinating questions. If you&#8217;ve ever wondered how Netflix recommends movies or why books often see a sudden decline in Amazon ratings after they win a major prize, Tom Vanderbilt has answers to these questions and many more that you&#8217;ve probably never thought to ask.</p>

<p>                    Former Olympian and best-selling author Matthew Syed is one of the advisors Gareth Southgate engaged from outside football in order to find new ways of working as a team. In Rebel Ideas, discover how Southgate &#8216;the man with the plan&#8217; replaced 50 years of hurt with two major tournament semi-finals in three years.&#8217;     </p>
<p>                    Matthew Syed&#8217;s phenomenal bestseller will change the way you think about success &#8211; for ever.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Syed is a superb storyteller. I couldn&#8217;t put the book down, and I learned so much. A stunning achievement&#8217; Tim Harford, author of The Undercover Economist    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas examines the power of &#8216;cognitive diversity&#8217; &#8211; the ability to think differently about the world around us.    </p>
<p>                    It explains how to harness our unique perspectives, pool our collective intelligence and tackle the greatest challenges of our age &#8211; from climate change to terrorism. It draws on a dazzling range of case studies, including the catastrophic failings of the CIA before 9/11, a fatal communication breakdown on top of Mount Everest and a moving tale of deradicalisation in America&#8217;s Deep South.    </p>
<p>                    Rebel Ideas will strengthen any team or organisation, but has dozens of individual applications, too: from the art of reinvention to the remarkable benefits of personalised nutrition. It shows us how to become more creative, how to collaborate in a world becoming more interconnected, and how to break free of echo chambers that surround us all.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Teens today are forty percent less empathetic than they were thirty years ago. Why is a lack of empathy-which goes hand-in-hand with the self-absorption epidemic Dr. Michele Borba calls the Selfie Syndrome-so dangerous? First, it hurts kids&#8217; academic performance and leads to bullying behaviours. Also, it correlates with more cheating and less resilience. And once children grow up, a lack of empathy hampers their ability to collaborate, innovate and problem-solve-all must-have skills for the global economy.<br />
                         In UnSelfie Dr. Borba pinpoints the forces causing the empathy crisis and shares a revolutionary, researched-based, nine-step plan for reversing it. Empathy is a trait that can be taught and nurtured. Dr. Borba offers a framework for parenting that yields the results we all want: successful, happy kids who also are kind, moral, courageous, and resilient. UnSelfie is a blueprint for parents and educators who want to kids shift their focus from I, me, and mine&#8230;to we, us, and ours.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes, it makes more sense to lose today in order to win tomorrow. What do you do when you know what you want, but you have no idea how to get it?    </p>
<p>                     &#8216;The greatest negotiation book of all time.&#8217; Inc. Magazine<br />
                     ________________                           </p>
<p>                     Never walk away. Learn to listen, then learn to understand, then learn to win.    </p>
<p>                    Negotiation is part of every human encounter, and most of us do it badly. Whether dealing with family, a business, or diplomacy, people often fail to meet their goals in every country and context. They focus on power and &#8220;win-win&#8221; instead of relationships and perceptions. They don&#8217;t find enough things to trade. They think others should be rational when they should be dealing with emotions. They get distracted from their goals.    </p>
<p>                    In this revolutionary and seminal bestselling book, leading negotiation practitioner, coach and professor Stuart Diamond shows how emotional intelligence, perceptions, cultural diversity and collaboration produce four times as much value as old-school, conflictive, power, leverage and logic. Drawing on thirty-plus years of research involving 30,000 people across 45 countries &#8211; ranging from political and corporate leaders to administrative assistants, lawyers, housewives, students, and labourers &#8211; he outlines specific, practical and better ways to deal with others. To this, he adds his 40-year experience as a corporate executive, Harvard-trained attorney, and Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.    </p>
<p>                    Getting More is based on Professor Diamond&#8217;s award-winning negotiations course at The Wharton Business School, where it has been the most sought-after course by students for almost two decades. It contains a powerful toolkit that can be used in any situation: with kids and jobs, travel and shopping, business, politics, relationships, cultures, partners and competitors. His advice is brought to life in an accessible and entertaining manner through the stories of hundreds of people who have used the toolkit with great success.<br />

<p>                     &#8216;From advising on how to negotiate with terrorists, to industrial disputes, to children, Diamond&#8217;s twelve rules of negotiation promise to open new doors every day.&#8217; Radio One    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A first class book&#8217; Sunday Times    </p>
<p>                    We&#8217;re all conspiracy theorists. Some of us just hide it better than others.    </p>
<p>                    Conspiracy theorists do not wear tin-foil hats (for the most part). They are not just a few kooks lurking on the paranoid fringes of society with bizarre ideas about shape-shifting reptilian aliens running society in secret. They walk among us. They are us.    </p>
<p>                    Everyone loves a good conspiracy. Yet conspiracy theories are not a recent invention. And they are not always a harmless curiosity. In Suspicious Minds, Rob Brotherton explores the history and consequences of conspiracism, and delves into the research that offers insights into why so many of us are drawn to implausible, unproven and unproveable conspiracy theories. They resonate with some of our brain&#8217;s built-in quirks and foibles, and tap into some of our deepest desires, fears, and assumptions about the world.     </p>
<p>                    The fascinating and often surprising psychology of conspiracy theories tells us a lot &#8211; not just why we are drawn to theories about sinister schemes, but about how our minds are wired and, indeed, why we believe anything at all. Conspiracy theories are not some psychological aberration &#8211; they&#8217;re a predictable product of how brains work. This book will tell you why, and what it means.    </p>
<p>                    Of course, just because your brain&#8217;s biased doesn&#8217;t always mean you&#8217;re wrong. Sometimes conspiracies are real. Sometimes, paranoia is prudent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the 100 best behavioural economic books of all time recommended by Jeff Bezos, Tim Ferriss, Satya Nadella, Brian Tracy and Erik Brynjolfsson.    </p>
<p>                     The Olympics. X-Factor. The Rich List. The Nobel Prize. Everywhere you look: competition &#8211; for fame, money, attention, status. Being top seems to be everything &#8211; but what is it costing all of us?    </p>
<p>                     We depend on competition and expect it to identify the best, make complicated decisions easy and to motivate the lazy and inspire the dreamers. But, as Margaret Heffernan shows in this eye-opening look at competition, competition regularly produces just what we don&#8217;t want: rising levels of fraud, cheating, stress, inequality and political stalemate. Siblings won&#8217;t speak to each other. Children burn out at school. Doping proliferates among athletes. Auditors and fund managers go to jail for insider trading. Winners seem to take all while the desire to win consumes all, inciting panic and despair.    </p>
<p>                     We now know that competition often doesn&#8217;t work, that the best do not always rise to the top and the so-called efficiency of competition creates a great deal of waste. So what are our alternatives? What are the skills needed for creative collaboration and how do we hone them?    </p>
<p>                     Talking to scientists, musicians, athletes, entrepreneurs and executives, in the follow-up to her bestselling Wilful Blindness, Margaret Heffernan has discovered that, around the world, individuals and organizations are finding creative, cooperative ways to work that don&#8217;t pit people against each other but support them in their desire to work together. While the rest of the world remains mired in pitiless sniping, racing to the bottom, the future belongs to the people and companies who have learned that they are greater working together than against one another. Some call that soft but it&#8217;s harder than anything they&#8217;ve done before. They are the real winners, sharing a bigger prize.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A surprising and entertaining explanation of how the words we use (even the ones we don&#8217;t notice) reveal our personalities, emotions, and identities.     </p>
<p>                    In The Secret Life of Pronouns, social psychologist and language expert James W. Pennebaker uses his groundbreaking research in computational linguistics-in essence, counting the frequency of words we use-to show that our language carries secrets about our feelings, our self-concept, and our social intelligence. Our most forgettable words, such as pronouns and prepositions, can be the most revealing: their patterns are as distinctive as fingerprints.     </p>
<p>                    Using innovative analytic techniques, Pennebaker X-rays everything from John McCain&#8217;s tweets to the Federalist Papers. Who would have predicted that the high school student who uses too many verbs in her college admissions essay is likely to make lower grades in college? Or that a world leader&#8217;s use of pronouns could reliably presage whether he will lead his country into war? You&#8217;ll learn what Lady Gaga and William Butler Yeats have in common, and how Ebenezer Scrooge&#8217;s syntax hints at his self-deception and repressed emotion in this sprightly, surprising tour of what our words are saying-whether we mean them to or not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The human mind is both brilliant and pathetic. We have mastered fire and have stood on the moon, and yet every one of us is fundamentally ignorant, irrational and prone to making simple mistakes every day.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;In The Knowledge Illusion, the cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach hammer another nail into the coffin of the rational individual . . . positing that not just rationality but the very idea of individual thinking is a myth.&#8217;<br />
                    Yuval Harari, bestselling author of Sapiens and Homo Deus    </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking book, cognitive scientists Steven Sloman and Philip Fernbach show how our success as a species is down to us living in a rich community of knowledge where we are drawing on information and expertise outside our heads. And we have no idea that we are even doing it.    </p>
<p>                    Utilizing cutting-edge research, The Knowledge Illusion explains why we think we know more than we do, why beliefs are so hard to change and why we are so prone to making mistakes. Providing a blueprint for successful ways to work in collaboration to do amazing things, it reveals why the key to human intelligence lies in the way we think and work together.</p>

<p>                    As a human behaviour investigator, Vanessa Van Edwards studies the hidden forces that drive our behaviour patterns in her lab &#8211; and she&#8217;s cracked the code.     </p>
<p>                    In Captivate she shares a wealth of shortcuts, systems and behaviour hacks derived from her research, to help you take charge of interactions at work and at home. You&#8217;ll learn how to execute a social game plan to navigate any social situation; how to speed-read faces for 7 universal &#8216;micro-expressions&#8217; that can be used to predict people&#8217;s emotions; and much more besides.     </p>
<p>                    When you understand the laws of human behaviour you can get along with anyone. With Vanessa&#8217;s help, you will never interact in the same way again.</p>

<p>                    The Starbucks publicity stunt that spectacularly backfired.    </p>
<p>                    The mix-up at the 2017 Oscars ceremony.    </p>
<p>                    As technology rapidly advances, it brings with it an explosion of complexity that can trip us up. Meltdown uses real-life examples to reveal how errors in thinking, perception, and design lie behind both our everyday mistakes and our most terrifying disasters. It reveals how a five-minute exercise can prevent billion-dollar catastrophes, why teams with fewer experts are better at managing risk, and why diversity is one of our best safeguards against failure. This eye-opening book will change the way you see our complex world &#8211; and your place within it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Essential reading.&#8217; &#8211; Martin Ford, bestselling author of Rise of the Robots</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ve been so wowed by a new author&#8221;<br />
                    -Chip Health, co-author of The Power of Moments and Switch A talented journalist reveals the hidden patterns behind what we call &#8220;luck&#8221; &#8212; and shows us how we can all improve outcomes despite life&#8217;s inevitable randomness. &#8220;Do you believe in luck?&#8221; is a polarizing question, one you might ask on a first date. Some of us believe that we make our own luck. Others see inequality everywhere and think that everyone&#8217;s fate is at the whim of the cosmos. Karla Starr has a third answer: unlucky, &#8220;random&#8221; outcomes have predictable effects on our behavior that often make us act in self-defeating ways without even realizing it.  In this groundbreaking book, Starr traces wealth, health, and happiness back to subconscious neurological processes, blind cultural assumptions, and tiny details you&#8217;re in the habit of overlooking. Each chapter reveals how we can cultivate personal strengths to overcome life&#8217;s unlucky patterns. For instance: &#8211; Everyone has free access to that magic productivity app&#8211;motivation. The problem? It isn&#8217;t evenly distributed. What lucky accidents of history explain patterns behind why certain groups of people are more motivated in some situations than others? &#8211; If you look like an underperforming employee, your resume can&#8217;t override the gut-level assumptions that a potential boss will make from your LinkedIn photo. How can we make sure that someone&#8217;s first impression is favorable? &#8211; Just as people use irrelevant traits to make assumptions about your intelligence, kindness, and trustworthiness, we also make inaccurate snap judgments. How do these judgments affect our interactions, and what should we assume about others to maximize our odds of having lucky encounters?  We don&#8217;t always realize when the world&#8217;s invisible biases work to our advantage or recognize how much of a role we play in our own lack of luck. By ending the guessing game about how luck works, Starr allows you to improve your fortunes while expending minimal effort.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Priya Parker has created both an art and a science to gathering in ways that can bring joy and fulfilment to any meeting&#8217; Deepak Chopra     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Hosts of all kinds, this is a must-read!&#8217; Chris Anderson, creator of TED    </p>
<p>                    &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;     </p>
<p>                    Being deprived of gathering has revealed just how important it is to us; to connect with others, collaborate, share ideas and create moving, life-affirming experiences.    </p>
<p>                    At a time when coming together is more crucial than ever, Priya Parker sets forth a human-centered approach to gathering that can help everyone create meaningful, memorable experiences in their lives, large and small, for work and for play.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on her wide expertise as a facilitator of high-powered gatherings around the world, Parker takes us inside events of all kinds to show what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and why. She investigates a wide array of gatherings &#8211; a court hearing, a flash-mob party, an Arab-Israeli summer camp &#8211; and explains how simple changes can invigorate any group experience. The result is a book full of exciting ideas of real-world applications and one that will forever alter the way you look at your next business meeting, dinner party and garden barbecue.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE SUNDAY TIMES TOP TEN BESTSELLER    </p>
<p>                    From one of our greatest voices in modern philosophy, author of The Course of Love, The Consolations of Philosophy, Religion for Atheists and The School of Life &#8211; Alain de Botton sets out to understand our universal fear of failure &#8211; and how we might change it    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;De Botton&#8217;s gift is to prompt us to think about how we live and how we might change things&#8217;  The Times     </p>
<p>                    We all worry about what others think of us. We all long to succeed and fear failure. We all suffer &#8211; to a greater or lesser degree, usually privately and with embarrassment &#8211; from status anxiety.     </p>
<p>                    Alain de Botton gives a name to this universal condition and sets out to investigate both its origins and possible solutions. He looks at history, philosophy, economics, art and politics &#8211; and reveals the many ingenious ways that great minds have overcome their worries. The result is a book that is not only entertaining and thought-provoking &#8211; but genuinely wise and helpful as well.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;He analyses modern society with great charm, learning and humour. His remedies come as a welcome relief when most books offering solutions to the stresses of life recommend the lotus position&#8217; Daily Mail</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • The instant classic about why some ideas thrive, why others die, and how to make your ideas stick.    </p>
<p>                    “Anyone interested in influencing others—to buy, to vote, to learn, to diet, to give to charity or to start a revolution—can learn from this book.”—The Washington Post<br />
                      <br />
                     Mark Twain once observed, “A lie can get halfway around the world before the truth can even get its boots on.” His observation rings true: Urban legends, conspiracy theories, and bogus news stories circulate effortlessly. Meanwhile, people with important ideas—entrepreneurs, teachers, politicians, and journalists—struggle to make them “stick.”     </p>
<p>                     In Made to Stick, Chip and Dan Heath reveal the anatomy of ideas that stick and explain ways to make ideas stickier, such as applying the human scale principle, using the Velcro Theory of Memory, and creating curiosity gaps. Along the way, we discover that sticky messages of all kinds—from the infamous “kidney theft ring” hoax to a coach’s lessons on sportsmanship to a vision for a new product at Sony—draw their power from the same six traits.    </p>
<p>                     Made to Stick will transform the way you communicate. It’s a fast-paced tour of success stories (and failures): the Nobel Prize-winning scientist who drank a glass of bacteria to prove a point about stomach ulcers; the charities who make use of the Mother Teresa Effect; the elementary-school teacher whose simulation actually prevented racial prejudice.<br />
                      <br />
                     Provocative, eye-opening, and often surprisingly funny, Made to Stick shows us the vital principles of winning ideas—and tells us how we can apply these rules to making our own messages stick.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When BIC, manufacturer of disposable ballpoint pens, wanted to grow, it looked for an idea beyond introducing new sizes and ink colors. Someone suggested lighters.     </p>
<p>                     LIGHTERS?     </p>
<p>                     With an idea that seemed crazy at first, that bright executive, instead of seeing BIC as a pen company&#8211;a business in the PEN &#8220;box&#8221;&#8211;figured out that there was growth to be found in the DISPOSABLE &#8220;box.&#8221; And he was right. Now there are disposable BIC lighters, razors, even phones. The company opened its door to a host of opportunities.     </p>
<p>                     IT INVENTED A NEW BOX.     </p>
<p>                     Your business can, too. And simply thinking &#8220;out of the box&#8221; is not the answer. True ingenuity needs structure, hard analysis, and bold brainstorming. It needs to start     </p>
<p>                     THINKING IN NEW BOXES    </p>
<p>                     &#8211;a revolutionary process for sustainable creativity from two strategic innovation experts from The Boston Consulting Group (BCG).     </p>
<p>                     To make sense of the world, we all rely on assumptions, on models&#8211;on what Luc de Brabandere and Alan Iny call &#8220;boxes.&#8221; If we are unaware of our boxes, they can blind us to risks and opportunities.     </p>
<p>                     This innovative book challenges everything you thought you knew about business creativity by breaking creativity down into five steps:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Doubt everything. Challenge your current perspectives.<br />
                     &#8211; Probe the possible. Explore options around you.<br />
                     &#8211; Diverge. Generate many new and exciting ideas, even if they seem absurd.<br />
                     &#8211; Converge. Evaluate and select the ideas that will drive breakthrough results.<br />
                     &#8211; Reevaluate. Relentlessly. No idea is a good idea forever. And did we mention Reevaluate? Relentlessly.     </p>
<p>                     Creativity is paramount if you are to thrive in a time of accelerating change. Replete with practical and potent creativity tools, and featuring fascinating case studies from BIC to Ford to Trader Joe&#8217;s, Thinking in New Boxes will help you and your company overcome missed opportunities and stay ahead of the curve.     </p>
<p>                     This book isn&#8217;t a simpleminded checklist. This is Thinking in New Boxes.     </p>
<p>                     And it will be fun. (We promise.)     </p>
<p>                    Praise for Thinking in New Boxes     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Excellent . . . While focusing on business creativity, the principles in this book apply anywhere change is needed and will be of interest to anyone seeking to reinvent herself.&#8221;&#8211;Blogcritics     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Thinking in New Boxes is a five-step guide that leverages the authors&#8217; deep understanding of human nature to enable readers to overcome their limitations and both imagine and create their own futures. This book is a must-read for people living and working in today&#8217;s competitive environment.&#8221;&#8211;Ray O. Johnson, Ph.D., chief technology officer, Lockheed Martin     </p>

<p>                    Much of the advice we&#8217;ve been told about achievement is logical, earnest&#8230;and downright wrong. In Barking Up the Wrong Tree, Eric Barker reveals the extraordinary science behind what actually determines success and most importantly, how anyone can achieve it. You&#8217;ll learn:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Why valedictorians rarely become millionaires, and how your biggest weakness might actually be your greatest strength<br />
                    &#8211; Whether nice guys finish last and why the best lessons about cooperation come from gang members, pirates, and serial killers    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Why trying to increase confidence fails and how Buddhist philosophy holds a superior solution<br />
                    &#8211; The secret ingredient to &#8220;grit&#8221; that Navy SEALs and disaster survivors leverage to keep going<br />
                    &#8211; How to find work-life balance using the strategy of Genghis Khan, the errors of Albert Einstein, and a little lesson from Spider-Man    </p>
<p>                    By looking at what separates the extremely successful from the rest of us, we learn what we can do to be more like them-and find out in some cases why it&#8217;s good that we aren&#8217;t. Barking Up the Wrong Tree draws on startling statistics and surprising anecdotes to help you understand what works and what doesn&#8217;t so you can stop guessing at success and start living the life you want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A Financial Times Book of the Month pick for April! Is it worth swimming in shark-infested waters to surf a 50-foot, career-record wave? Is it riskier to make an action movie or a horror movie? Should sex workers forfeit 50 percent of their income for added security or take a chance and keep the extra money? Most people wouldn&#8217;t expect an economist to have an answer to these questions&#8211;or to other questions of daily life, such as who to date or how early to leave for the airport. But those people haven&#8217;t met Allison Schrager, an economist and award-winning journalist who has spent her career examining how people manage risk in their lives and careers. Whether we realize it or not, we all take risks large and small every day. Even the most cautious among us cannot opt out&#8211;the question is always which risks to take, not whether to take them at all. What most of us don&#8217;t know is how to measure those risks and maximize the chances of getting what we want out of life. In An Economist Walks into a Brothel,  Schrager equips readers with five principles for dealing with risk, principles used by some of the world&#8217;s most interesting risk takers. For instance, she interviews a professional poker player about how to stay rational when the stakes are high, a paparazzo in Manhattan about how to spot different kinds of risk, horse breeders in Kentucky about how to diversify risk and minimize losses, and a war general who led troops in Iraq about how to prepare for what we don&#8217;t see coming. When you start to look at risky decisions through Schrager&#8217;s new framework, you can increase the upside to any situation and better mitigate the downside.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Americans create 57% of the world&#8217;s advertising while representing only 6% of its population; half of our waking hours are spent immersed in the mass media. Persuasion has always been integral to the democratic process, but increasingly, thoughtful discussion is being replaced with simplistic soundbites and manipulative messages.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the history of propaganda as well as on contemporary research in social psychology, Age of Propaganda shows how the tactics used by political campaigners, sales agents, advertisers, televangelists, demagogues, and others often take advantage of our emotions by appealing to our deepest fears and most irrational hopes, creating a distorted vision of the world we live in.     </p>
<p>                    This revised and updated edition includes coverage of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal, recent election campaigns, talk radio, teen suicide, U.F.O. abductions, the Columbine shootings, and novel propaganda tactics based on hypocrisy and false allegations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>But sound has surprising power to influence our decisions, opinions, and actions in ways we might not even notice. Discordant ambient noise can induce anxiety; ice cream truck jingles can bring you back to your childhood. In The Sonic Boom, strategic sound consultant Joel Beckerman provides a new framework for thinking about sound effects on every aspect of our lives. You don&#8217;t need to be a musician or a composer to harness the power of sound. Whether you&#8217;re a corporate giant connecting with millions of customers or a teacher connecting with one classroom of students, the key to an effective sonic strategy is the creation of &#8220;boom moments&#8221; transcendent instants when sound connects with a listener&#8217;s emotional core.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever wondered why a trumpeter of family values would suddenly turn around and cheat on his wife? Why jealousy would send an otherwise level-headed person into a violent rage? What could drive a person to blow a family fortune at the blackjack tables?     </p>
<p>                    Or have you ever pondered what might make Mr. Right leave his beloved at the altar, why hypocrisy seems to be rampant, or even why, every once in awhile, even you are secretly tempted, to lie, cheat, or steal (or, conversely, help someone you never even met)?     </p>
<p>                    This book answers these questions and more, and in doing so, turns the prevailing wisdom about who we are upside down. Our character, argue psychologists DeSteno and Valdesolo, isn&#8217;t a stable set of traits, but rather a shifting state that is subject to the constant push and pull of hidden mechanisms in our mind. And it&#8217;s the battle between these dueling psychological forces that determine how we act at any given point in time.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing on the surprising results of the clever experiments concocted in their own laboratory, DeSteno and Valdesolo shed new scientific light on so many of the puzzling behaviors that regularly grace the headlines. For example, you&#8217;ll learn:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Why Tiger Woods just couldn&#8217;t resist the allure of his mistresses even though he had a picture-perfect family at home. And why no one, including those who knew him best, ever saw it coming.     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Why even the shrewdest of investors can be tempted to gamble their fortunes away (and why risky financial behavior is driven by the same mechanisms that compel us to root for the underdog in sports).     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Why Eliot Spitzer, who made a career of crusading against prostitution, turned out to be one of the most famous johns of all time.     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Why Mel Gibson, a noted philanthropist and devout Catholic, has been repeatedly caught spewing racist rants, even though close friends say he doesn&#8217;t have a racist bone in his body.     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; And why any of us is capable of doing the same, whether we believe it or not!    </p>
<p>                    A surprising look at the hidden forces driving the saint and sinner lurking in us all, Out of Character reveals why human behavior is so much more unpredictable than we ever realized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wall Street Journal bestseller  An expert on the psychology of leadership and the bestselling author of Integrity, Necessary Endings, and Boundaries For Leaders identifies the critical ingredient for personal and professional wellbeing.  Most leadership coaching focuses on helping leaders build their skills and knowledge and close performance gaps. These are necessary, but not sufficient. Using evidence from neuroscience and his work with leaders, Dr. Henry Cloud shows that the best performers draw on another vital resource: personal and professional relationships that fuel growth and help them surpass current limits.  Popular wisdom suggests that we should not allow others to have power over us, but the reality is that they do, for better or for worse. Consider the boss who diminishes you through cutting remarks versus one who challenges you to get better. Or the colleague who always seeks the limelight versus the one who gives you the confidence to finish a difficult project. Or the spouse who is honest and supportive versus the one who resents your success.<br />
                    No matter how talented, intelligent, or experienced, the greatest leaders share one commonality: the power of the others in their lives.  Combining engaging case studies, persuasive findings from cutting-edge brain research, and examples from his consulting practice, Dr. Cloud argues that whether you&#8217;re a Navy SEAL or a corporate executive, outstanding performance depends on having the right kind of connections to fuel personal growth and minimize toxic associations and their effects. Presenting a dynamic model of the impact these different kinds of connections produce, Dr. Cloud shows readers how to get more from themselves by drawing on the strength and expertise of others. You don&#8217;t have a choice whether or not others have power in your life, but you can choose what kinds of relationships you want.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As it was in Anna Karenina, Madame Bovary, and Othello, so it is in life. Most forms of private vice and public evil are kindled and sustained by lies. Acts of adultery and other personal betrayals, financial fraud, government corruption&#8211;even murder and genocide&#8211;generally require an additional moral defect: a willingness to lie.  In Lying, best-selling author and neuroscientist Sam Harris argues that we can radically simplify our lives and improve society by merely telling the truth in situations where others often lie. He focuses on &#8220;white&#8221; lies&#8211;those lies we tell for the purpose of sparing people discomfort&#8211;for these are the lies that most often tempt us. And they tend to be the only lies that good people tell while imagining that they are being good in the process.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;One of the most important books of our modern era&#8221; -Amb. Jaime de Bourbon    </p>
<p>                    For anyone struggling with conflict, this book can transform you. Negotiating the Nonnegotiable takes you on a journey into the heart and soul of conflict, providing unique insight into the emotional undercurrents that too often sweep us out to sea. With vivid stories of his closed-door sessions with warring political groups, disputing businesspeople, and families in crisis, Daniel Shapiro presents a universally applicable method to successfully navigate conflict.  A deep, provocative book to reflect on and wrestle with, this book can change your life.    </p>
<p>                     Be warned: This book is not a quick fix. Real change takes work. You will learn how to master five emotional dynamics that can sabotage conflict outside your awareness:    </p>
<p>                    1. Vertigo: How can you avoid      getting emotionally consumed in conflict?<br />
                    2. Repetition compulsion: How can you stop      repeating the same conflicts again and again?<br />
                    3. Taboos: How can you discuss      sensitive issues at the heart of the conflict?<br />
                    4. Assault on the sacred: What should you do if      your values feel threatened?<br />
                    5. Identity politics: What can you do if      others use politics against you?     </p>
<p>                    In our era of discontent, this is just the book we need to resolve conflict in our own lives and in the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Creator and host of the podcast The Gratitude Diaries and New York Times bestselling author Janice Kaplan examines the phenomenon of luck&#8211;and discovers the exciting ways you can grab opportunities and make luck for yourself every day.  After spending a year researching and experiencing gratitude for The Gratitude Diaries, Janice Kaplan is back to tackle another big, mysterious influence in all our lives: luck. And this time she&#8217;s joined on her journey by coauthor Dr. Barnaby Marsh, a renowned academic who guides her exploration. Together they uncover the unexpected, little-understood science behind what we call luck, proving that many seemingly random events are actually under your&#8211;and everyone&#8217;s&#8211;control. They examine the factors that made stars like Harrison Ford and Jonathan Groff so successful, and learn the real secrets that made Kate Spade and Warby Parker into global brands. Using original research, fascinating studies, and engaging interviews, Kaplan and Marsh reveal the simple techniques to create luck in love and marriage, business and career, and health, happiness, and family relationships. Their breakthrough insights prove that all of us&#8211;from CEOs to stay-at-home moms&#8211;can tip the scales of fortune in our favor. Through a mix of scientific research, conversations with famous and successful people&#8211;from academics like Dan Ariely and Leonard Mlodinow to actor Josh Groban&#8211;and powerful narrative, How Luck Happens uncovers a fascinating subject in accessible and entertaining style.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A timely and important new book that challenges everything we think we know about cultivating true belonging in our communities, organizations, and culture, from the #1 bestselling author of Rising Strong, Daring Greatly, and The Gifts of Imperfection.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;True belonging doesn&#8217;t require us to change who we are. It requires us to be who we are.&#8217;  Social scientist Brene Brown, PhD, LMSW has sparked a global conversation about the experiences that bring meaning to our lives &#8211; experiences of courage, vulnerability, love, belonging, shame and empathy. In Braving the Wilderness, Brown redefines what it means to truly belong in an age of increased polarisation. With her trademark mix of research, storytelling and honesty, Brown will again change the cultural conversation while mapping out a clear path to true belonging.    </p>
<p>                    Brown argues that what we&#8217;re experiencing today is a spiritual crisis of disconnection, and introduces four practices of true belonging that challenge everything we believe about ourselves and each other. She writes, &#8216;True belonging requires us to believe in and belong to ourselves so fully that we can find sacredness both in both being a part of something, and in standing alone when necessary. But in a culture that&#8217;s rife with perfectionism and pleasing, and with the erosion of civility, it&#8217;s easy to stay quiet, hide in our ideological bunkers, or fit in rather than show up as our true selves and brave the wilderness of uncertainty and criticism. But true belonging is not something we negotiate or accomplish with others; it&#8217;s a daily practice that demands integrity and authenticity. It&#8217;s a personal commitment that we carry in our hearts.&#8217; Brown offers us the clarity and courage we need to find our way back to ourselves and to each other. And that path cuts right through the wilderness. Brown writes, &#8216;The wilderness is an untamed, unpredictable place of solitude and searching. It is a place as dangerous as it is breathtaking, a place as sought after as it is feared. But it turns out to be the place of true belonging, and it&#8217;s the bravest and most sacred place you will ever stand.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the dramatic story of how a noted tech venture capitalist, an early mentor to Mark Zuckerberg and investor in his company, woke up to the serious damage Facebook was doing to our society and set out to try to stop it.    </p>
<p>                              If you had told Roger McNamee three years ago that he would soon be devoting himself to stopping Facebook from destroying democracy, he would have howled with laughter. He had mentored many tech leaders in his illustrious career as an investor, but few things had made him prouder, or been better for his fund&#8217;s bottom line, than his early service to Mark Zuckerberg. Still a large shareholder in Facebook, he had every good reason to stay on the bright side. Until he simply couldn&#8217;t.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is McNamee&#8217;s intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head of one of the world&#8217;s most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing. It&#8217;s a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author&#8217;s dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors. Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face.     </p>
<p>                              And then comes Brexit and the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has been put. To McNamee&#8217;s shock, Facebook&#8217;s leaders still duck and dissemble, viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travellers who share his concerns, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention economy more broadly &#8211; to our public health and to our political order.     </p>
<p>                              Zucked is both an enthralling personal narrative and a masterful explication of the forces that have conspired to place us all on the horns of this dilemma. This is the story of a company and its leadership, but it&#8217;s also a larger tale of a business sector unmoored from normal constraints, at a moment of political and cultural crisis, the worst possible time to be given new tools for summoning the darker angels of our nature and whipping them into a frenzy. This is a wise, hard-hitting, and urgently necessary account that crystallizes the issue definitively for the rest of us.</p>

When you consider what your boss is thinking or whether your spouse is happy, you are admitting them into the &#8220;mind club.&#8221; It&#8217;s easy to assume other humans can think and feel, but what about a cow, a computer, a corporation? What kinds of minds do they have?     </p>
<p>                    Daniel M. Wegner and Kurt Gray are award-winning psychologists who have discovered that minds&#8211;while incredibly important&#8211;are a matter of perception. Their research opens a trove of new findings, with insights into human behavior that are fascinating, frightening, and funny. The Mind Club explains why we love some animals and eat others, why people debate the existence of God so intensely, how good people can be so cruel, and why robots make such poor lovers. By investigating the mind perception of extraordinary targets&#8211;animals, machines, comatose people, God&#8211;Wegner and Gray explain what it means to have a mind and why it matters so much.     </p>
<p>                    Fusing cutting-edge research and personal anecdotes, The Mind Club explores the moral dimensions of mind perception with wit and compassion, revealing the surprisingly simple basis for what compels us to love and hate, to harm and to protect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Habits are more powerful than your will &#8211; if you know how to make them work for you    </p>
<p>                    Two strings are hanging from a ceiling, one at the centre of the room, one near the wall. You&#8217;re asked to tie the strings together, but you can&#8217;t reach both at the same time. You look around the room and see a table and a pair of pliers. How would you solve the problem?    </p>
<p>                    When confronted with challenges, most people let habits rule them (in this case, ignoring the pliers, the creative tool at your disposal). That is not surprising when you realise that at least a third of our waking hours are lived on auto-pilot &#8211; ruminating over past events, clicking through websites trawling for updates and the like. Such unconscious thoughts and actions are powerful. But the habits of the mind do not have to control us &#8211; we can steer them.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on hundreds of fascinating studies, psychologist Jeremy Dean &#8211; the mind behind the hugely popular and insightful website PsyBlog &#8211; shares how the new brain science of habit can be harnessed to your benefit, whether you&#8217;re hoping to eat moreveg, take an evening run, clear out your email backlog, or be more creative when faced with challenges at work and at home.</p>

<p>                     Winner of the 2013 PEN/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award     </p>
<p>                     Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world&#8211;our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment&#8211;is largely driven by the mind&#8217;s subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events&#8211;along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An illuminating look at the surprising upside of ambiguity&#8211;and how, properly harnessed, it can inspire learning, creativity, even empathy    </p>
<p>                     Life today feels more overwhelming and chaotic than ever. Whether it&#8217;s a confounding work problem or a faltering relationship or an unclear medical diagnosis, we face constant uncertainty. And we&#8217;re continually bombarded with information, much of it contradictory.     </p>
<p>                     Managing ambiguity&#8211;in our jobs, our relationships, and daily lives&#8211;is quickly becoming an essential skill. Yet most of us don&#8217;t know where to begin.     </p>
<p>                     As Jamie Holmes shows in Nonsense, being confused is unpleasant, so we tend to shutter our minds as we grasp for meaning and stability, especially in stressful circumstances. We&#8217;re hard-wired to resolve contradictions quickly and extinguish anomalies. This can be useful, of course. When a tiger is chasing you, you can&#8217;t be indecisive. But as Nonsense reveals, our need for closure has its own dangers. It makes us stick to our first answer, which is not always the best, and it makes us search for meaning in the wrong places. When we latch onto fast and easy truths, we lose a vital opportunity to learn something new, solve a hard problem, or see the world from another perspective.     </p>
<p>                     In other words, confusion&#8211;that uncomfortable mental place&#8211;has a hidden upside. We just need to know how to use it. This lively and original book points the way.     </p>
<p>                     Over the last few years, new insights from social psychology and cognitive science have deepened our understanding of the role of ambiguity in our lives and Holmes brings this research together for the first time, showing how we can use uncertainty to our advantage. Filled with illuminating stories&#8211;from spy games and doomsday cults to Absolut Vodka&#8217;s ad campaign and the creation of Mad Libs&#8211;Nonsense promises to transform the way we conduct business, educate our children, and make decisions.     </p>
<p>                     In an increasingly unpredictable, complex world, it turns out that what matters most isn&#8217;t IQ, willpower, or confidence in what we know. It&#8217;s how we deal with what we don&#8217;t understand.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bestselling author Dan Ariely reveals fascinating new insights into motivation&#8211;showing that the subject is far more complex than we ever imagined.     </p>
<p>                    Every day we work hard to motivate ourselves, the people we live with, the people who work for and do business with us. In this way, much of what we do can be defined as being &#8220;motivators.&#8221; From the boardroom to the living room, our role as motivators is complex, and the more we try to motivate partners and children, friends and coworkers, the clearer it becomes that the story of motivation is far more intricate and fascinating than we&#8217;ve assumed.     </p>
<p>                    Payoff investigates the true nature of motivation, our partial blindness to the way it works, and how we can bridge this gap. With studies that range from Intel to a kindergarten classroom, Ariely digs deep to find the root of motivation&#8211;how it works and how we can use this knowledge to approach important choices in our own lives. Along the way, he explores intriguing questions such as: Can giving employees bonuses harm productivity? Why is trust so crucial for successful motivation? What are our misconceptions about how to value our work? How does your sense of your mortality impact your motivation?</p>

<p>                    We are living in an age of heightened individualism. Success is a personal responsibility. Our culture tells us that to succeed is to be slim, rich, happy, extroverted, popular &#8211; flawless.    </p>
<p>                    The pressure to conform to this ideal has changed who we are. We have become self-obsessed. And our expectation of perfection comes at a cost. Millions are suffering under the torture of this impossible fantasy.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a divided world, empathy is not the solution, it is the problem.      </p>
<p>                    We think of empathy &#8211; the ability to feel the suffering of others for ourselves &#8211; as the ultimate source of all good behaviour. But while it inspires care and protection in personal relationships, it has the opposite effect in the wider world. As the latest research in psychology and neuroscience shows, we feel empathy most for those we find attractive and who seem similar to us and not at all for those who are different, distant or anonymous. Empathy therefore biases us in favour of individuals we know while numbing us to the plight of thousands. Guiding us expertly through the experiments, case studies and arguments on all sides, Paul Bloom ultimately shows that some of our worst decisions &#8211; in charity, child-raising, criminal justice, climate change and war &#8211; are motivated by this wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing.     </p>
<p>                    Brilliantly argued, urgent and humane, Against Empathy overturns widely held assumptions to reveal one of the most profound yet overlooked sources of human conflict.</p>

<p>                    Most of us pick control and predictability. Yet research reveals a counterintuitive truth: surprise is the key that unlocks growth, innovation, and connection. It is also the secret ingredient in our best memories.     </p>
<p>                    Through colorful narratives and compelling scientific findings, authors Tania Luna and Dr. LeeAnn Renninger shine a light on the world&#8217;s least understood and most intriguing emotion. They reveal how shifting our perception of surprise lets us thrive in the face of uncertainty. And they show us how surprise acts as a shortcut that turns a typical product into a meaningful experience, a good idea into a viral one, awkward small talk into engaging conversation, and daily life into an adventure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fifty years after the sexual revolution, we are told that we live in a time of unprecedented sexual freedom; that if anything, we are too free now. But beneath the veneer of glossy hedonism, millennial journalist Rachel Hills argues that we are controlled by a new brand of sexual convention: one which influences all of us-woman or man, straight or gay, liberal or conservative. At the root of this silent code lies the Sex Myth-the defining significance we invest in sexuality that once meant we were dirty if we didhave sex, and now means we are defective if we don&#8217;tdo it enough.     </p>
<p>                    Equal parts social commentary, pop culture, and powerful personal anecdotes from people across the English-speaking world, The Sex Mythexposes the invisible norms and unspoken assumptions that shape the way we think about sex today.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Cuts to the heart of who we are&#8217; Sunday Times<br />
                    &#8216;A book that begs discussion&#8217; Vanity Fair    </p>
<p>                    All Lina wanted was to be desired. How did she end up in a marriage with two children and a husband who wouldn&#8217;t touch her?    </p>
<p>                    All Maggie wanted was to be understood. How did she end up in a relationship with her teacher and then in court, a hated pariah in her small town?    </p>
<p>                    All Sloane wanted was to be admired. How did she end up a sexual object of men, including her husband, who liked to watch her have sex with other men and women?    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To Have Or to Be? is one of the seminal books of the second half of the 20th century. Nothing less than a manifesto for a new social and psychological revolution to save our threatened planet, this book is a summary of the penetrating thought of Eric Fromm. His thesis is that two modes of existence struggle for the spirit of humankind: the having mode, which concentrates on material possessions, power, and aggression, and is the basis of the universal evils of greed, envy, and violence; and the being mode, which is based on love, the pleasure of sharing, and in productive activity. To Have Or to Be? is a brilliant program for socioeconomic change.</p>

Whether it&#8217;s fear of commitment, insecurity, jealousy, or a tendency to be controlling, the real obstacle is a fundamental lack of trust&#8211;both in ourselves and in our partner.     </p>
<p>                    Daring to Trust offers key insights and practical exercises for exploring and addressing our trust issues in relationships. Topics include     </p>
<p>                    &#8211; How we learn early in life to trust others (or not to trust them)<br />
                     &#8211; Why we fear trusting<br />
                    &#8211; Developing greater trust in ourselves as the basis for trusting others<br />
                    &#8211; How to know if someone is trustworthy<br />
                    &#8211; Naive trust vs. healthy, adult trust<br />
                    &#8211; What to do when trust is broken     </p>
<p>                    Ultimately, Richo explains, we must develop trust in four directions: toward ourselves, toward others, toward life as it is, and toward a higher power or spiritual path. These four types of trust are not only the basis of healthy relationships, they are also the foundation of emotional well-being and freedom from fear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;The word &#8220;love&#8221; is most often defined as a noun, yet&#8230;we would all love better if we used it as a verb,&#8221; writes bell hooks as she comes out fighting and on fire in All About Love. Here, at her most provocative and intensely personal, the renowned scholar, cultural critic, and feminist skewers our view of love as romance. In its place she offers a proactive new ethic for a people and a society bereft with lovelessness.  As bell hooks uses her incisive mind and razor-sharp pen to explore the question &#8220;What is love?&#8221; her answers strike at both the mind and heart. In thirteen concise chapters, hooks examines her own search for emotional connection and society&#8217;s failure to provide a model for learning to love. Razing the cultural paradigm that the ideal love is infused with sex and desire, she provides a new path to love that is sacred, redemptive, and healing for the individuals and for a nation. The Utne Reader declared bell hooks one of the &#8220;100 Visionaries Who Can Change Your Life.&#8221; All About Love is a powerful affirmation of just how profoundly she can.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A touchstone for understanding how we behave on the job &#8220;This is a stimulating and provocative book in bringing together important ideas from different fields, and, thereby, giving us a whole new slant on &#8216;human nature. &#8216;&#8221; &#8211;Edgar H. Schein, Sloan Fellows Professor of Management Emeritus and Senior Lecturer, MIT In this astonishing, provocative, and solidly researched book, two Harvard Business School professors synthesize 200 years of thought along with the latest research drawn from the biological and social sciences to propose a new theory, a unified synthesis of human nature. Paul Lawrence and Nitin Nohria have studied the way people behave in that most fascinating arena of human behavior&#8211;the workplace&#8211;and from their work they produce a book that examines the four separate and distinct emotive drives that guide human behavior and influence the choices people make: the drives to acquire, bond, learn, and defend. They ultimately show that, just as advances in information technology have spurred the New Economy in the last quarter of the twentieth century, current advances in biology will be the key to understanding humans and organizations in the new millennium.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the tradition of The Sociopath Next Door, clinical psychologist Joseph Burgo&#8217;s The Narcissist You Know is a &#8220;clear, easily digestible&#8221; (Kirkus Reviews) guide to help you identify, disarm, and coexist with extreme narcissists.     </p>
<p>                    In today&#8217;s social media and selfie-obsessed culture, we are living in an age of narcissism&#8211;and a society that often celebrates this potentially harmful trait rather than understanding it as a psychological disorder. Scientists are beginning to learn that narcissism exists on a spectrum&#8211;much like autism&#8211;and most of us exhibit some mild narcissistic tendencies. But one in twenty people fall into a category the author refers to as Extreme Narcissism, in which these self-absorbed characteristics result in destructive behavior that harms not only the individual but everyone around them, including friends, family, and coworkers.     </p>
<p>                    With more than thirty years of experience studying personality disorders and treating extreme narcissists, Dr. Joseph Burgo has developed a useful guidebook to help you &#8220;spot narcissists out there in the wild&#8221; (Glamour) and then understand and manage the narcissistic personalities in your own life. Relying on detailed profiles, vignettes from the author&#8217;s practice, and celebrity biographies, The Narcissist You Know offers easy-to-understand tools and solutions you can use to defuse hostile situations and survive assaults on your self-esteem should you ever find yourself in an extreme narcissist&#8217;s orbit.</p>

<p>                    Why Are We Yelling is Buster Benson&#8217;s essential guide to having more honest and constructive arguments.    </p>
<p>                    The way we argue is broken. Whether it&#8217;s about Brexit, the existence of ghosts, the best burger in the city or who&#8217;s allowed to sit in your favourite chair, we end up digging our heels in and yelling at one another or choosing to avoid heated topics entirely. There has to be a better way.    </p>
<p>                    Buster Benson, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur with two decades of experience facilitating hard conversations at some of the biggest tech companies in the world, recommends eight things to try in order to make disagreements more productive. By applying these eight new habits, we can flip frustrating, unproductive disagreements into ones that bear fruit and bring people closer together.    </p>
<p>                    In this book you&#8217;ll master practical skills to make your disagreements more productive by:    </p>
<p>                    &#8211; Understanding four ways of disagreeing that are more valuable than simply &#8216;winning&#8217; the argument<br />
                    &#8211; Identifying the kind of argument you&#8217;re having so you know how best to negotiate it<br />
                    &#8211; Articulating the best possible version of your opponent&#8217;s argument before attacking it    </p>
<p>                    With this toolkit we can explore more possibilities and perspectives in the world, simply because we&#8217;ll no longer be afraid to wade into scary topics of conversation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past decade, governments and corporations have become increasingly interested in measuring the way people feel: &#8216;the Happiness index&#8217;, &#8216;Gross National Happiness&#8217;, &#8216;well-being&#8217; and positive psychology have come to dominate the way we live our lives. As a result, our emotions have become a new resource to be bought and sold. In a fascinating investigation combining history, science and ideas, William Davies shows how well-being influences all aspects of our lives: business, finance, marketing and smart technology. This book will make you rethink everything from the way you work, the power of the &#8216;Nudge&#8217;, the ever-expanding definitions of depression, and the commercialization of your most private feelings. The Happiness Industry is a shocking and brilliantly argued warning about the new religion of the age: our emotions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A practical guide to better communication that will break the blackmail cycle for good, by one of the nation&#8217;s leading therapists, Susan Forward.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Breathe a sigh of relief! Susan Forward helps you identify and correct an intensely destructive and confusing pattern of relating with those you love. I highly recommend this important book!&#8211;Susan Jeffers, Ph.D., author of Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway    </p>
<p>                    If you really loved me&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    After all I&#8217;ve done for you&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    How can you be so selfish&#8230;    </p>
<p>                    Do any of the above sound familiar? They&#8217;re all examples of emotional blackmail, a powerful form of manipulation in which people close to us threaten to punish us for not doing what they want. Emotional blackmailers know how much we value our relationships with them. They know our vulnerabilities and our deepest secrets. They are our mothers, our partners, our bosses and coworkers, our friends and our lovers. And no matter how much they care about us, they use this intimate knowledge to give themselves the payoff they want: our compliance.    </p>
<p>                    Susan Forward knows what pushes our hot buttons. Just as John Gray illuminates the communications gap between the sexes in Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus,  and Harriet Lerner describes an intricate dynamic in The Dance of Anger,  so Susan Forward presents the anatomy of a relationship damaged by manipulation, and gives readers an arsenal of tools to fight back.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window into Human Nature, Steven Pinker looks at how the relationship between words and thoughts can help us understand who we are.    </p>
<p>                      Why do so many swear words involve topics like sex, bodily functions or the divine? Why do some children&#8217;s names thrive while others fall out of favour? Why do we threaten and bribe and seduce in such elaborate, often comical ways? How can a choice of metaphor damn a politician or start a war? And why do we rarely say what we actually mean?     </p>
<p>                      Language, as Steven Pinker shows, is at the heart of our lives, and through the way we use it &#8211; whether to inform, persuade, entertain or manipulate &#8211; we can glimpse the very essence of what makes us human.     </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Awesome&#8217;<br />
                      Daily Mail    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Highly entertaining &#8230; funny and thought-provoking&#8217;<br />
                      The Times    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;Anyone interested in language should read The Stuff of Thought &#8230; moments of genuine revelation and some very good jokes&#8217;<br />
                      Mark Haddon, Sunday Telegraph Books of the Year    </p>
<p>                      &#8216;No one writes about language as clearly as Steven Pinker, and this is his best book yet&#8217;<br />
                      David Crystal, Financial Times    </p>
<p>                      Steven Pinker is the Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University. Until 2003, he taught in the Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT. He conducts research on language and cognition, writes for publications such as The New York Times, Time and Slate, and is the author of six books, including The Language Instinct, How the Mind Works and The Blank Slate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The struggle to understand the infant-parent bond ranks as one of the great quests of modern psychology, one that touches us deeply because it holds so many clues to how we become who we are. How are our personalities formed? How do our early struggles with our parents reappear in the way we relate to others as adults? Why do we repeat with our own children&#8211;seemingly against our will&#8211;the very behaviors we most disliked about our parents? In Becoming Attached, psychologist and noted journalist Robert Karen offers fresh insight into some of the most fundamental and fascinating questions of emotional life.<br />
                     Karen begins by tracing the history of attachment theory through the controversial work of John Bowlby, a British psychoanalyst, and Mary Ainsworth, an American developmental psychologist, who together launched a revolution in child psychology. Karen tells about their personal and professional struggles, their groundbreaking discoveries, and the recent flowering of attachment theory research in universities all over the world, making it one of the century&#8217;s most enduring ideas in developmental psychology.<br />
                     In a world of working parents and makeshift day care, the need to assess the impact of parenting styles and the bond between child and caregiver is more urgent than ever. Karen addresses such issues as: What do children need to feel that the world is a positive place and that they have value? Is day care harmful for children under one year? What experiences in infancy will enable a person to develop healthy relationships as an adult?, and he demonstrates how different approaches to mothering are associated with specific infant behaviors, such as clinginess, avoidance, or secure exploration. He shows how these patterns become ingrained and how they reveal themselves at age two, in the preschool years, in middle childhood, and in adulthood. And, with thought-provoking insights, he gives us a new understanding of how negative patterns and insecure attachment can be changed and resolved throughout a person&#8217;s life.<br />
                     The infant is in many ways a great mystery to us. Every one of us has been one; many of us have lived with or raised them. Becoming Attached is not just a voyage of discovery in child emotional development and its pertinence to adult life but a voyage of personal discovery as well, for it is impossible to read this book without reflecting on one&#8217;s own life as a child, a parent, and an intimate partner in love or marriage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A bold new theory of leadership drawn from elite captains throughout sports&#8211;named one of the best business books of the year by CNBC, The New York Times, Forbes, strategy+business, The Globe and Mail,  and Sports Illustrated     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;The book taught me that there&#8217;s no cookie-cutter way to lead. Leading is not just what Hollywood tells you. It&#8217;s not the big pregame speech. It&#8217;s how you carry yourself every day, how you treat the people around you, who you are as a person.&#8221;&#8211;Mitchell Trubisky, quarterback, Chicago Bears    </p>
<p>                    Now featuring analysis of the five-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots and their captain, Tom Brady     </p>
<p>                    The seventeen most dominant teams in sports history had one thing in common: Each employed the same type of captain&#8211;a singular leader with an unconventional set of skills and tendencies. Drawing on original interviews with athletes, general managers, coaches, and team-building experts, Sam Walker identifies the seven core qualities of the Captain Class&#8211;from extreme doggedness and emotional control to tactical aggression and the courage to stand apart. Told through riveting accounts of pressure-soaked moments in sports history, The Captain Class will challenge your assumptions of what inspired leadership looks like.     </p>
<p>                     Praise for The Captain Class     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;Wildly entertaining and thought-provoking . . . makes you reexamine long-held beliefs about leadership and the glue that binds winning teams together.&#8221;&#8211;Theo Epstein, president of baseball operations, Chicago Cubs     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;If you care about leadership, talent development, or the art of competition, you need to read this immediately.&#8221;&#8211;Daniel Coyle, author of The Culture Code     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;The insights in this book are tremendous.&#8221;&#8211;Bob Myers, general manager, Golden State Warriors     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;An awesome book . . . I find myself relating a lot to its portrayal of the out-of the-norm leader.&#8221;&#8211;Carli Lloyd, co-captain, U.S. Soccer Women&#8217;s National Team     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;A great read . . . Sam Walker used data and a systems approach to reach some original and unconventional conclusions about the kinds of leaders that foster enduring success. Most business and leadership books lapse into clichés. This one is fresh.&#8221;&#8211;Jeff Immelt, chairman and former CEO, General Electric      </p>
<p>                     &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you how much I loved The Captain Class. It identifies something many people who&#8217;ve been around successful teams have felt but were never able to articulate. It has deeply affected my thoughts around how we build our culture.&#8221;&#8211;Derek Falvey, chief baseball officer, Minnesota Twins</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE PHENOMENAL INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER: 1 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    Transform your life with tiny changes in behaviour, starting now.    </p>
<p>                    People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. But world-renowned habits expert James Clear has discovered another way. He knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions: doing two push-ups a day, waking up five minutes early, or holding a single short phone call.    </p>
<p>                    He calls them atomic habits.    </p>
<p>                    In this ground-breaking book, Clears reveals exactly how these minuscule changes can grow into such life-altering outcomes. He uncovers a handful of simple life hacks (the forgotten art of Habit Stacking, the unexpected power of the Two Minute Rule, or the trick to entering the Goldilocks Zone), and delves into cutting-edge psychology and neuroscience to explain why they matter. Along the way, he tells inspiring stories of Olympic gold medalists, leading CEOs, and distinguished scientists who have used the science of tiny habits to stay productive, motivated, and happy.     </p>
<p>                    These small changes will have a revolutionary effect on your career, your relationships, and your life.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An unprecedented history of the personality test conceived a century ago by a mother and her daughter&#8211;fiction writers with no formal training in psychology&#8211;and how it insinuated itself into our boardrooms, classrooms, and beyond. The basis for the HBO Max documentary, Persona    </p>
<p>                    The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is the most popular personality test in the world. It is used regularly by Fortune 500 companies, universities, hospitals, churches, and the military. Its language of personality types&#8211;extraversion and introversion, sensing and intuiting, thinking and feeling, judging and perceiving&#8211;has inspired television shows, online dating platforms, and Buzzfeed quizzes. Yet despite the test&#8217;s widespread adoption, experts in the field of psychometric testing, a $2 billion industry, have struggled to validate its results&#8211;no less account for its success. How did Myers-Briggs, a homegrown multiple choice questionnaire, infiltrate our workplaces, our relationships, our Internet, our lives?     </p>
<p>                    First conceived in the 1920s by the mother-daughter team of Katherine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers, a pair of devoted homemakers, novelists, and amateur psychoanalysts, Myers-Briggs was designed to bring the gospel of Carl Jung to the masses. But it would take on a life entirely its own, reaching from the smoke-filled boardrooms of mid-century New York to Berkeley, California, where it was administered to some of the twentieth century&#8217;s greatest creative minds. It would travel across the world to London, Zurich, Cape Town, Melbourne, and Tokyo, until it could be found just as easily in elementary schools, nunneries, and wellness retreats as in shadowy political consultancies and on social networks.     </p>
<p>                    Drawing from original reporting and never-before-published documents, The Personality Brokers takes a critical look at the personality indicator that became a cultural icon. Along the way it examines nothing less than the definition of the self&#8211;our attempts to grasp, categorize, and quantify our personalities. Surprising and absorbing, the book, like the test at its heart, considers the timeless question: What makes you, you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From the author of THE PERFECT STORM and WAR comes a book about why men miss war, why Londoners missed the Blitz, and what we can all learn from American Indian captives who refused to go home.    </p>
<p>                              Tribe is a look at post-traumatic stress disorder and the challenges veterans face returning to society. Using his background in anthropology, Sebastian Junger argues that the problem lies not with vets or with the trauma they&#8217;ve suffered, but with the society to which they are trying to return.    </p>
<p>                              One of the most puzzling things about veterans who experience PTSD is that the majority never even saw combat-and yet they feel deeply alienated and out of place back home. The reason may lie in our natural inclination, as a species, to live in groups of thirty to fifty people who are entirely reliant on one another for safety, comfort and a sense of meaning: in short, the life of a soldier.    </p>
<p>                              It is one of the ironies of the modern age that as affluence rises in a society, so do rates of suicide, depression and of course PTSD. In a wealthy society people don&#8217;t need to cooperate with one another, so they often lead much lonelier lives that lead to psychological distress. There is a way for modern society to reverse this trend, however, and studying how veterans react to coming home may provide a clue to how to do it. But it won&#8217;t be easy.</p>

<p>                    A powerful argument for how to succeed in any field: develop broad interests and skills while everyone around you is rushing to specialize.     </p>
<p>                    From the &#8216;10,000 hours rule&#8217; to the power of Tiger parenting, we have been taught that success in any field requires early specialization and many hours of deliberate practice. And, worse, that if you dabble or delay, you&#8217;ll never catch up with those who got a head start.     </p>
<p>                    This is completely wrong.    </p>
<p>                    In this landmark book, David Epstein shows you that the way to succeed is by sampling widely, gaining a breadth of experiences, taking detours, experimenting relentlessly, juggling many interests &#8211; in other words, by developing range.    </p>
<p>                    Studying the world&#8217;s most successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors and scientists, Epstein demonstrates why in most fields &#8211; especially those that are complex and unpredictable &#8211; generalists, not specialists are primed to excel. No matter what you do, where you are in life, whether you are a teacher, student, scientist, business analyst, parent, job hunter, retiree, you will see the world differently after you&#8217;ve read Range. You&#8217;ll understand better how we solve problems, how we learn and how we succeed. You&#8217;ll see why failing a test is the best way to learn and why frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers.     </p>
<p>                    As experts silo themselves further while computers master more of the skills once reserved for highly focused humans, Range shows how people who think broadly and embrace diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive and why spreading your knowledge across multiple domains is the key to your success, and how to achieve it.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;I loved Range&#8217; &#8211; Malcolm Gladwell    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Urgent and important. . . an essential read for bosses, parents, coaches, and anyone who cares about improving performance.&#8217; &#8211; Daniel H. Pink    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;So much crucial and revelatory information about performance, success, and education.&#8217; &#8211; Susan Cain, bestselling author of Quiet</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blending memoir, literary exposition, and revealing case studies, Unrequited is a powerful, surprising, and empathetic cultural and psychological exploration of one-sided romantic obsession.    </p>
<p>                    The summer Lisa A. Phillips turned thirty, she fell in love with someone who didn&#8217;t return her feelings. She soon became obsessed. She followed him around, called him compulsively, and talked about him endlessly. One desperate morning, after she snuck into his apartment building, he picked up a baseball bat to protect himself and began to dial 911. Her unrequited love had changed her from a sane, conscientious college teacher and radio reporter into someone she barely recognized&#8211;someone who was taking her yearning much too far.    </p>
<p>                    In Unrequited, Phillips explores the tremendous force of obsessive love in women&#8217;s lives. She argues that it needs to be understood, respected, and channeled for personal growth&#8211;yet it also has the potential to go terribly awry. Interweaving her own story with frank interviews and in-depth research in science, psychology, cultural history, and literature, Phillips describes how romantic obsession takes root, grows, and strongly influences our thoughts and behaviors.    </p>
<p>                    Going beyond images of creepy, fatally attracted psychos, male fantasies of unbridled female desire, and the platitudes of self-help books, Phillips reveals a powerful, troubling, and surprisingly common phenomenon. As she illuminates this mysterious psychological experience, placing it in a rich and nuanced context, she offers compelling insights to help any woman who has experienced unrequited obsessive love and been mystified and troubled by its grip.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re like most people, you think that your choices and behaviors are driven by your individual, personal tastes and opinions.<br />
                        You picked a jacket because you liked the way it looked. You picked a particular career because you found itinteresting. The notion that our choices are driven by our own personal thoughts and opinions seems so obvious that it is not even worth mentioning. Except that it&#8217;s wrong.<br />
                        Without our realizing it, other people&#8217;s behavior &#8211; what psychologists call &#8220;social influence&#8221; &#8211; has a huge influence on everything we do at every moment of our lives, from the mundane (which movie to see or place to have lunch) to the momentous (which career path to take or person to marry).<br />
                        We make riskier decisions because someone patted us on the shoulder. We like the name Mia because Madison and Sophia are popular names this year. Even strangers, or people we may never meet, have a startling impact on our judgments and decisions: our attitudes towards a welfare policy totally shift if we&#8217;re told it is supported by Democrats versus Republicans, even though the policy is the same in both cases.<br />
                        But social influence doesn&#8217;t just lead us to do the same things as others. Like a magnet it can attract, but it also can repel. In some cases we conform, or imitate others around us. But in other cases we diverge, or avoid particular choices or behaviors because other people are doing them. We stop listening to a band because they go mainstream. We skip buying the minivan because we don&#8217;t want to look like the soccer mom.<br />
                        By understanding how social influence works, we can decide when to resist and when to embrace it: we can affect others behavior and use others to help us make better-informed decisions.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;Macdonald zeros in on the slipperiness of factuality, offering an array of case studies from the worlds of history, commerce and &#8211; of course &#8211; politics.&#8217; New York Times     </p>
<p>                    True or false?  It&#8217;s rarely that simple.    </p>
<p>                    There is always more than one truth in every story.  Eating meat is nutritious but it&#8217;s also damaging to the environment.  The Internet disseminates knowledge but it also spreads hatred.  As communicators, we select the truths that are most useful to our agenda.    </p>
<p>                    We can select truths constructively to inspire nations, encourage children, and drive progressive change.  Or we can select truths that give a false impression of reality, misleading people without actually lying.  Others can do the same, motivating or deceiving us with the truth.      </p>
<p>                    In Truth, communications strategy expert Hector Macdonald explores how truth is used and abused in politics, business, the media and everyday life.   Combining great storytelling with practical takeaways and a litany of fascinating, funny and insightful case studies, Truth is a chilling and engaging read about how profoundly our mindsets and actions are influenced by the truths that those around us choose to tell.    </p>
<p>                    For fans of Factfulness, A Field Guide to Lies and Statistics and The Art of Thinking Clearly, a fascinating dive into the many ways in which &#8216;competing truths&#8217; shape our opinions, behaviours and beliefs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Scientific and philosophical concepts can change the way we solve problems by helping us to think more effectively about our behavior and our world. Surprisingly, despite their utility, many of these tools remain unknown to most of us.     </p>
<p>                    In Mindware, the world-renowned psychologist Richard E. Nisbett presents these ideas in clear and accessible detail, offering a tool kit for better thinking and wiser decisions. He has made a distinguished career of studying and teaching such powerful problem-solving concepts as the law of large numbers, statistical regression, cost-benefit analysis, sunk costs and opportunity costs, and causation and correlation, probing how best to teach others to use them effectively in their daily lives. In this groundbreaking book, he shows that a course in a given field&#8211;statistics or economics, for example&#8211;often doesn&#8217;t work as well as a few minutes of more practical instruction in analyzing everyday situations. Mindware shows how to reframe common problems in such a way that these powerful scientific and statistical concepts can be applied to them. The result is an enlightening and practical guide to the most powerful tools of reasoning ever developed&#8211;tools that can easily be used to make better professional, business, and personal decisions.</p>

                    Why can some people effortlessly command the attention of everyone in the room?    </p>
<p>                    What makes some individuals seem immediately credible and others appear inherently untrustworthy?    </p>
<p>                    And how is it that precisely the same idea can be enthusiastically embraced or roundly rejected depending on who has put it forward?    </p>
<p>                    When we talk to others, we assume that they are carefully weighing our words and arguments. But these are far from  being the only factors that hold sway.    </p>
<p>                    In this groundbreaking new book, bestselling behavioural scientists Stephen Martin and Joseph Marks explore the eight powerful human traits that help determine whether what we have to say gets heard or lands on deaf ears. They show how seemingly irrelevant details about our demeanour influence others&#8217; responses. They explain how trust is won, even when it may not be deserved. They show how the most trivial of signals &#8211; like the shape of our face, the shoes we wear or the car we drive &#8211; can influence how people respond to us.    </p>
<p>                    And in a world of uncertainty and fake news they demonstrate how, increasingly, the Messenger is the Message.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Some books make us better citizens. Others make us better at our jobs. This amazing book does both!&#8217;<br />

<p>                    &#8216;Messengers is engaging, informative and entertaining. It will change the way you think about who you follow and take advice from. But why would you listen to me? Read their book to find out.&#8217;<br />
                    Professor Tali Sharot, author of The Optimism Bias and The Influential Mind    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A powerful, profoundly illuminating exploration of one of the most important subjects of our time. Martin and Marks have a terrific talent for combining evidence and research with lively and vivid writing. Trust these messengers!&#8217;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology has become the architect of our intimacies. Online, we fall prey to the illusion of companionship, gathering thousands of Twitter and Facebook friends, and confusing tweets and wall posts with authentic communication. But this relentless connection leads to a new solitude. We turn to new technology to fill the void, but as MIT technology and society specialist Sherry Turkle argues, as technology ramps up, our emotional lives ramp down. Even the presence of sociable robots in our lives that pretend to demonstrate empathy makes us feel more isolated, as Turkle explains in a new introduction updating the book to the present day. Alone Together is the result of Turkle&#8217;s nearly fifteen-year exploration of our lives on the digital terrain. Based on interviews with hundreds of children and adults, it describes new, unsettling relationships between friends, lovers, parents, and children, and new instabilities in how we understand privacy and community, intimacy and solitude.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;Its theme is political fanaticism, with which it deals severely and brilliantly.&#8221;   -New Yorker    </p>
<p>                    The famous bestseller with &#8220;concise insight into what drives the mind of the fanatic and the dynamics of a mass movement&#8221; (Wall St. Journal) by the legendary San Francisco longshoreman.    </p>
<p>                    A stevedore on the San Francisco docks in the 1940s, Eric Hoffer wrote philosophical treatises in his spare time while living in the railroad yards. The True Believer-the first and most famous of his books-was made into a bestseller when President Eisenhower cited it during one of the earliest television press conferences.    </p>
<p>                    Called a &#8220;brilliant and original inquiry&#8221; and &#8220;a genuine contribution to our social thought&#8221; by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., this landmark in the field of social psychology is completely relevant and essential for understanding the world today as it delivers a visionary, highly provocative look into the mind of the fanatic and a penetrating study of how an individual becomes one.    </p>
<p>                    In times of crisis, the great works of philosophy help us make sense of the world. This book is part of the Harper Perennial Resistance Library, a special five-book series highlighting short classic works of independent thought that illuminate the nature of truth, humanity&#8217;s dangerous attraction to authoritarianism, the influence of media and mass communication, and the philosophy of resistance-all critical in understanding today&#8217;s politically charged world.</p>

<p>                    It  shapes every interaction we have, whether we&#8217;re trying to get a  two-year-old to eat green vegetables or ask for a promotion at work. But  how do we really gain and maintain power &#8211; through coercion or cooperation?  What does it do to our behaviour? And what makes us lose power? In  twenty revolutionary &#8216;power principles&#8217;, renowned psychologist Dacher  Keltner turns everything we thought we knew about influence and status  upside down, redefining power for our times.     </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Keltner is the  most interesting psychologist in America. It&#8217;s only a matter of time  before his ideas spread everywhere&#8217; Michael Lewis    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram carried out a series of experiments in which human subjects were given progressively more painful electro-shocks in a careful calibrated series to determine to what extent people will obey orders even when they knew them to be painful and immoral &#8211; to determine how people will obey authority regardless of consequences. These experiments came under heavy criticism at the time but have ultimately been vindicated by the scientific community.

<p>                    In this ground-breaking book world-renowned trust expert Rachel Botsman reveals that we are at the tipping point of one of the biggest social transformations in human history. We might have lost faith in institutions and leaders, but millions of people travel in cars with total strangers, exchange digital currencies, or find themselves trusting a bot.     </p>
<p>                    We still trust: but not the way we used to.    </p>
<p>                    If we are to benefit from this radical shift, we must understand how trust is built, managed, lost and repaired in the digital age. In the first book to explain this new world, Botsman provides a definitive guide of this uncharted landscape &#8211; and explores what&#8217;s next for humanity.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Brilliantly describes how the established trust framework is undergoing a radical transformation as digital technologies take root in every facet of our lives&#8217; Marc Benioff, Chairman &#038; CEO, Salesforce    </p>

<p>                    Issues of trust come attached to almost every human interaction, yet few people realize how powerfully their ability to determine trustworthiness predicts future success. David DeSteno&#8217;s cutting-edge research on reading trust cues with humanoid robots has already excited widespread media interest. In The Truth About Trust, the renowned psychologist shares his findings and debunks numerous popular beliefs, including Paul Zak&#8217;s theory that oxytocin is the &#8220;moral molecule.&#8221; From education and business to romance and dieting, DeSteno&#8217;s fascinating, paradigm-shifting book offers new insights and practical takeaways that will forever change how readers understand, communicate, and make decisions in every area of life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A breakthrough book on the transformative power of collaborative thinking    </p>
<p>                     Collaborative intelligence, or CQ, is a measure of our ability to think with others on behalf of what matters to us all. It is emerging as a new professional currency at a time when the way we think, interact, and innovate is shifting. In the past, &#8220;market share&#8221; companies ruled by hierarchy and topdown leadership. Today, the new market leaders are &#8220;mind share&#8221; companies, where influence is more important than power, and success relies on collaboration and the ability to inspire.    </p>
<p>                    Collaborative Intelligence is the culmination of more than fifty years of original research that draws on Dawna Markova&#8217;s background in cognitive neuroscience and her most recent work, with Angie McArthur, as a &#8220;Professional Thinking Partner&#8221; to some of the world&#8217;s top CEOs and creative professionals. Markova and McArthur are experts at getting brilliant yet difficult people to think together. They have been brought in to troubleshoot for Fortune 500 leaders in crisis and managers struggling to inspire their teams. When asked about their biggest challenges at work, Markova and McArthur&#8217;s clients all cite a common problem: other people. This response reflects the way we have been taught to focus on the gulfs between us rather than valuing our intellectual diversity&#8211;that is, the ways in which each of us is uniquely gifted, how we process information and frame questions, what kind of things deplete us, and what engages and inspires us. Through a series of practices and strategies, the authors teach us how to recognize our own mind patterns and map the talents of our teams, with the goal of embarking together on an aligned course of action and influence. In Markova and McArthur&#8217;s experience, managers who appreciate intellectual diversity will lead their teams to innovation; employees who understand it will thrive because they are in touch with their strengths; and an entire team who understands it will come together to do their best work in a symphony of collaboration, their individual strengths working in harmony like an orchestra or a high-performing sports team. Praise for Collaborative Intelligence    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Rooted in the latest neuroscience on the nature of collaboration, Collaborative Intelligence celebrates the power of working and thinking together at the highest levels of business and politics, and in the smallest aspects of our everyday lives. Dawna Markova and Angie McArthur show us that our ability to collaborate is not only a measure of intelligence, but essential to solving the world&#8217;s problems and seeing the possibilities in ourselves and others.&#8221;&#8211;Arianna Huffington  &#8220;This inspiring book teaches you how to align your intention with the intention of others, and how, through shared strengths and talents, you have every right to expect greatness and set the highest goals and expectations.&#8221;&#8211;Deepak Chopra  &#8220;Everyone talks about collaboration today, but the rhetoric typically outweighs the reality. Collaborative Intelligence offers tangible tools for those serious about becoming &#8216;system leaders&#8217; who can close the gap and make collaboration real.&#8221;&#8211;Peter M. Senge, author of The Fifth Discipline    </p>
<p>                    &#8220;I have worked with Markova and McArthur for several years, focusing on achieving better results through intellectual diversity. Their approach has encouraged more candid debate and collaborative behavior within the team. The team, not individuals, becomes the hero.&#8221;&#8211;Al Carey, CEO, PepsiCo</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We are profoundly social creatures&#8211;more than we know.      </p>
<p>                    In Social, renowned psychologist Matthew Lieberman explores groundbreaking research in social neuroscience revealing that our need to connect with other people is even more fundamental, more basic, than our need for food or shelter. Because of this, our brain uses its spare time to learn about the social world&#8211;other people and our relation to them. It is believed that we must commit 10,000 hours to master a skill. According to Lieberman, each of us has spent 10,000 hours learning to make sense of people and groups by the time we are ten.     </p>
<p>                     Social argues that our need to reach out to and connect with others is a primary driver behind our behavior. We believe that pain and pleasure alone guide our actions. Yet, new research using fMRI&#8211;including a great deal of original research conducted by Lieberman and his UCLA lab&#8211;shows that our brains react to social pain and pleasure in much the same way as they do to physical pain and pleasure. Fortunately, the brain has evolved sophisticated mechanisms for securing our place in the social world. We have a unique ability to read other people&#8217;s minds, to figure out their hopes, fears, and motivations, allowing us to effectively coordinate our lives with one another. And our most private sense of who we are is intimately linked to the important people and groups in our lives. This wiring often leads us to restrain our selfish impulses for the greater good. These mechanisms lead to behavior that might seem irrational, but is really just the result of our deep social wiring and necessary for our success as a species.     </p>
<p>                     Based on the latest cutting edge research, the findings in Social have important real-world implications. Our schools and businesses, for example, attempt to minimalize social distractions. But this is exactly the wrong thing to do to encourage engagement and learning, and literally shuts down the social brain, leaving powerful neuro-cognitive resources untapped. The insights revealed in this pioneering book suggest ways to improve learning in schools, make the workplace more productive, and improve our overall well-being.</p>

<p>                    A mix of popular psychology and trivia, You Are Now Less Dumb is grounded in the idea that we all believe ourselves to be objective observers of reality&#8211;except we&#8217;re not. But that&#8217;s okay, because our delusions keep us sane.     </p>
<p>                    Expanding on this premise, McRaney provides eye-opening analyses of seventeen ways we fool ourselves every day, including:<br />
                    Enclothed Cognition (the clothes you wear change your behavior and influence your mental abilities)The Benjamin Franklin Effect (how you grow to like people for whom you do nice things and hate the people you harm).Deindividuation (Despite our best intentions, we practically disappear when subsumed by a mob mentality)The Misattribution of Arousal (Environmental factors have a greater effect on our emotional arousal than the person right in front of us)Sunk Cost Fallacy (We will engage in something we don&#8217;t enjoy just to make the time or money already invested &#8220;worth it&#8221;)McRaney also reveals the true price of happiness, and how to avoid falling for our own lies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#038;ldquoKenrick writes like a dream.&#8221;- Robert Sapolsky, Professor of Biology and Neurology, Stanford University author of  A Primate&#8217;s Memoir  and  Why Zebras Don&#8217;t Get Ulcers  What do sex and murder have to do with the meaning of life? Everything. In  Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life , social psychologist Douglas Kenrick exposes the selfish animalistic underside of human nature, and shows how it is intimately connected to our greatest and most selfless achievements. Masterfully integrating cognitive science, evolutionary psychology, and complexity theory, this intriguing book paints a comprehensive picture of the principles that govern our lives. As Kenrick divulges, beneath our civilized veneer, human beings are a lot like howling hyenas and barking baboons, with heads full of homicidal tendencies and sexual fantasies. But, in his view, many ingrained, apparently irrational behaviours- such as inclinations to one-night stands, racial prejudices, and conspicuous consumption- ultimately manifest what he calls&#8221;Deep Rationality.&#8221;  Although our heads are full of simple selfish biases that evolved to help our ancestors survive, modern human beings are anything but simple and selfish cavemen. Kenrick argues that simple and selfish mental mechanisms we inherited from our ancestors ultimately give rise to the multifaceted social lives that we humans lead today, and to the most positive features of humanity, including generosity, artistic creativity, love, and familial bonds. And out of those simple mechanisms emerge all the complexities of society, including international conflicts and global economic markets. By exploring the nuance of social psychology and the surprising results of his own research, Kenrick offers a detailed picture of what makes us caring, creative, and complex- that is, fully human.   Illuminated with stories from Kenrick&#8217;s own colourful experiences &#8211;  from his criminally inclined shantytown Irish relatives, his own multiple high school expulsions, broken marriages, and homicidal fantasies, to his eventual success as an evolutionary psychologist and loving father of two boys separated by 26 years &#8211;  this book is an exploration of our mental biases and failures, and our mind&#8217;s great successes. Idiosyncratic, controversial, and fascinating,  Sex, Murder, and the Meaning of Life  uncovers the pitfalls and promise of our biological inheritance.</p>
