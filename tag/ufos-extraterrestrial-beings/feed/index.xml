										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Have we been visited by extraterrestrial beings? Did these ancient aliens contribute to the birth of human civilization? Do our ancient monuments contain evidence of their presence? The Ancient Alien Question reveals an array of astonishing truths, including: A radically different understanding of the pyramids and how they were constructed<br />
                    The origins of crystal skulls and how they were found<br />
                    The extraordinary stories behind monuments such as the Nazca lines and Puma Punku, and who built them<br />
                    How extraterrestrials came to our planet and the evidence that supports this Analyzing the historical and archaeological evidence, Philip Coppens demonstrates that there is substantial proof that our ancestors were far more technologically advanced than currently accepted, and that certain cultures interacted with non-human intelligences. Our ancestors were clearly not alone. Forty years after Erich von DÃ¤niken posed these questions in Chariots of the Gods, Coppens provides clear and concise answers to the great historical enigmas in a most accessible and readable format. Your view of human history will never be the same again!    </p>

<p>                    Coming back to the little community is like walking into a nightmare for Jim Gardener, poet, drunk, potential suicide.    </p>
<p>                    It all looks the same, the house, the furniture, Jim&#8217;s friend Bobbi, her beagle (though ageing), even the woods out at the back.    </p>
<p>                    But it was in the woods that Bobbi stumbled over the odd, part-buried object and felt a peculiar tingle as she brushed the soft earth away.    </p>
<p>                    Everything is familiar. But everything is about to change.    </p>
