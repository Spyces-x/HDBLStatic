										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A wildly vivid and entertaining chronicle of America&#8217;s manned space program, from the author of The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test    </p>
<p>                    `What is it&#8217; asks Tom Wolfe, `that makes a man willing to sit on top of an enormous Roman Candle&#8230;and wait for someone to light the fuse?&#8217; Arrogance? Stupidity? Bravery? Courage? Or, simply, that quality we call &#8216;the right stuff&#8217;?    </p>
<p>                    A monument to the men who battled to beat the Russians into space, The Right Stuff is a voyage into the mythology of the American space program, and a dizzying dive into the sweat, fear, beauty and danger of being on the white-hot edge of history in the making.    </p>
<p>                    `Tom Wolfe at his very best&#8230; Learned, cheeky, risky, touching, tough, compassionate, nostalgic, worshipful, jingoistic&#8230;The Right Stuff is superb&#8217; &#8211; New York Times Book Review    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back on the earth after three spaceflights, Chris Hadfield&#8217;s captivating memoir An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth reveals extraordinary stories from his life as an astronaut, and shows how to make the impossible a reality.    </p>
<p>                    Colonel Chris Hadfield has spent decades training as an astronaut and has logged nearly 4,000 hours in space. During this time he has broken into a Space Station with a Swiss army knife, disposed of a live snake while piloting a plane, been temporarily blinded while clinging to the exterior of an orbiting spacecraft, and become a YouTube sensation with his performance of David Bowie&#8217;s &#8216;Space Oddity&#8217; in space. The secret to Chris Hadfield&#8217;s success &#8211; and survival &#8211; is an unconventional philosophy he learned at NASA: prepare for the worst &#8211; and enjoy every moment of it.    </p>
<p>                    In his book, An Astronaut&#8217;s Guide to Life on Earth, Chris Hadfield takes readers deep into his years of training and space exploration to show how to make the impossible possible. Through eye-opening, entertaining stories filled with the adrenaline of launch, the mesmerizing wonder of spacewalks and the measured, calm responses mandated by crises, he explains how conventional wisdom can get in the way of achievement &#8211; and happiness. His own extraordinary education in space has taught him some counter-intuitive lessons: don&#8217;t visualize success, do care what others think, and always sweat the small stuff.    </p>
<p>                    You might never be able to build a robot, pilot a spacecraft, make a music video or perform basic surgery in zero gravity like Colonel Hadfield. But his vivid and refreshing insights in this book will teach you how to think like an astronaut, and will change, completely, the way you view life on Earth &#8211; especially your own.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An Economist book of the year.    </p>
<p>                    Fifty years ago, Christmas 1968, Man first orbited the Moon. This book tells the inside story of that epic journey.    </p>
<p>                    In early 1968, the Apollo programme was on shaky footing. President Kennedy&#8217;s end-of-decade deadline to put a man on the Moon was in jeopardy, and the Soviets were threatening to pull ahead in the space race.     </p>
<p>                    By August 1968, with its back against the wall, NASA decided to scrap its usual methodical approach and shoot for the heavens. With just four months to prepare, the agency would send the first men in history to the Moon.     </p>
<p>                    Focusing on three heroic astronauts and their families, this vivid, gripping narrative shows anew the epic danger and singular bravery it took for Man to leave Earth for the first time &#8211; and to arrive at a new world.</p>

<p>                    Eight key lessons to revolutionise your life with the mindset that got man to the moon.    </p>
<p>                    20th  July 1969: Neil Armstrong becomes the first person to walk on the Moon.  We all recognize this to be one of mankind&#8217;s greatest achievements. Yet  what did it take to make John F. Kennedy&#8217;s dream a reality?    </p>
<p>                    In  this remarkable book, Professor Richard Wiseman presents a pioneering  study of the mindset that took humanity to the Moon, and shows how you  can harness and use it to achieve the extraordinary in your everyday  life.    </p>
<p>                    Combining personal interviews, mission archives and  cutting-edge psychology, Wiseman embarks on the ultimate voyage through  inner space. Along the way he identifies eight key principles that make  up the Apollo Mindset, including how pessimism is crucial to success,  and how fear and tragedy can be transformed into hope and optimism.     </p>
<p>                    You  will discover a series of practical techniques that you can use to  incorporate these winning principles into both your professional and  personal life.  Whether you want to start a business venture, change  careers, find your perfect partner, raise a loving family, get promoted,  gain a new qualification, escape the rat race, or pursue a lifelong  passion, these techniques will help you to reach your own Moon.</p>
