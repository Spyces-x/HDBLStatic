										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This hands-on user&#8217;s guide to the groundbreaking Wheel of Awareness meditation practice featured in the New York Times bestseller Aware takes readers step-by-step through a twenty-one-day journey to discover what it means to be truly present and aware in our daily lives.     </p>
<p>                    In today&#8217;s increasingly fast-paced world it can be difficult to find moments to catch your breath, regain inner balance, and just . . . be. This simple yet profound guide shows readers how to strengthen their minds by learning to focus attention, open awareness, and develop a positive state of mind&#8211;the three pillars of mindfulness practice that research shows lead to greater physical and mental well-being.     </p>
<p>                    Psychiatrist and cofounder of the Mindsight Institute, Daniel J. Siegel, M.D., created the science-grounded meditation practice called the Wheel of Awareness to unlock the power of the brain to integrate its many functions and develop internal resources that lead to an enduring sense of calm and quiet. Packed with guided meditation instructions, practical exercises, and everyday tools and techniques, Becoming Aware meets readers where they are and offers a simple program to enhance our inner sense of clarity and even our interpersonal well-being.    </p>

<p>                     Every day we speak around 16,000 words &#8211; but inside minds we create tens of thousands more. </p>
<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.</p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.</p>
<p>                     Become aware of your true nature, learn to face your emotions with acceptance and generosity, act according to your deepest values, and flourish.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Drawing on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and mindfulness practices, this guide offers breakthrough insights and simple techniques for developing deep-seated, long-lasting confidence     </p>
<p>                     Too many of us miss out on opportunities in life because we lack self-confidence. Whether it&#8217;s public speaking, taking on a leadership role, or asking someone for a date, there are situations in which we just don&#8217;t feel equipped to handle the challenges we face.     </p>
<p>                     Russ Harris offers a surprising solution to low self-confidence, shyness, and insecurity: Rather than trying to &#8220;get over&#8221; our fears, he says, the secret is to form a new and wiser relationship with them. Paradoxically, it&#8217;s only when we stop struggling against our fearfulness that we begin to find lasting freedom from it.     </p>
<p>                     Drawing on the techniques of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a cutting-edge form of cognitive-behavioral therapy, The Confidence Gap explains how to:     </p>
<p>                     &#8211; Free yourself from common misconceptions about what confidence is and how to build it<br />
                     &#8211; Transform your relationship with fear and anxiety<br />
                     &#8211; Clarify your core values and use them as your inspiration and motivation<br />
                     &#8211; Use mindfulness to effectively handle negative thoughts and feelings.     </p>
<p>                     &#8220;This book could save you years of psychological struggle, yank you out of negative emotional patterns, and help propel you to a much happier, more productive life.&#8221; &#8211;Martha Beck, author and Oprah Winfrey&#8217;s life coach</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For fans of David Sedaris, Tina Fey and Caitlin Moran comes Furiously Happy from Jenny Lawson, author of the #1 New York Times bestseller Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened.    </p>
<p>                    In Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, Jenny Lawson regaled readers with uproarious stories of her bizarre childhood. In Furiously Happy she explores her lifelong battle with mental illness. A hysterical, ridiculous book about crippling depression and anxiety? That sounds like a terrible idea. And terrible ideas are what Jenny does best.    </p>
<p>                    As Jenny says: &#8216;You can&#8217;t experience pain without also experiencing the baffling and ridiculous moments of being fiercely, unapologetically, intensely and (above all) furiously happy.&#8217;  It&#8217;s a philosophy that has &#8211; quite literally &#8211; saved her life.    </p>
<p>                    Jenny&#8217;s first book, Let&#8217;s Pretend This Never Happened, was ostensibly about family, but deep down it was about celebrating your own weirdness. Furiously Happy is a book about mental illness, but under the surface it&#8217;s about embracing joy in fantastic and outrageous ways.  And who doesn&#8217;t need a bit more of that?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER and SHORTLISTED FOR THE WELLCOME BOOK PRIZE 2015     </p>
<p>                    As recently as thirty-five years ago, anxiety did not exist as a diagnostic category. Today, it is the most common form of officially classified mental illness. Scott Stossel gracefully guides us across the terrain of an affliction that is pervasive yet too often misunderstood.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own long-standing battle with anxiety, Stossel presents an astonishing history, at once intimate and authoritative, of the efforts to understand the condition from medical, cultural, philosophical and experiential perspectives. He ranges from the earliest medical reports of Galen and Hippocrates, through later observations by Robert Burton and Soren Kierkegaard, to the investigations by great nineteenth-century scientists, such as Charles Darwin, William James and Sigmund Freud, as they began to explore its sources and causes, to the latest research by neuroscientists and geneticists. Stossel reports on famous individuals who struggled with anxiety, as well as the afflicted generations of his own family. His portrait of anxiety reveals not only the emotion&#8217;s myriad manifestations and the anguish it produces, but also the countless psychotherapies, medications and other (often outlandish) treatments that have been developed to counteract it. Stossel vividly depicts anxiety&#8217;s human toll &#8211; its crippling impact, its devastating power to paralyse &#8211; while at the same time exploring how those who suffer from it find ways to manage and control it.    </p>
<p>                    My Age of Anxiety is learned and empathetic, humorous and inspirational, offering the reader great insight into the biological, cultural and environmental factors that contribute to the affliction.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to defeat stress, worry, and anxiety to achieve more in business and life. From the international bestselling author of Self-Confidence. Are You A Worrier? Do you seem to worry more than most? Do you find that insignificant things stress you out? Do you sweat the small stuff and the big stuff too? Well, now s the time to stop worrying and start living. Worry, stress, anxiety whichever label you prefer to use can have consequences that impact not only our lives, but the lives of others around us. When we worry it s like the engine of our mind is constantly being revved up. It doesn t allow us time to switch off and rest. It tires you out. And when you re tired you re less likely to think straight. And when you re not thinking straight it s easy to make stupid mistakes and confuse priorities&#8230;But relax. There is a way forward. In How Not to Worry Paul McGee shows us that there is a way to tackle life s challenges in a calmer and more considered way. It is possible to use a certain degree of worry and anxiety to spur us on towards positive, constructive action, and then leave the rest behind.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A TIME magazine Must-Read Book of the Year    </p>
<p>                    Ever wonder what your therapist is thinking? Now you can find out, as therapist and New York Times bestselling author Lori Gottlieb takes us behind the scenes of her practice &#8211; where her patients are looking for answers (and so is she).    </p>
<p>                    When a personal crisis causes her world to come crashing down, Lori Gottlieb &#8211; an experienced therapist with a thriving practice in Los Angeles &#8211; is suddenly adrift. Enter Wendell, himself a veteran therapist with an unconventional style, whose sessions with Gottlieb will prove transformative for her.    </p>
<p>                    As Gottlieb explores the inner chambers of her own patients&#8217; lives &#8211; a self-absorbed Hollywood producer, a young newlywed diagnosed with a terminal illness, a senior citizen who feels she has nothing to live for, and a self-destructive twenty-something who can&#8217;t stop hooking up with the wrong guys &#8211; she finds that the questions they are struggling with are the very questions she is bringing to Wendell.    </p>
<p>                    Taking place over one year, and beginning with the devastating event that lands her in Wendell&#8217;s office, Maybe You Should Talk to Someone offers a rare and candid insight into a profession that is conventionally bound with rules and secrecy. Told with charm and compassion, vulnerability and humour, it&#8217;s also the story of an incredible relationship between two therapists, and a disarmingly funny and illuminating account of our own mysterious inner lives, as well as our power to transform them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A pioneering researcher gives us a new understanding of stress and trauma, as well as the tools to heal and thrive.    </p>
<p>                    This groundbreaking book examines the cultural norms that impede resilience in America, especially our collective tendency to disconnect stress from its potentially extreme consequences and override our need to recover. It explains the science of how to direct our attention to perform under stress and recover from trauma, exploring how our survival brain and thinking brain react to traumatic situations differently.    </p>
<p>                    By directing our attention in particular ways, we can widen the window within which our thinking brain and survival brain work together cooperatively. When we use awareness to regulate our biology this way, we can access our best, uniquely human qualities: our compassion, courage, curiosity, creativity, and connection with others. By building our resilience, we can train ourselves to make wise decisions and access choice &#8211; even during times of incredible stress, uncertainty and change.    </p>
<p>                    With stories from men and women Dr Stanley has trained in settings as varied as military bases, healthcare facilities, as well as her own striking experiences with stress and trauma, she gives readers hands-on strategies they can use themselves, whether they want to perform under pressure or heal from traumatic experience, while at the same time pointing our understanding in a new direction.    </p>
<p>                    Foreword by Bessel Van Der Kolk, bestselling author of The Body Keeps the Score.    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;Widen the Window is a comprehensive overview of stress and trauma, responses to it, and tools for healing and thriving. It&#8217;s not only for those in high-intensity work, but for everyone.&#8217; &#8211; Mindful Magazine</p>

<p>                    Thoughts such as &#8216;I&#8217;m not spending enough time with my children&#8217; or &#8216;I&#8217;m not good enough to present my work&#8217; can seem to be unshakeable facts. In reality, they&#8217;re the judgemental opinions of our inner voice.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on more than twenty years of academic research and her own experiences, Susan David PhD, a psychologist and faculty member at Harvard Medical School, has pioneered a new way to make peace with our inner self, achieve our most valued goals and live life to the fullest.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alan Watts is the perfect guide for a course correction in life, away from materialism and its empty promise (Deepak Chopra). Here he shows us how&#8211;in an age of unprecedented anxiety&#8211;we must embrace the present and live fully in the now in order to live a fulfilling life.    </p>
<p>                    Spending all our time trying to anticipate and plan for the future and to lamenting the past, we forget to embrace the here and now. We are so concerned with tomorrow that we forget to enjoy today. Drawing from Eastern philosophy and religion, Alan Watts shows that it is only by acknowledging what we do not&#8211;and cannot&#8211;know that we can learn anything truly worth knowing.     </p>
<p>                    &#8220;Perhaps the foremost interpreter of Eastern disciplines for the contemporary West, Watts had the rare gift of &#8216;writing beautifully the unwritable.'&#8221; &#8211;Los Angeles Times</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>THE LIFE-CHANGING BESTSELLER &#8211; OVER 1.5 MILLION COPIES SOLD    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;A deeply compassionate guide to self-care &#8211; simple and profound&#8217; Sir Kenneth Branagh    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;If you want to free yourself from anxiety and stress, and feel truly at ease with yourself, then read this book&#8217; Ruby Wax    </p>
<p>                    Authoritative, beautifully written and much-loved by its readers, Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world has become a word-of-mouth bestseller and global phenomenon. It reveals a set of simple yet powerful practices that you can incorporate into daily life to break the cycle of anxiety, stress unhappiness and exhaustion. It promotes the kind of happiness that gets into your bones and allows you to meet the worst that life throws at you with new courage.     </p>
<p>                    Mindfulness is based on mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Co-developed by Professor Mark Williams of Oxford University, MBCT is recommended by the UK&#8217;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and is as effective as drugs for preventing depression. But, equally, it works for the rest of us who aren&#8217;t depressed but who are struggling to keep up with the relentless demands of the modern world.     </p>
<p>                    By investing just a few minutes each day, this classic guide to mindfulness will put you back in control of your life once again.</p>
