										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>**CHOSEN BY OPRAH AS ONE OF HER &#8216;BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH&#8217;**</p>
<p>                    The international bestselling spiritual book, now with a new look for its 20th anniversary. Eckhart Tolle demonstrates how to live a healthier, happier, mindful life by living in the present moment.</p>
<p>                    ************</p>
<p>                    &#8216;I keep Eckhart&#8217;s book at my bedside. I think it&#8217;s essential spiritual teaching. It&#8217;s one of the most valuable books I&#8217;ve ever read.&#8217; Oprah Winfrey</p>
<p>                    To make the journey into The Power of Now we will need to leave our analytical mind and its false created self, the ego, behind. Although the journey is challenging, Eckhart Tolle offers simple language and a question and answer format to show us how to silence our thoughts and create a liberated life.</p>
<p>                    Surrender to the present moment, where problems do not exist. It is here we find our joy, are able to embrace our true selves and discover that we are already complete and perfect. If we are able to be fully present and take each step in the Now we will be opening ourselves to the transforming experience of The Power of Now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Name of God is Mercy, Pope Francis&#8217; exploration on the universal theme of mercy, is a spiritual inspiration to both followers of Christianity and non-Christians around the world.    </p>
<p>                    Drawing on his own experience as a priest and shepherd, Pope Francis discusses mercy, a subject of central importance in his religious teaching and testimony, and in addition sums up other ideas &#8211; reconciliation, the closeness of God &#8211; that comprise the heart of his papacy. Written in conversation with Vatican expert and La Stampa journalist Andrea Tornielli, The Name of God is Mercy is directed at everyone, inside or outside of the Catholic Church, seeking meaning in life, a road to peace and reconciliation, or the healing of physical or spiritual wounds.</p>

<p>                    &#8216;The ultimate source of happiness is within us.&#8217; DALAI LAMA    </p>
<p>                    &#8216;We grow in kindness when our kindness is tested.&#8217; DESMOND TUTU    </p>
<p>                    Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama have been friends for many, many years. Between them, they have endured exile, violence and oppression. And in the face of these hardships, they have continued to radiate compassion, humour and above all, joy.    </p>
<p>                    To celebrate His Holiness&#8217;s eightieth birthday, Archbishop Tutu travelled to the Dalai Lama&#8217;s home in Dharamsala. The two men spent a week discussing a single burning question: how do we find joy in the face of suffering?    </p>
<p>                    This book is a gift from two of the most important spiritual figures of our time. Full of love, warmth and hope, The Book of Joy offers us the chance to experience their journey from first embrace to final goodbye.</p>
