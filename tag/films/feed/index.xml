<p>                                A Daily Mail Book of the Year. A Mail on SundayBook of the Year.</p>
<p>                                Famed American actress Demi Moore at last tells her own story in a surprisingly intimate and emotionally charged memoir.</p>
<p>                              For decades, Demi Moore has been synonymous with celebrity. From iconic film roles to high-profile relationships, Moore has never been far from the spotlight &#8211; or the headlines.</p>
<p>                              Even as Demi was becoming the highest paid actress in Hollywood, however, she was always outrunning her past, just one step ahead of the doubts and insecurities that defined her childhood. Throughout her rise to fame and during some of the most pivotal moments of her life, Demi battled addiction, body image issues, and childhood trauma that would follow her for years &#8211; all while juggling a skyrocketing career and at times negative public perception.  As her success grew, Demi found herself questioning if she belonged in Hollywood, if she was a good mother, a good actress &#8211; and, always, if she was simply good enough.</p>
<p>                              As much as her story is about adversity, it is also about tremendous resilience. In this deeply candid and reflective memoir, Demi pulls back the curtain and opens up about her career and personal life &#8211; laying bare her tumultuous relationship with her mother, her marriages, her struggles balancing stardom with raising a family, and her journey toward open heartedness. Inside Outis a story of survival, success, and surrender &#8211; a wrenchingly honest portrayal of one woman&#8217;s at once ordinary and iconic life.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First published in 1977, A Postillion Struck by Lightning is volume one of Dirk Bogarde&#8217;s best-selling memoirs</p>
<p>                    Following Bogarde from childhood through adolescence, to the beginnings of his budding career, A Postillion Struck by Lightning is a heartfelt memoir, offering insight into what created the drive and charisma that eventually made him a star. Dreamy, sun-soaked summers full of freedom spent with his younger sister are mixed with holidays in France and rambling the countryside.</p>
<p>                    Writing plays instead of playing sports, Dirk&#8217;s talents lay in the creativity of painting and expression rather than in the precision of maths or science, much to the growing concern of his parents. Packed off to live with relatives in Scotland, his father hoped that a proper Scottish education would equip his son to follow in his footsteps for a career in Newspapers.</p>
<p>                    In Scotland, Dirk learned to defend himself, to sound like a native Glaswegian, and to hide his intense homesickness. In essence; he learned to act.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>She was already well-known in some circles before March 6, 2018, but that&#8217;s probably the first time you heard the name Stormy Daniels. That&#8217;s the day she filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump over a nondisclosure agreement negotiated before the election but never signed. How did Stormy Daniels become the woman willing to take on a president? What is it like to be reviled by some, held up as a beacon of hope by others, and to be an object of fascination to all? In this book, Stormy Daniels tells her whole story for the first time: everything about the events that led to the nondisclosure agreement and the behind-the-scenes attempts to intimidate her, how she came to be a leading actress and director in the adult film business, and the full truth about her journey from a rough childhood in Louisiana onto the national stage.Stormy is funny, sharp, warm, and impassioned by turns. Her story is a thoroughly American one, of a girl who loved reading and horses and who understood from a very young age what she wanted ? and who also knew she&#8217;d have to get every step of the way there on her own.People can&#8217;t stop talking about Stormy Daniels. And they won&#8217;t be able to stop talking about her fresh, surprising, completely candid, nothing-held-back book.    </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The novelist who wrote The Grapes of Wrath and the director who produced Crisis and Lights Out in Europe combined their superb talents to tell the story of the coming of modern medicine to the natives of Mexico. There have been several notable examples of this pen-camera method of narration, but The Forgotten Village is unique among them in that Steinbeck wrote the text before a single picture was shot. The book and the movie from which The Forgotten Village was made have a continuity and a dramatic growth not to be found in typical documentary films of the time.    </p>
<p>                     From this wealth of pictures, 136 photographs were selected for their intrinsic beauty and for the graceful harmony with which they accompany Steinbeck&#8217;s text. This new script-photograph technique of narration conveys its ideas with unexcelled brilliance and immediacy. In the hands of such master storytellers as Steinbeck and Kline, it makes the reader catch his breath.    </p>
